Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?"],

According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be.

The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot.

Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't.

Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind.
