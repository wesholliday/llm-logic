            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a disjunction that says \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" We also have a negation that says \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" If it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, then the only remaining option from the disjunction is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden, but it allows for the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not logically imply that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because \"might not\" indicates a possibility, not a necessity. Fido might have the option to be in the garden or not, so we cannot infer the necessity from the possibility.\n\nQuestion 4: We have the same disjunction as in Question 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" The additional information is \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" which indicates a possibility but does not confirm where Fido is. Since this does not negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden, we cannot infer from these two statements alone that Fido is inside. There is still a possibility that Fido is in the garden, so we cannot make a definitive inference about Fido being inside.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
