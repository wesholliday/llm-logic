            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction. If it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then by elimination, the book must be on the shelf. So, yes, we can infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This does not necessarily mean that the book is definitely not on the table, but it does allow for the possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. So, yes, we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the book could still be resting on the table. It does not assert with certainty that the book must not be on the table. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which would require a definitive negation of the possibility of the book being on the table. So, no, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The first premise \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents a disjunction. The second premise \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces uncertainty about the book's location but does not definitively negate the possibility of the book being on the table. Since the second premise does not rule out the possibility of the book being on the table with certainty, we cannot conclude from these two premises alone that \"The book is on the shelf.\" So, no, we cannot infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
