            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with only one possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be under the couch at all; it just means that it's not certain. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which is a definitive statement about the necessity of the remote's location. Therefore, from the possibility that the remote might not be under the couch, we cannot infer that it must not be under the couch.\n\nQuestion 4: We have the premise \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and the additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The second statement introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch but does not eliminate the possibility. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and the second statement does not confirm the location of the remote, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on the possibility alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
