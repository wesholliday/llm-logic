            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that since it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, the only other option presented is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are:\n- \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe second premise introduces uncertainty about the location of the remote control. It suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not rule it out completely. Because there is still a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively infer that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is:\n- \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, it does not assert that it definitely is not under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" because the original statement allows for the possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch. The answer to the third question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
