            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are:\n- \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility that the sunglasses might not be on her head, but it does not exclude the possibility that they could still be on her head. Because there is still a possibility that the sunglasses are perched on her head, we cannot definitively infer that they are in her bag. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is:\n- \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not perched on her head. However, it does not assert with certainty that they must not be perched on her head. It leaves open the possibility that they could be perched on her head. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" because the original statement only speaks to a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, the answer to the third question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
