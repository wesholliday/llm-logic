            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving us with only one possibility that must be true: Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Since it's not definitive that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that Fido is inside based on these premises alone.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not assert that Fido definitely is not in the garden. To infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we would need a definitive statement that Fido cannot be in the garden. Since \"might not\" implies uncertainty rather than certainty, we cannot make a definitive inference that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
