            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are:\n- \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThe second premise introduces uncertainty about the book's location. It suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not rule out the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Because there is still a possibility that the book is on the table, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is:\n- \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not assert that the book must not be on the table. It leaves open the possibility that the book could be on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is necessarily the case that the book must not be resting on the table. The answer to the third question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
