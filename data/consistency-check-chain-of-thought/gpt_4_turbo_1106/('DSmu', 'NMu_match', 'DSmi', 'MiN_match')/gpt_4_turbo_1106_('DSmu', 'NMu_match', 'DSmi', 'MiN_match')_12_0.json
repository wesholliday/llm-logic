            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The first premise presents an either/or scenario, and the second premise negates one of those scenarios. If it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, then the only remaining option from the first premise is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does mean that the toy might not be there. So, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm it. Since the first premise is an either/or statement and the second premise does not definitively negate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box. The toy might be on the bookshelf, even though it might not necessarily be there.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not logically equate to \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which is a definitive statement about necessity. The possibility of the toy not being on the bookshelf does not negate the necessity that it could be there. Therefore, we cannot infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
