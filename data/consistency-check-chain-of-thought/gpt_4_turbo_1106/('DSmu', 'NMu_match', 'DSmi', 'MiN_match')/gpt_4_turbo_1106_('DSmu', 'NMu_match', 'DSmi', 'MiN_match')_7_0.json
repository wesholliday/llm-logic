            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" If the second premise is true, then the first part of the first premise must be true to satisfy the either/or condition. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This does not necessarily mean it is not there, but it does mean that it might not be there. So, we can infer that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could be there. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude the remote control being under the couch, we cannot infer with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these premises.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not equate to \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would imply a certainty that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. The possibility (might not be) does not negate the necessity (must be), so we cannot infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
