            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a disjunction that says the sock is either in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. We also have a negation that says it's not the case that the sock must be under the bed. Since the sock must be in one of the two places mentioned and it's not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket. So, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed' implies that there is no necessity for the sock to be under the bed. This does not preclude the possibility that the sock might still be under the bed, but it's not a certainty. Therefore, we can infer that the sock might not be under the bed. So, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' presents two possibilities. The additional information 'The missing sock might not be under the bed' does not eliminate the possibility that the sock could still be under the bed; it just means it's not certain to be there. Without certainty that the sock is not under the bed, we cannot definitively conclude that it is in the laundry basket. So, the answer is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement 'The missing sock might not be under the bed' suggests that there is uncertainty about the location of the sock. It does not assert that the sock must be under the bed. Therefore, it implies that it's not necessarily the case that the sock must be under the bed. So, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
