            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving us with only one possibility that must be true: \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden, but it does mean that Fido might not be in the garden. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm it. Since the first premise is a disjunction and the second premise does not definitively negate the possibility of Fido being in the garden, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Fido is inside.\" Fido might be inside, but it's not a definitive conclusion based on the given premises.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden. It's possible that Fido must be in the garden, but there's still a chance he might not be. Therefore, from the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
