            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction. If it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then by elimination, the milk must be on the counter. So, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does mean that it might not be. So, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it. Since the first premise is a strict disjunction and the second does not definitively negate the possibility of the milk being in the fridge, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk is on the counter. The milk might still be in the fridge, just not necessarily so.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" indicates that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not logically lead to the conclusion that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. The word \"might\" indicates possibility, not certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge based solely on the possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
