            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise. Since it cannot be the case that the book must be resting on the table, the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This does not necessarily mean that the book is not on the table, but it does mean that it might not be there. So, from this statement, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nQuestion 3: We have the premise \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and the additional information \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The second statement introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm it. Since it does not confirm the location of the book, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on the possibility that it might not be on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not logically equate to \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which is a definitive statement about the necessity of the book's location. The possibility (might not be) does not negate the necessity (must be), so we cannot infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
