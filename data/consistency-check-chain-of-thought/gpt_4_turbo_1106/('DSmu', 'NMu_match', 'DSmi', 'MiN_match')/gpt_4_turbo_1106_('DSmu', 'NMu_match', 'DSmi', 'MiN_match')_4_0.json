            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" If it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then by the process of elimination from the first premise, the cookies must be in the jar. So, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This does not necessarily mean they are not there, but it does mean they might not be there. So, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not confirm it. Since it does not confirm the location of the cookies, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar. So, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not equate to the certainty implied by \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" The former is about possibility, while the latter is about necessity. Therefore, from the possibility that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, we cannot infer the certainty that it's not the case that they must be hidden there. So, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
