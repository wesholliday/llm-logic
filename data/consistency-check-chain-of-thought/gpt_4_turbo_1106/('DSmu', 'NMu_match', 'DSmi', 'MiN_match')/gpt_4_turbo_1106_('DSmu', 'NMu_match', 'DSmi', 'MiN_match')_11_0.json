            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second premise negates one of the disjuncts. If it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, then by elimination, the jacket must be draped over the chair. So, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. This does not necessarily mean that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does mean that it might not be. So, we can infer that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nQuestion 3: The first premise is \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet,\" and the second premise is \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not confirm it. Since we do not have a definitive statement negating that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, we cannot infer with certainty that the jacket is draped over the chair. The jacket might still be hanging in the closet, despite the possibility that it might not be.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty, not a definitive negation of necessity. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
