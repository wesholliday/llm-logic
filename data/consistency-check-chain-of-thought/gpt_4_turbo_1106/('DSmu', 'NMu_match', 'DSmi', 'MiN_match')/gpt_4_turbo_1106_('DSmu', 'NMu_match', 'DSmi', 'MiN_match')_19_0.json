            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" The second statement negates one of the options presented in the first statement, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This does not necessarily mean they are not on her head, but it does mean that they might not be. So, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nQuestion 3: The first statement gives us two possibilities: the sunglasses are either in her bag or they must be on her head. The second statement tells us that it's possible the sunglasses are not on her head. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the sunglasses could still be on her head; it just means it's not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on the possibility that they might not be on her head.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This is consistent with the idea that it's not a certainty that they must be on her head. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
