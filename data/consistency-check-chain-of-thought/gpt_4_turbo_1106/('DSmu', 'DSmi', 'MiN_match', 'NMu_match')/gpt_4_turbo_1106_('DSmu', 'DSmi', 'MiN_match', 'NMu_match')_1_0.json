            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction. If it's not true that the book must be resting on the table, then by elimination, the book must be on the shelf. So, the answer is yes, we can infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the book resting on the table but does not definitively negate the possibility that the book could be on the table. Since there is still a possibility that the book is on the table, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf. So, the answer is no, we cannot infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not assert that it must not be on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer the stronger statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which would imply that there is no possibility of the book being on the table. So, the answer is no, we cannot infer that statement.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. If it's not certain that the book is on the table, then it is possible that the book might not be resting on the table. So, the answer is yes, we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
