            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot conclusively infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This implies that there is uncertainty about the location of the toy, and it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This does not equate to the definitive statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which would require certainty that the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf. Therefore, from the given premise, we cannot infer the more definitive statement.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that we are certain the toy does not have to be on the bookshelf, which implies that there is at least a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
