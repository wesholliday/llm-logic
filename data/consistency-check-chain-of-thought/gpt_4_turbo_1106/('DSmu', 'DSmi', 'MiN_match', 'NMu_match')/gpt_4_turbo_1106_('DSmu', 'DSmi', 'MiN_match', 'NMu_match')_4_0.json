            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be there. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the cookies being in the pantry, we cannot conclusively infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" This statement implies uncertainty about the location of the cookies in the pantry; it does not assert that the cookies must not be in the pantry. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer the stronger statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" which would require a definitive negation of the possibility that the cookies are in the pantry.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This statement definitively negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry. If it's not the case that the cookies must be there, then it is possible that they might not be there. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
