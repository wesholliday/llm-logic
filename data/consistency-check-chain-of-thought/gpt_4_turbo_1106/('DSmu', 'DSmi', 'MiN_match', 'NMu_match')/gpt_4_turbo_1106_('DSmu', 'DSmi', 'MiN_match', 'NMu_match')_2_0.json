            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a disjunction that says the keys are either in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. We also have a negation that says it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. If it's not the case that the keys must be in the cabinet, then the only other option given by the disjunction is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not exclude the possibility that they could still be there. Since this statement does not definitively exclude the cabinet as a location for the keys, we cannot infer with certainty that the keys are in the drawer based on this information alone.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This is different from saying \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which definitively states that the keys cannot be in the cabinet as a matter of necessity. However, if the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it implies that it's not a necessity that they are there, so we can infer that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
