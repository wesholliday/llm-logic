            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates one of the options in the first premise, leaving us with only one possibility: Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Since the second premise does not provide certainty, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside based on these premises alone.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" allows for the possibility that Fido could be in the garden, whereas \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" definitively states that Fido cannot be required to be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer the latter from the former.\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that Fido is not required to be in the garden. This implies that there is at least the possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" from the statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nNow, I will provide the answers to all four questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
