            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The first premise presents a dichotomy: the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. The second premise negates one of these options, stating that the milk is definitely not in the fridge. Therefore, by process of elimination, the milk must be on the counter. So the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not definitively exclude the fridge as the location of the milk. Since there is still a possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk is on the counter. So the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, it does not assert with certainty that the milk must not be in the fridge. The statement allows for the possibility that the milk could be in the fridge, but it is not a necessity. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" with absolute certainty, because the original statement does not exclude the possibility that the milk could still be chilling in the fridge. So the answer to the third question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the milk being in the fridge is not a necessity; it is not required to be there. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" So the answer to the fourth question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
