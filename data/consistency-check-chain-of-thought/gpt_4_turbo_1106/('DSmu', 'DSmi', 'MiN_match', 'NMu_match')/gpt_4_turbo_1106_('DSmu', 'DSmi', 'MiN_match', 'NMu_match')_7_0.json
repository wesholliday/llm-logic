            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could be there. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" This statement implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control, suggesting that it is possible that the remote is not under the couch. However, it does not assert with certainty that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer the stronger statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would require a definitive negation of the possibility.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This statement definitively negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch. If it must not be hiding under the couch, then it is possible that it might not be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
