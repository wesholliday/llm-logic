            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n1. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are:\n1. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility that the remote control might not be under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since there is still a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it is on the coffee table based solely on the information given. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
