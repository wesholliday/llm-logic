            "content": "For Question 1, we have two statements:\n\n1. Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that since it is not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, the only other option presented is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nFor Question 2, we have:\n\n1. Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility that the toy might not be on the bookshelf, but it does not exclude the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Since there is uncertainty about the location of the toy (it might or might not be on the bookshelf), we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box based on the information given. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
