            "content": "For Question 1, we have two premises:\n\n1. Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then the only other option presented is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nFor Question 2, we have:\n\n1. Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility (might not be), not a certainty. Just because the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could still be in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter based on the information given. The answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
