It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nFor Question 2, we have:\n\n1. Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n2. The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility that the book might not be on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Since there is still a possibility that the book is on the table, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on the information given. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
