            "content": "For Question 1, we have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nFor Question 2, the premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively exclude the possibility that Fido is in the garden. Since the second premise does not provide a certainty that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that Fido is inside based solely on these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
