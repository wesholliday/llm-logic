It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then the only other option given by the first statement is that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nFor Question 2, we have:\n\n1. Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n\nThe second statement here introduces a possibility but does not confirm that the cookies are definitely not in the pantry. It only suggests that there is a chance that the cookies are not in the pantry. Since this does not eliminate the possibility that the cookies could still be in the pantry, we cannot infer with certainty that the cookies are in the jar based on the information given. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
