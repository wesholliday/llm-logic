It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that if it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then the only other option given by the first statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nFor Question 2, we have:\n\n1. Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n2. The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, but it does not exclude the possibility that they could still be perched on her head. Since there is uncertainty and not a definitive exclusion of the second option, we cannot infer with certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
