            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n1. Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are:\n1. Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, but it does not exclude the possibility that they could still be dangling there. Since there is uncertainty about the location of the keys (they might or might not be in the cabinet), we cannot definitively conclude that they are in the drawer based on the information given. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
