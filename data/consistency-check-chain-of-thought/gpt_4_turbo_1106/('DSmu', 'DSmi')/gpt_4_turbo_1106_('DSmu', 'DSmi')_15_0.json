It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nFor Question 2, the premises are:\n\n1. Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\n2. The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility that the pen might not be on the desk, but it does not exclude the possibility that the pen could still be on the desk. Since there is no certainty provided by the second premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
