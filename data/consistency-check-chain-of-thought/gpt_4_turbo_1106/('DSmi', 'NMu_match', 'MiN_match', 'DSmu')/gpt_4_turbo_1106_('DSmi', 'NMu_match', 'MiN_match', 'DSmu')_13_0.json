            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is still in the fridge; it just acknowledges that there is a possibility that it is not. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter just from these two statements.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that it is not a certainty that the milk is in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, but rather that it is not a requirement. However, if it is not a requirement (must), then it is possible (might not) that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. So, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 3: If we say \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we are acknowledging the possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the milk to be in the fridge, just that it is not certain. Therefore, from this statement alone, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 4: If we have the premise \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and we also know \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then we can infer that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and the second premise eliminates the fridge as a necessity, the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
