            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This does not necessarily mean that it might not be there, but it does mean that there is no requirement for it to be there. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control under the couch. It does not assert that the remote control must not be under the couch, just that it's a possibility that it isn't. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because \"might not be\" does not equate to \"must not be.\"\n\nQuestion 4: We have two premises again: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" If it's not the case that the remote must be under the couch, then the only other option presented by the first premise is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
