            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude Fido being in the garden, we cannot infer with certainty that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. This does not mean that Fido cannot be in the garden, but it does mean that there is no necessity for Fido to be there. This allows for the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden. \"Might not\" implies uncertainty and does not exclude the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" based solely on the statement that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates one part of the disjunction in the first premise, leaving us with the only other option that Fido is inside. If Fido must not be in the garden, then the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside. The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
