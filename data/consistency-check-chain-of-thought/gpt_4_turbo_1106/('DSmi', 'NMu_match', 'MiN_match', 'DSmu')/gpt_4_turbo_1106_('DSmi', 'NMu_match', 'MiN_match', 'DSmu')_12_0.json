            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement presents a dichotomy: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf but does not rule it out completely. Since the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf is not eliminated, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean that the toy cannot be on the bookshelf, just that it is not required to be there. Therefore, it is possible that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This does not assert with certainty that the toy is not on the bookshelf, just that it is a possibility. However, it does imply that it's not necessarily the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The first statement again presents a dichotomy, and the second statement rules out the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf. If it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, and those were the only two options presented, then we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
