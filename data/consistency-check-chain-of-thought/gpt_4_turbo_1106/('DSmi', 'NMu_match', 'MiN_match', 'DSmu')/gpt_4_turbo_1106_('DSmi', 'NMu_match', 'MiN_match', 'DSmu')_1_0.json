            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude the book being on the table, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf. So the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The premise \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that the book is not necessarily on the table. This does not mean that the book cannot be on the table, but rather that it is not required to be there. This allows for the possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. So the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not mean that it is impossible for the book to be on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" because the original statement does not exclude the possibility that the book could be there by necessity. So the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the book being on the table, which means the only remaining option from the first premise is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. So the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
