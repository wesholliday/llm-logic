            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we add the information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. It only suggests that it's a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and it's also true that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the remote control cannot be under the couch by necessity. This leaves us with the only other option presented, which is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" indicates uncertainty about the location of the remote control. It does not assert that the remote control definitely isn't under the couch, just that it's a possibility. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because \"might not be\" does not equate to \"must not be.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
