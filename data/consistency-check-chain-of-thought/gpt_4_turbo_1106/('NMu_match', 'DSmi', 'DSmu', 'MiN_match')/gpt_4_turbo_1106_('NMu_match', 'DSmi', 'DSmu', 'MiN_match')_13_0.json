            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not in the fridge, but it opens up the possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the milk could still be in the fridge. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and also that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" we can infer that the milk must be on the counter. Since the necessity of the milk being in the fridge is negated, the only remaining option from the original either/or statement is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the milk to be in the fridge. \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" would mean that there is no requirement for the milk to be in the fridge at all, which is a stronger statement than \"might not be.\" Therefore, from \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
