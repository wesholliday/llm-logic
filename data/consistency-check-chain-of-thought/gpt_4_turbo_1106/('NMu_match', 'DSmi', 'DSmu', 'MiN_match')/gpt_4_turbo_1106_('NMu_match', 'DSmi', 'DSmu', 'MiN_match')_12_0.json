            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This allows for the possibility that the toy might not be on the bookshelf. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we know that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the toy is in the toy box because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not there. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" combined with \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is negated. If the toy must not be on the bookshelf, then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies uncertainty about the location of the toy. It suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm that the toy must not be there. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because \"might not be\" does not equate to \"must not be.\" The answer is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
