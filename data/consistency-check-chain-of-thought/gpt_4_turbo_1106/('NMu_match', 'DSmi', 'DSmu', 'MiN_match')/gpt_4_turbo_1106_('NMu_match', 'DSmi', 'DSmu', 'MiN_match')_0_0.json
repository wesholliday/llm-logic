            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden, but it does allow for the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. It only suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and also that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer that Fido is inside. Since the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated, the only remaining option from the original either/or statement is that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden. \"Might not be\" is about possibility, not certainty or necessity. Therefore, from the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
