            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" suggests that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean Fido is not in the garden, but it opens up the possibility that Fido might be somewhere else. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. \"Might not\" indicates uncertainty, not a definitive negation of necessity. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not definitively eliminate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden, as \"might not\" suggests uncertainty rather than certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that \"Fido is inside\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
