            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet. This means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the jacket to be in the closet. It does not negate the possibility that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, it just acknowledges the possibility that it might not be. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" then the necessity of the jacket being in the closet is negated. Since the jacket must not be in the closet, and the only other option provided is that the jacket is draped over the chair, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" introduces uncertainty about the jacket being in the closet but does not eliminate the possibility that it could be there. Since there is still a possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet, we cannot definitively infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
