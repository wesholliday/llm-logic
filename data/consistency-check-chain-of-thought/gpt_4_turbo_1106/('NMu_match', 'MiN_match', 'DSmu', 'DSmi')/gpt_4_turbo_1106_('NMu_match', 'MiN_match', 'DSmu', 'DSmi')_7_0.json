            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no certainty about the remote control being under the couch. This allows for the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. So, the inference \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" is a valid one.\n\nQuestion 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the remote control to be under the couch. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because the latter suggests that there is no possibility of the remote being under the couch, which is a stronger statement than just \"might not be.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original disjunction is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be. Since there is still a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
