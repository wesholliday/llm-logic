            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise introduces uncertainty about the second condition but does not rule it out completely. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude the possibility of the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, we have two premises:\n- \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe first premise is the same as in Question 1, presenting a disjunction. The second premise, however, definitively states that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. This means that the condition of the remote control \"must be hiding under the couch\" is false. Since one of the two conditions must be true and the second one is negated, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: We have one premise:\n- \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis premise suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not assert this as a definite fact. It does not exclude the possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because the premise does not establish necessity, only possibility.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
