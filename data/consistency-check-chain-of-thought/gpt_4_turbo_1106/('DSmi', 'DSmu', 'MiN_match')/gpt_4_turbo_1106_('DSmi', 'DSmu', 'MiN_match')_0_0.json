Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement is a logical disjunction that says Fido is either inside or in the garden. The second statement introduces a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Since there is still a possibility that Fido is in the garden, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 2: The first statement again presents a disjunction where Fido is either inside or in the garden. The second statement now tells us that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, which means Fido is definitely not in the garden. Since the disjunction must be true and Fido cannot be in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests that there is uncertainty about Fido's presence in the garden. It does not assert with certainty that Fido is not in the garden; it only opens up the possibility that Fido may not be there. On the other hand, 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' is a definitive statement indicating that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. The first statement does not necessarily imply the second because 'might not be' does not equate to 'must not be'. Therefore, the answer to the third question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
