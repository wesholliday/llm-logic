            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could be on the table. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude the book being on the table, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to the first question is no.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, we have the same first premise, but the second premise is now \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which means that the book definitely is not on the table. Since the disjunction in the first premise tells us that if the book is not on the table, it must be on the shelf, and the second premise confirms that the book is not on the table, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to the second question is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise \"The book might not be resting on the table\" indicates uncertainty about the location of the book. It suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not assert this as a fact. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" is a definitive statement that the book cannot be on the table. Since the possibility (might not) does not equate to certainty (must not), we cannot infer the latter statement from the former. Therefore, the answer to the third question is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
