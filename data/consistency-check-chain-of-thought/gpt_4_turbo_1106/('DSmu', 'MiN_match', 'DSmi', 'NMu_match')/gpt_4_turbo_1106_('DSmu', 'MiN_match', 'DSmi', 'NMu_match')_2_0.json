            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" The first premise presents an either/or scenario, and the second premise negates one of those scenarios. If it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, then by elimination, the keys must be in the drawer. So, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's certain that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. \"Might not\" implies uncertainty, whereas \"must not\" implies certainty. Therefore, from the statement that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not eliminate the possibility that they could be. Since the second premise does not definitively negate the possibility of the keys dangling in the cabinet, we cannot infer with certainty that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" indicates that there is no necessity for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
