            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This does not necessarily mean that it's certain the cookies must not be hidden in the pantry, which would be a stronger claim. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the location of the cookies but does not definitively exclude the pantry as a possibility. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the cookies being in the pantry, we cannot infer with certainty that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" indicates that it is not a necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
