            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, it does not categorically state that the book must not be resting on the table. It leaves open the possibility that the book could be on the table. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" because the latter suggests a certainty that the book is not on the table, which is not implied by the original statement.\n\nQuestion 3: The first premise is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" and the second premise is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table but does not eliminate the possibility. Since the first premise presents a dichotomy and the second does not definitively negate either option, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf based solely on these premises.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" indicates that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" as it aligns with the idea that there is no requirement for the book to be there.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
