            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second premise negates one of the disjuncts. If it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then by elimination, the milk must be on the counter. So, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not necessarily mean that it must not be chilling in the fridge. \"Might not\" indicates uncertainty, whereas \"must not\" indicates certainty. Therefore, from the statement that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, we cannot infer with certainty that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the location of the milk but does not definitively exclude the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the milk being in the fridge, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" indicates that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
