            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates one of the options in the first premise, leaving us with only one possibility that must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for Fido to be in the garden. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. While the first statement suggests uncertainty, it does not confirm the absence of necessity. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first with certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: The first premise is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" and the second premise is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that Fido may not be in the garden, but it does not eliminate the necessity that he could be there. Since the necessity is not negated, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This implies that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nNow, I will provide the answers to all four questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
