            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second premise negates one of the disjuncts. If it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, then the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. \"Might not be\" indicates uncertainty, whereas \"must not be\" indicates certainty. Therefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: Similar to Question 1, we have the premise \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The second premise, \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" introduces uncertainty about the location of the toy but does not definitively exclude the possibility that the toy is on the bookshelf. Because we do not have a definitive negation of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" indicates that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
