            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The first premise presents an either/or scenario, and the second premise negates one of those scenarios. If it's not the case that the remote must be hiding under the couch, then the only remaining option from the either/or scenario is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not exclude the possibility that it could be hiding there. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty that the remote is under the couch. The first statement does not necessarily imply the second because \"might not be\" is about possibility, whereas \"must not be\" is about certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch but does not rule it out completely. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility of the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote is on the coffee table based on these premises.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that there is no necessity for the remote to be under the couch. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
