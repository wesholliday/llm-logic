            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an either/or scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet; it just acknowledges that there is a possibility that it is not. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair because the jacket still might be hanging in the closet.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, we have the disjunction \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\" The second premise now states, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which negates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet. This means that the jacket cannot be in the closet, so the only remaining option from the disjunction is that the jacket is draped over the chair. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" This means that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet, which implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" which suggests uncertainty about the location of the jacket. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. \"Might not be\" is about possibility, not certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" because the jacket still could be there as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
