            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement presents a dichotomy: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf but does not eliminate the possibility. Since the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf is not ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The first statement is the same as in Question 1. The second statement, however, is stronger than in Question 1. It states that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, which means the toy cannot be on the bookshelf. Given the dichotomy in the first statement, if the toy is not on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' suggests that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which is equivalent to saying 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' indicates that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the toy to be on the bookshelf. It does not affirm that the toy must not be on the bookshelf, only that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' from this statement alone.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answers are:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
