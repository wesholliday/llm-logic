            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden; it just suggests that it's not certain. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" eliminates the possibility that Fido is necessarily in the garden, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" indicates that Fido being in the garden is not a certainty. This implies that there is a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's certain that Fido is not in the garden (i.e., Fido must not be in the garden). It allows for the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" based solely on the possibility that Fido might not be there.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
