            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" is not a definitive negation. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" definitively negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" indicates that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, which is equivalent to saying \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not exclude the possibility that the book could be on the table. It does not definitively negate the necessity of the book being on the table. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" because \"might not\" does not equate to \"must not.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
