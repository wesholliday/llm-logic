            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second premise introduces a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, the second premise does not definitively exclude the possibility that the sunglasses are on her head; it only suggests that they might not be. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag because the possibility remains that they could still be on her head.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, we have the same first premise, but the second premise is now \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This premise definitively states that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. Since the first premise presents an \"either/or\" scenario and the second premise rules out one of the options, we can infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This statement implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head, which means they might or might not be perched there. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" This statement suggests uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses on her head but does not rule out the possibility that they could be there. It does not assert that the sunglasses must not be on her head, only that there is a possibility they are not. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" because \"might not\" does not equate to \"must not.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
