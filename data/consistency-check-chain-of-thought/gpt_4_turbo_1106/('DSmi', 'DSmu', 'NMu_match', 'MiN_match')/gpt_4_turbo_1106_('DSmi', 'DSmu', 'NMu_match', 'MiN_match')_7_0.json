            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first premise is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. The second premise introduces uncertainty about the second condition (it \"might not\" be true). However, because the second premise does not definitively exclude the possibility of the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote is on the coffee table. The possibility remains that the remote could be under the couch or somewhere else not mentioned.\n\nQuestion 2: Similar to the first question, we have a logical disjunction. The second premise in this case is stronger, stating that it is not the case that the remote \"must\" be hiding under the couch. This negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the coffee table as the only remaining option provided by the initial statement. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise states that it is not necessarily true that the remote is hiding under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, which is equivalent to saying \"The remote might not be hiding under the couch.\" So, we can infer the given conclusion from the premise.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise here suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the remote could still be under the couch; it just isn't certain. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is definitively not the case that the remote must be hiding under the couch, because \"might not\" implies uncertainty rather than certainty.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answers are:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
