            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry. This means that there is no requirement for the cookies to be in the pantry, which implies that it is possible that the cookies are not there. Therefore, we can infer \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" eliminates the second possibility. Since the second option is negated and the statement is an either/or proposition, we are left with the first option as the only possibility. Therefore, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" does not eliminate the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not there. Since there is no definitive negation of the second possibility, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not necessarily negate the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry; it only acknowledges the possibility that they might not be. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" because the necessity (must) is not addressed by the mere possibility (might not).\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
