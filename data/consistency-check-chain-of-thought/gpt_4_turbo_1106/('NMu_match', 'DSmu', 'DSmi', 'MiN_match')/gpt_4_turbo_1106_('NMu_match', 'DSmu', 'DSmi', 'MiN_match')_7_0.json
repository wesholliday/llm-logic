            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the location of the remote control but does not eliminate the possibility that it could be under the couch. Since there is still a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on this statement.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be under the couch at all. The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty, not a definitive negation of the possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" because the remote control still could be there; it's just not certain.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
