            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This allows for the possibility that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. So, the inference \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" is a valid one.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" eliminates the second possibility, leaving only the first one. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" does not eliminate the second possibility entirely; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Since it's not definitive, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This means that it is not a necessity for the sunglasses to be perched on her head. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
