            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This implies uncertainty about the location of the keys. The inference \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not a certainty that the keys are in the cabinet. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, it is consistent with the idea that their being there is not a certainty. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" we are dealing with the possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but this does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be there. Since there is still a possibility that the keys could be dangling in the cabinet, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The keys are in the drawer\" based solely on the information given. We would need a definitive statement that the keys are not in the cabinet to make that inference.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" indicates that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. This means that the keys could be elsewhere. This is equivalent to saying \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" which expresses the possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" then we have eliminated the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet. Since the original statement presents an either-or scenario and one of the possibilities (the keys must be dangling in the cabinet) has been negated, we are left with the other possibility, which is that \"The keys are in the drawer.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
