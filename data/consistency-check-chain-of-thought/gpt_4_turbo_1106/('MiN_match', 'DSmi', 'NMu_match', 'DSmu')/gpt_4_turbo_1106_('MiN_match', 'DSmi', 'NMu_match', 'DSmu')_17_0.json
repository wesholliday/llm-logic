            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This implies uncertainty about the location of the notebook. If it might not be there, then it is not necessarily there, which means it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. So, the inference is correct.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be on the nightstand. It only suggests that there is a possibility that it is not on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" means that there is no necessity for the notebook to be on the nightstand. This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which is the same as saying \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\" So, the inference is correct.\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" and it is also true that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" then we can conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer because the other possibility (that it must be on the nightstand) has been negated. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
