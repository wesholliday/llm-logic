            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means that it is not certain that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The toy is in the toy box\" because \"might not\" implies a possibility, not a certainty. The toy could still be on the bookshelf, just not necessarily so.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This means that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. If it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, then the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is removed. Since the toy must be in one of the two places, and it must not be on the bookshelf, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
