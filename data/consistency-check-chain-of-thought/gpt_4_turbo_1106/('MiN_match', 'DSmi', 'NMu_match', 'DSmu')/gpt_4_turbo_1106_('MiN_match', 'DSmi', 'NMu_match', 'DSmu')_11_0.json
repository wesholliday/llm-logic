            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies uncertainty about the location of the jacket. It suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. This statement is compatible with \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which asserts that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet. So, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" is a statement of two possibilities, one of which must be true. When combined with \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" we are faced with uncertainty about the second possibility. However, the uncertainty of the jacket hanging in the closet does not confirm that the jacket is draped over the chair. It only suggests that it might be one of the possibilities, but it does not rule out other possibilities (like the jacket being somewhere else entirely). Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet, which implies that there is a possibility of the jacket being elsewhere. This is equivalent to saying \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" because both statements allow for the possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer the third statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two exclusive options. If we know that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" then the necessity of the jacket being in the closet is negated. This leaves us with the only other option presented in the original statement, which is that the jacket is draped over the chair. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
