            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This implies uncertainty about Fido's location. If it's not certain that Fido is in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden, because \"must\" implies certainty or necessity. Therefore, from the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The first premise is a logical disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true. The second premise casts doubt on the second part of the disjunction, suggesting that it's not certain that Fido must be in the garden. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden, just that it's not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on these premises.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" directly implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This means that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Again, we have the premises \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" If it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, then the necessity of Fido being in the garden is ruled out. Given the disjunction, if one part is negated (Fido must be in the garden), the other part must be true (Fido is inside). Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
