            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control. The inference \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty that the remote control is under the couch. Since the original statement casts doubt on the remote control being under the couch, it supports the inference that it is not a certainty. So, the answer to question 1 is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that it is on the coffee table because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. It only suggests that there is a possibility that it is not under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" So, the answer to question 2 is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" So, the answer to question 3 is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 4: Again, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" we can eliminate the possibility that it must be under the couch. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility presented by the original statement, which is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" So, the answer to question 4 is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
