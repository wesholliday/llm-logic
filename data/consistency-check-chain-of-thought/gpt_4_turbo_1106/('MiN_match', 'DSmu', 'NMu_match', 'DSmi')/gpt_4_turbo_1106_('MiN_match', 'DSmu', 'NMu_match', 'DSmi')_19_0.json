            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. The inference \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not a certainty that the sunglasses are on her head. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, it supports the inference that they do not have to be there. So, the answer to question 1 is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\" Therefore, the answer to question 2 is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" indicates that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, which is what \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests. Thus, the answer to question 3 is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" does not eliminate the possibility that the sunglasses are on her head; it only suggests that they might not be. Since the certainty of the location is not established, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be on her head. Therefore, the answer to question 4 is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
