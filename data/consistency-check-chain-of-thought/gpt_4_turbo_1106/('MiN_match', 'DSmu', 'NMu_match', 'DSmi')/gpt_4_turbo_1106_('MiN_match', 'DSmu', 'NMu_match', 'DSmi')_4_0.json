            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies uncertainty about the location of the cookies. It suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This statement is compatible with the idea that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" which means that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. So, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that there is no requirement for the cookies to be in the pantry. This implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, which is the same as saying \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" So, we can infer the third statement from the second.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" introduces uncertainty about the cookies being in the pantry but does not eliminate the possibility that they could be there. Since there is still a possibility that the cookies are in the pantry, we cannot definitively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be in the pantry.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
