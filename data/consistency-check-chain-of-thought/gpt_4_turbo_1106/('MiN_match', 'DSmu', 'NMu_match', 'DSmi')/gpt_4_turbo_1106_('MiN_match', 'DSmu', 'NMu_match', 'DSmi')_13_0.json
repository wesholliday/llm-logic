            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This means that it is not certain that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: If we know that \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and it is also true that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original either/or statement is that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that there is no certainty that the milk is chilling in the fridge. This allows for the possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge; it only suggests that there is a possibility that it is not. Since the certainty of the milk's location is not established by \"might not,\" we cannot definitively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
