            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control. The inference \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty that the remote control is under the couch. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it is consistent with the idea that it is not certain to be there. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is no certainty that the remote control is under the couch. This is equivalent to saying that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, which is what \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be there. Since there is still a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be under the couch. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
