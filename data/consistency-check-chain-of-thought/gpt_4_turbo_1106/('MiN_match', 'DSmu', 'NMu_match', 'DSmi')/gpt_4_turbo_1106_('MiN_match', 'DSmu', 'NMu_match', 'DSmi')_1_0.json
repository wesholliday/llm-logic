            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies uncertainty about the location of the book. It suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, it aligns with the second statement that the book's presence on the table is not a certainty. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, which is what \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests. Therefore, we can infer the third statement from the second.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces uncertainty about the book's location but does not eliminate the possibility that the book could be on the table. Since the possibility still exists that the book could be on the table, we cannot definitively infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nNow, I will provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
