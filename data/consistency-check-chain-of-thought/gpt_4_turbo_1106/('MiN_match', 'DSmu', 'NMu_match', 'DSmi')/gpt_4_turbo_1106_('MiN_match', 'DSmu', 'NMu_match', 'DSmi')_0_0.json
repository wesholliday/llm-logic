            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This means that it is not certain that Fido is in the garden. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" then the only other option from the disjunction that can be true is \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This allows for the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden, as \"must\" implies a requirement that is not met. Therefore, we can infer \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" introduces a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Since \"might not\" does not provide certainty, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nNow, I will provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
