            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second premise negates one of the disjuncts. If it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then by the process of elimination, the milk must be on the counter. So, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not necessarily mean that it must not be chilling in the fridge. \"Might not\" indicates uncertainty, but it does not confirm the absence of the milk from the fridge with certainty. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because \"might not\" does not equate to \"must not.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility of the milk being in the fridge, we cannot conclude with certainty that the milk is on the counter based on these premises. The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive state of affairs.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
