            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the book to be on the table. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" would mean that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. The possibility that the book might not be on the table does not exclude the possibility that it could still be there. Therefore, we cannot infer that it must not be on the table just because it might not be.\n\nQuestion 3: The first premise is the same as in Question 1, presenting a disjunction. The second premise, \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" introduces uncertainty about the location of the book but does not definitively exclude the possibility that the book is on the table. Since the second premise does not provide a definite negation of the book being on the table, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf based solely on the possibility that it might not be on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
