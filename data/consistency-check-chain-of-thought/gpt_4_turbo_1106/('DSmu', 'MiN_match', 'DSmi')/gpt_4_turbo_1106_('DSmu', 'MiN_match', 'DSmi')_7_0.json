            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that since it is not the case that the remote must be under the couch, the only other option presented is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premise is:\n- \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, it does not categorically state that it must not be under the couch. The possibility (might not be) does not exclude other possibilities. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" because the original statement allows for the possibility but does not confirm it. Hence, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe second premise introduces uncertainty about the location of the remote control. It does not definitively exclude the possibility that the remote control could be under the couch; it just states that it might not be. Because there is no certainty provided by the second premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to the third question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
