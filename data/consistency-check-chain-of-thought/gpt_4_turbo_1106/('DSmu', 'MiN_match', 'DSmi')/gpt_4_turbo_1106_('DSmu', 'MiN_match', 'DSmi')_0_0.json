            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. \"Might not be\" indicates uncertainty and does not exclude the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" solely from the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The first premise is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" and the second premise is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise introduces the possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm it as a fact. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Fido is inside\" based on these premises. The possibility remains that Fido could be in the garden or somewhere else not mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
