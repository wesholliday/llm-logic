            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement presents a dichotomy: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf but does not eliminate the possibility. Since the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf is not ruled out, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The first statement again presents a dichotomy. The second statement, however, asserts that it is not true that the toy must be on the bookshelf, which effectively rules out the bookshelf as a possibility. Since the toy must be in one of the two places, and it cannot be on the bookshelf, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not equate to 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf', which would imply that the toy definitely cannot be on the bookshelf. The original statement allows for the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf, so we cannot infer the stronger statement.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' indicates that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which is what 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' suggests. Therefore, we can infer that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
