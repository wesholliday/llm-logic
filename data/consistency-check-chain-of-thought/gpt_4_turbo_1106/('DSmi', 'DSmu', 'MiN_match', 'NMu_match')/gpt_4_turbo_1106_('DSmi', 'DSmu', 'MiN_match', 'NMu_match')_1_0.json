            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first premise is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" which is an inclusive or statement, meaning that one or both conditions could be true. The second premise is \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" which suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could be on the table. Since there is still a possibility that the book is on the table, we cannot definitively infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The first premise remains the same, and the second premise is now \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which means that the book definitely is not resting on the table. Since the book must be in one of the two locations mentioned, and it has been established that it is not on the table, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies uncertainty about the location of the book. It does not assert that the book must not be on the table, only that it's possible that it is not. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" is a definitive statement that the book cannot be resting on the table as a necessity. The first statement does not necessarily lead to the second because the possibility does not exclude the necessity. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table, which implies that there is at least a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" Hence, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
