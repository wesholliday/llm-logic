            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first premise is a logical disjunction (either/or statement), and the second premise introduces a possibility that the remote control might not be under the couch. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The first premise is the same as in Question 1, but the second premise now states that it is not the case that the remote must be hiding under the couch, which negates the necessity of it being under the couch. This means that the only remaining possibility from the original either/or statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the location of the remote control but does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be under the couch. It does not assert that it must not be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" because the original statement allows for the possibility that it might still be there.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" asserts that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
