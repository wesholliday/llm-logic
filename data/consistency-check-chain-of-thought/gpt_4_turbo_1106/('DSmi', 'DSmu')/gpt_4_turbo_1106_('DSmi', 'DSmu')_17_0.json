    "system_prompt": "You will see a series of 2 yes/no questions. Think step by step about each question and explain your reasoning. Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas. The first answer is for the first question, the second answer is for the second question, etc. Each answer should be either 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "To answer these questions, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the second condition (the notebook being on the nightstand), but it does not definitively exclude the possibility. Since the second statement does not confirm that the notebook is definitely not on the nightstand, we cannot infer with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer. It might be in the drawer, or it might still be on the nightstand.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, the first statement is a logical disjunction. The second statement, however, is stronger than in Question 1. It negates the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand, which means it cannot be on the nightstand. Since the disjunction must be true and the second condition (the notebook being on the nightstand) is negated, we are left with the only other possibility presented in the disjunction: the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
