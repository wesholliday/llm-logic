            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be there. Since this statement does not definitively exclude the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" definitively excludes the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry. Since the cookies must be in one of the two places mentioned, and they cannot be in the pantry, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
