            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement presents a disjunction: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second statement introduces a possibility that the toy might not be on the bookshelf. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf, because \"might not be\" is not a definitive statement. It suggests uncertainty rather than certainty that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, the first statement presents a disjunction: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second statement, however, is more definitive this time. It states that \"it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which negates the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf as a necessity. If it must not be on the bookshelf, then the only remaining option from the original disjunction is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
