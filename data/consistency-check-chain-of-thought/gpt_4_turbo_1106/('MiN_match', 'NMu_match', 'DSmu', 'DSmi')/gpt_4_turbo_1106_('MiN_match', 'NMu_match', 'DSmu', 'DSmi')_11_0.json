            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. This means that it is not certain that the jacket is hanging in the closet. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" because \"must\" implies necessity, which is contradicted by the possibility that the jacket might not be there.\n\nQuestion 2: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet. This does not necessarily imply that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, as the jacket could still be there without it being a must. However, it does allow for the possibility that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" then the necessity of the jacket being in the closet is ruled out. Since the disjunction states that one of the two conditions must be true, and we know the second condition (necessity of being in the closet) is false, it must be the case that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" introduces uncertainty about the jacket being in the closet but does not rule it out completely. Because there is still a possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet (even if it's not a must), we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based on this information alone.\n\nNow, I will provide the answers to all four questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
