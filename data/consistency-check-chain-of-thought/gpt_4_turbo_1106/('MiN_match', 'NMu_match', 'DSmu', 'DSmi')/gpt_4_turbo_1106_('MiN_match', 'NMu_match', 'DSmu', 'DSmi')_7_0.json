            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control, but it does not confirm that the remote control is definitely not under the couch. However, the inference \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" is a statement that negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch. This inference is valid because if there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, then it cannot be the case that it must be there.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. From this, we can infer that there is at least a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, which aligns with the statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be. Since there is no certainty provided by this additional information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
