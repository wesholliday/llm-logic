            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This statement suggests that it is not certain that the cookies are in the pantry. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" because \"must\" implies necessity, and the original statement allows for the possibility that the cookies are not there.\n\nQuestion 2: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that it is not necessary for the cookies to be in the pantry. This does not necessarily imply that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" because the absence of necessity does not automatically imply possibility. However, in common usage, if something is not necessarily true, it often implies that there is a possibility of it not being true. So, in this context, we can infer that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" then the disjunction forces the other part of the statement to be true, which is \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" does not provide definitive information about the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry; it only suggests a possibility. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the second part of the disjunction, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
