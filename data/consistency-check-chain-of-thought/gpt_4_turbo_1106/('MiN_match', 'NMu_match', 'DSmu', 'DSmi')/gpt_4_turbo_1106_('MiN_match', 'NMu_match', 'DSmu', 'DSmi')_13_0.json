            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This means that it is not certain that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that we cannot be certain that the milk is chilling in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, just that it is not a certainty. From this statement, we can infer that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, so \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" is a valid inference.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then the only other option given by the disjunction is that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the location of the milk but does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Because there is still a possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge, we cannot definitively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
