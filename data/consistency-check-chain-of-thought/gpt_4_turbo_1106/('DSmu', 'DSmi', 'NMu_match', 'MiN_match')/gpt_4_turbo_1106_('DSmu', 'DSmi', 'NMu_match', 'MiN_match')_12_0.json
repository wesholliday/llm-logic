            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot conclusively infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This statement implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf, which means it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This statement indicates a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not assert that the toy must not be on the bookshelf. It leaves open the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because the toy still might be there as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
