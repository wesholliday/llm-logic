            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and the second premise eliminates the possibility of the jacket hanging in the closet, we can infer that the jacket must be draped over the chair. So the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 2: The first premise is the same as in Question 1, but the second premise is different: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This second premise suggests a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not definitively exclude the closet as an option. Because it's not a definitive negation of the jacket hanging in the closet, we cannot infer with certainty that the jacket is draped over the chair. So the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" This means that it is not a necessity for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. From this, we can infer that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, which is what \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests. So the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This indicates uncertainty about the location of the jacket but does not definitively rule out that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. It allows for the possibility that the jacket could be hanging in the closet or not. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which would require a definitive negation of the necessity. So the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
