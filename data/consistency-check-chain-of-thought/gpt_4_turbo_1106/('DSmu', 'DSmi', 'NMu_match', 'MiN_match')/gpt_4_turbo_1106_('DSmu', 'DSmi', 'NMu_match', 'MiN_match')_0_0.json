            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Since it's not a definitive negation of the second part of the disjunction, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on these premises.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This statement negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, which implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This indicates a possibility but does not assert certainty. It does not negate the necessity that Fido must be in the garden; it only suggests that there is a chance he is not. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because the necessity could still exist alongside the possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
