            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a statement that says the sunglasses are either in her bag or they must be perched on her head. We also have a second statement that negates the possibility that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. If it's not possible that they must be on her head, then the only remaining option from the initial statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' introduces uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses. It does not definitively rule out that the sunglasses could be on her head; it just suggests that it's a possibility they are not. Since there is still a possibility that the sunglasses are on her head, we cannot definitively infer that they are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 3: If it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then it is possible that the sunglasses are not perched on her head. This means that the statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' is a reasonable inference because it aligns with the possibility that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head.\n\nQuestion 4: If the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, this implies that there is a possibility that they are not on her head. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that they must be perched on her head. The word \"might\" indicates a possibility but does not confirm the absence of necessity. Therefore, from the statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', we cannot definitively infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', because the latter requires a certainty that the former does not provide.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
