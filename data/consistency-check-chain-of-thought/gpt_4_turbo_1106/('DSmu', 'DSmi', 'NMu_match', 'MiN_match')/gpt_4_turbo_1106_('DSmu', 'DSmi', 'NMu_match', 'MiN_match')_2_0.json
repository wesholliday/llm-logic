            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement) and a negation of one of the disjuncts. The statement is \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet,\" and we also know \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" Since the second statement negates one of the possibilities, we are left with the other possibility being true. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" is again given, but this time it is combined with \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\" The phrase \"might not be\" indicates uncertainty, not a definitive negation. Because there is still a possibility that the keys could be dangling in the cabinet, we cannot definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer based on this uncertainty.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is a definitive statement that negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet. From this, we can infer that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, which means \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" is a valid inference.\n\nQuestion 4: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not definitively state that they are not there. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which would be a definitive statement about the necessity of the keys' location. Therefore, from the possibility that the keys might not be dangling, we cannot infer the definitive statement that they must not be dangling.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
