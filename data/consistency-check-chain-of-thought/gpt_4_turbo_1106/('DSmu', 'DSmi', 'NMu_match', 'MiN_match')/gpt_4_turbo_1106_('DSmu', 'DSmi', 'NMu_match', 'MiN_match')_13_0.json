            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement) and a negation of one of the disjuncts. The statement is \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" and we also know \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" Since the second statement negates one of the options, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is again given, but this time it is paired with \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The word \"might\" introduces uncertainty and does not definitively negate the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Since we cannot be certain that the milk is not in the fridge, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that we are certain the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. This allows for the possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, as it is not a requirement. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not assert this as a certainty. It does not exclude the possibility that the milk could be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because the milk still could be there as a possibility.\n\nNow, I will provide the answers to all four questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
