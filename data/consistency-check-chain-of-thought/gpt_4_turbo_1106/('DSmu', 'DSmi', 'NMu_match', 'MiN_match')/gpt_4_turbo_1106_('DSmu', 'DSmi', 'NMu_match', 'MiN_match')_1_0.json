            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" If it's not the case that the book must be on the table, then the only remaining option from the first premise is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Since we do not have a definitive statement that the book is not on the table, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. If it's not necessary that the book is on the table, then it is possible that the book might not be on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This indicates that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the book must be on the table in some contexts or situations. \"Might not\" is about possibility, not certainty. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that it is necessarily the case that the book must not be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
