            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise negates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be under the couch at all. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" is a stronger claim, indicating that it is not a necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. The first statement does not logically lead to the second because \"might not be\" does not exclude the possibility that it still could be, whereas \"must not be\" excludes the possibility entirely. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This logically leads to the conclusion that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" because if it must not be under the couch, then it is possible that it is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the third statement from the given information.\n\nQuestion 4: The premises are \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the location of the remote control but does not eliminate the possibility that it could be under the couch. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and the second premise does not definitively exclude one of the options, we cannot infer with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we cannot infer the fourth statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
