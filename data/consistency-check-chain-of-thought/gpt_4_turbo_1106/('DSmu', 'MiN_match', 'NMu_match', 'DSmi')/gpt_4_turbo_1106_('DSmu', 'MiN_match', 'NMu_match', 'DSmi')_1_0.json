            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction. If it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. \"Might not be\" indicates uncertainty and does not exclude the possibility that the book must be on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer the stronger statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" from the weaker statement \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This means that there is at least one possibility where the book is not on the table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" since \"might not be\" is compatible with the absence of necessity.\n\nQuestion 4: The premises are \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the book's location but does not definitively exclude the possibility that the book must be on the table. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the book resting on the table, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book is on the shelf. The possibility remains that the book could be on the table, despite the uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
