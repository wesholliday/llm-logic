            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates one of the options in the first premise, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not necessarily mean that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because \"might not be\" indicates uncertainty, not a definitive negation of the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden. This implies that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, which is what \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests. Therefore, we can infer the third statement from the given information.\n\nQuestion 4: The premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Since the second premise does not definitively negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based solely on these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
