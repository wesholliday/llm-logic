            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table but does not rule it out completely\u2014it suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it doesn't confirm it. Because the second premise does not definitively exclude the possibility of the book being on the table, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The premise \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not equate to \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The latter would mean that it is impossible for the book to be on the table, which is a stronger statement than the original premise. The original premise allows for the possibility that the book could be on the table, so we cannot infer the stronger negation.\n\nQuestion 3: This time, we have \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" combined with \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the book being on the table, which means the book does not have to be on the table. Since the first premise presents a disjunction and the second premise rules out one of the options, we can infer that the book must be in the other location mentioned in the disjunction, which is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes",
