            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude the possibility of Fido being in the garden, we cannot infer with certainty that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 2: The premise \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not logically equate to \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The word \"might\" suggests uncertainty, not a definitive negation of the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Therefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden. The answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: Here we have the same first premise as in Question 1, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" but the second premise is different: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This second premise definitively states that Fido does not have to be in the garden. Since the first premise presents a disjunction and the second premise eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden as a necessity, we can infer that the only remaining option from the disjunction is that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer to the third question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes",
