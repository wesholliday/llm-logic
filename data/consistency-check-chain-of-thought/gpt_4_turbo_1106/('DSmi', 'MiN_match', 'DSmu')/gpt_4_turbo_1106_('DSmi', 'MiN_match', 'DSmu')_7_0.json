            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise introduces uncertainty about the second condition but does not definitively exclude it. Since the second premise does not confirm that the remote control is definitely not under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not equate to a definitive statement that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty, not certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer the definitive negation of the remote control having to be under the couch. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: This time, we have the same first premise as in Question 1, but the second premise is different: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This premise negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and the second premise rules out one of the options, we can infer that the remote control must be in the remaining location, which is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes",
