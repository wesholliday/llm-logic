            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\" The first statement presents a dichotomy: the keys are either in one place or the other. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the keys being in the cabinet but does not rule it out completely. Since it's not certain that the keys are not in the cabinet, we cannot definitively conclude that they are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" because if there was a necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet, there wouldn't be a possibility of them not being there.\n\nQuestion 3: We have the statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" combined with \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" If it's not the case that the keys must be in the cabinet, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
