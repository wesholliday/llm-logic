            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means that it is not certain that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: If we have the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and we also know \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original either/or statement is that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Since the option of the toy necessarily being on the bookshelf is ruled out, the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" combined with \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" does not allow us to definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" The reason is that \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not there. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box based on these statements.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This means that there is at least a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" since \"might not\" indicates the existence of a possibility that the toy is not there.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
