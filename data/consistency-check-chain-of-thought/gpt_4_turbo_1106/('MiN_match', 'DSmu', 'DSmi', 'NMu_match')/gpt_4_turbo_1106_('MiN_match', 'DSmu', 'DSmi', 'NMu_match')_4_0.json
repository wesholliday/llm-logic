            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This implies uncertainty about the location of the cookies. If it's not certain that the cookies are in the pantry, then it cannot be the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, because \"must\" implies certainty or necessity. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 2: We have two premises here: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" Since the second premise negates one of the options in the first premise (that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry), we are left with the only other option presented, which is that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" does not eliminate the possibility that the cookies are hidden in the pantry; it only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not. Since this does not provide certainty that the cookies are not in the pantry, we cannot definitively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\" based solely on these two statements.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" indicates that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
