            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because \"must\" indicates necessity, and the original statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not there.\n\nQuestion 2: If we know that \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and we also know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then by elimination, the remote control has to be on the coffee table. Since the only other option provided by the first statement has been negated, the remaining option must be true.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch; it merely suggests that it might not be there. Since there is no certainty provided by the second statement, we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This inherently means that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, which is the same as saying \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
