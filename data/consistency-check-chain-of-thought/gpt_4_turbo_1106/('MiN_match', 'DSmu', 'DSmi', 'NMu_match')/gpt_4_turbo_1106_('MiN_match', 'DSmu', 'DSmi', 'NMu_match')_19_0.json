            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This means that it is not certain they are on her head. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: If we know that \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and it is also true that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original either/or statement is that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\" This is a logical inference based on the process of elimination.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be perched on her head; it just indicates that there is uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" because the possibility that they might be perched on her head still exists.\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
