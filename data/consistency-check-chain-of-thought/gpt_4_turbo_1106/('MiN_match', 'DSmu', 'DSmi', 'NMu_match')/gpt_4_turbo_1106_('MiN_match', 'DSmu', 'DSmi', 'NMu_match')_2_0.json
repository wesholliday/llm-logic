            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This implies uncertainty about the location of the keys. The inference \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not a certainty that the keys are in the cabinet. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, it is consistent with the idea that their being there is not a certainty. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The keys are in the drawer.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" does not eliminate the possibility that the keys are dangling in the cabinet; it only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not. Since there is no certainty provided about the location of the keys, we cannot definitively infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be in the cabinet.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" indicates that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
