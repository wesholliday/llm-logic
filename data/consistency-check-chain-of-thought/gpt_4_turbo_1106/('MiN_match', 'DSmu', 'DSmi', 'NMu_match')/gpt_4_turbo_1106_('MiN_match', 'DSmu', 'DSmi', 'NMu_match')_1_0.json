            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This implies uncertainty about the book's location. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, it aligns with the second statement that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a logical disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. If we know that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" then the condition that the book must be on the table is false. Since one of the two conditions must be true and it's not the second one, it must be the first one. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents a disjunction. However, \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does not provide a definitive statement about the book not being on the table; it only suggests a possibility. Because it does not definitively negate the second condition, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on the possibility that the book might not be on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
