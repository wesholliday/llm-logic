            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" The first premise presents two possibilities, one of which must be true. The second premise suggests that it's possible the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could be hanging there. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude the jacket being in the closet, we cannot infer with certainty that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. This does not necessarily mean that the jacket cannot be hanging there; it just means that there is no requirement for it to be so. From this, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" since the possibility is open.\n\nQuestion 3: Here we have \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" combined with \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet, leaving us with the only other option presented in the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" indicates that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the jacket to be hanging there. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" would mean that there is no obligation or necessity for the jacket to be in the closet, which is a stronger statement than just saying it might not be there. Therefore, from the possibility that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, we cannot infer that it must not be hanging in the closet.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
