            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" The first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement suggests that the second possibility is not certain. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the cookies are in the pantry; it just indicates uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This means that it is possible that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 3: We have two statements: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" If it is not the case that the cookies must be in the pantry, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" expresses a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is certain that the cookies are not in the pantry. \"Might not be\" is about possibility, not certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" which would imply certainty that the cookies are not there.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
