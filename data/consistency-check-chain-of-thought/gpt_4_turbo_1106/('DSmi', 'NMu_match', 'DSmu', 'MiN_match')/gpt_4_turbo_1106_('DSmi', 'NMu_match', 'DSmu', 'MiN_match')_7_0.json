            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that it is not a certainty that the remote is under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 3: Here we have \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" combined with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" If it is not the case that the remote must be under the couch, then the only other option presented in the first premise is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not assert this with certainty. It does not exclude the possibility that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
