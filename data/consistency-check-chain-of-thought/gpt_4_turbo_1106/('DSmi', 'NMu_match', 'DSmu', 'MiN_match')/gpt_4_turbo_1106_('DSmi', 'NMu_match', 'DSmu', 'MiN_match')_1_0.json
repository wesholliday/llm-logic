            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This does not necessarily mean that the book might not be on the table, as it could still be there by chance. However, it does imply that there is no requirement or certainty that the book is on the table, which aligns with the idea that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" So, we can infer this statement.\n\nQuestion 3: Here we have \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" combined with \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving us with the only remaining option from the first premise that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not assert this as a certainty. It does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the book to be on the table. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which would imply that there is no possibility of the book being on the table.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
