            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Since the second premise does not definitively exclude Fido being in the garden, we cannot infer with certainty that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. This does not mean that Fido is definitely not in the garden, but rather that there is no necessity for Fido to be there. This allows for the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: We have two premises again: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, leaving us with the only other option presented in the first premise, which is that Fido is inside. Since the garden option is ruled out, we can infer that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for Fido to be in the garden. The statement does not negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden; it only suggests that there is a chance that Fido is not there. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" based solely on the possibility that Fido might not be there. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
