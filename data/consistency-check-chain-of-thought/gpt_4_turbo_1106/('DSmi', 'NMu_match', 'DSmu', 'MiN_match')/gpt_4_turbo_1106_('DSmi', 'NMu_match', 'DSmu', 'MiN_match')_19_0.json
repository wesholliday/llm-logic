            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be on her head. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag because the second premise does not rule out the other option completely.\n\nQuestion 2: The premise \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" indicates that it is not a certainty that the sunglasses are on her head. This allows for the possibility that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. So, yes, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 3: Here we have \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" combined with \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head, leaving us with the only other option presented by the first premise, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses. It does not assert that the sunglasses are definitely not on her head, just that there is a possibility they are not. However, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that there is no requirement for the sunglasses to be on her head. The possibility that they might not be perched on her head does imply that they don't have to be, so we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
