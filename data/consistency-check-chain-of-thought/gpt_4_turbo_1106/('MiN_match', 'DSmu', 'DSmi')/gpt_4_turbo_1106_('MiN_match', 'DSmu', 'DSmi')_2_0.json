            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This implies uncertainty about the location of the keys. If it's possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then it cannot be the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, because \"must\" implies certainty or necessity. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The keys are in the drawer.\" Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" does not eliminate the possibility that the keys are dangling in the cabinet; it only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not. Since there is no certainty provided by this additional statement, we cannot definitively infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
