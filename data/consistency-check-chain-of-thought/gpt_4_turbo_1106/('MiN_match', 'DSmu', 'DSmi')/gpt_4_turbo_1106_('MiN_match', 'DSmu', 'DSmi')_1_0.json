            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This implies uncertainty about the location of the book. From this statement, we can infer that it is not certain that the book is on the table, which means \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" So the answer to the first question is yes.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a statement of two possibilities, one of which must be true. If we know that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. So the answer to the second question is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. However, \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does not eliminate the possibility that the book is on the table; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Since we do not have definitive information that the book is not on the table, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on the given statements. So the answer to the third question is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
