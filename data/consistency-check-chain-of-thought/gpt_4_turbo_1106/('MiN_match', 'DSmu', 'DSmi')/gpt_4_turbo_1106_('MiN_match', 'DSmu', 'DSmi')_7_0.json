            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control. The inference \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty that the remote control is under the couch. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the inference that it is not a given fact that the remote control is under the couch. Therefore, the answer to the first question is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Therefore, the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be. Since there is still a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Therefore, the answer to the third question is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
