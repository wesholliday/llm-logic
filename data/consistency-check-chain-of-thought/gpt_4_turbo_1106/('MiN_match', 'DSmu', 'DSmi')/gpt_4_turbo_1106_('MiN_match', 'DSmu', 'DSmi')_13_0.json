            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This implies uncertainty about the milk's location. The inference \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not a certainty that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, it supports the inference that it is not a certainty (or a must) that the milk is chilling in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, if the milk must not be chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the milk being in the fridge but does not eliminate the possibility that it could be chilling in the fridge. Since there is still a possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
