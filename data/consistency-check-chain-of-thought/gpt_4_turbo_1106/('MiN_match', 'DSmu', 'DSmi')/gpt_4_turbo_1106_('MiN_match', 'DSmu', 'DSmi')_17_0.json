            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This means that it is not certain that the notebook is on the nightstand. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: If we have the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand,\" and we also know \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" then we are left with only one possibility from the original statement: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" Since the other option (that the notebook must be on the nightstand) has been negated, the remaining option must be true.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" does not eliminate the possibility that the notebook is on the nightstand; it only suggests that there is a possibility that it is not. Since we do not have certainty that the notebook is not on the nightstand, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" There is still a possibility that the notebook could be on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
