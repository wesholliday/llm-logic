            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This means that it is not certain that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the keys are in the drawer because \"might not\" implies a possibility, not a certainty. The keys could still be dangling in the cabinet or be somewhere else entirely; we just know that it's not a certainty that they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. If we add the information \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" we are left with the certainty that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet. Since the keys must be in one of the two places mentioned, and they cannot be in the cabinet, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
