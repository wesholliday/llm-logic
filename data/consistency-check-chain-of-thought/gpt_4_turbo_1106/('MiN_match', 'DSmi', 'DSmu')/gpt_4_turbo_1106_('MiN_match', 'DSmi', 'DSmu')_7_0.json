            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control. It does not confirm that the remote control is definitely not under the couch, but it does imply that it's not necessarily there. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we add the information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we are left with uncertainty about the second option. However, this uncertainty does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch, as \"might not\" does not equate to \"is not.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on these statements, because the possibility remains that the remote control could be in a location not mentioned or still under the couch despite the uncertainty.\n\nQuestion 3: This time, we have the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" combined with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The second statement negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch, leaving us with the only other presented option: the remote control is on the coffee table. Since the necessity of the remote being under the couch is refuted, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
