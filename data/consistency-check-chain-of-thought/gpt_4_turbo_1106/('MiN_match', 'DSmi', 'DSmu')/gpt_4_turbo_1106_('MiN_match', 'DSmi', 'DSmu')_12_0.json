            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means that it is not certain that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. When we add the information \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we are faced with uncertainty about the second option. However, because the second option is not definitively ruled out (it is still possible, even if not certain), we cannot conclude with certainty that the toy is in the toy box. There is still a possibility, however slight, that the toy could be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 3: This time, the statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" definitively rules out the certainty of the toy being on the bookshelf. Since the original statement was \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" and we know that it is not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
