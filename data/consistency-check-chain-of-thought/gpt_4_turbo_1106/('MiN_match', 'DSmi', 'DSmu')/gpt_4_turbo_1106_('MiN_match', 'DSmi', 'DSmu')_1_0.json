            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This implies uncertainty about the book's location. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, it is consistent with the second statement that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. When combined with the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we are faced with uncertainty about the second option (the book being on the table). However, the uncertainty of the second option does not confirm the first option (the book being on the shelf) because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving us with the only remaining possibility that the book is on the shelf. Since the second option is negated as a necessity, the first option becomes the only viable one. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
