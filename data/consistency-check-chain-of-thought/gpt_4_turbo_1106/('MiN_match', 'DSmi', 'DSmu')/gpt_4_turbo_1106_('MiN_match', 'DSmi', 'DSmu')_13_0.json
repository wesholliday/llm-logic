            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This implies uncertainty about the location of the milk. The inference \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not a certainty that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, it supports the inference that it is not a certainty (or a must) that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not confirm it as false. Since there is still a possibility that the milk could be chilling in the fridge (even though it might not be), we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based solely on the information given. Therefore, the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge, leaving the only other possibility presented in the original statement. If it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then the milk must be on the counter, according to the original statement. Therefore, the answer to the third question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
