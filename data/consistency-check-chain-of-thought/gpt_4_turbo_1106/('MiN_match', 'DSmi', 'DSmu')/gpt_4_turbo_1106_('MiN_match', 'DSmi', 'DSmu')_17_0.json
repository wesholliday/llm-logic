            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This implies uncertainty about the location of the notebook. The phrase \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" means that it is not a certainty or requirement that the notebook is on the nightstand. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, it aligns with the second statement that it is not a certainty. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. When combined with the statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand,\" we are faced with uncertainty about the second option (the notebook being on the nightstand). However, the uncertainty of the notebook's location on the nightstand does not eliminate the possibility that it could be there; it simply means it's not certain. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer just because it might not be on the nightstand.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, we have the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This time it is combined with \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" which negates the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand. If it is not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand, and these are the only two options presented, then the notebook must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
