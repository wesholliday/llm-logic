            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This implies uncertainty about the state of the milk. If it's not certain that the milk is chilling, then it cannot be the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, because \"must\" implies certainty. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we are dealing with a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, but this does not eliminate the possibility that it could be chilling in the fridge. Since we do not have certainty that the milk is not in the fridge, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two exclusive possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" we have a definitive statement that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. Since the milk must not be chilling in the fridge, the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that there is no certainty or requirement that the milk is chilling in the fridge. This allows for the possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
