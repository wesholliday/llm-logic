            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This implies uncertainty about the location of the keys. The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not a certainty that the keys are in the cabinet. Both statements agree that there is no certainty about the keys being in the cabinet. Therefore, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. When combined with \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" we are left with uncertainty because \"might not\" does not eliminate the possibility that the keys are still dangling in the cabinet. It only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the second possibility, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3: When we combine \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" with \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" we have a definitive statement that the keys are not necessarily in the cabinet. This leaves only one possibility from the original statement, which is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" indicates that there is no requirement for the keys to be in the cabinet. This means that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
