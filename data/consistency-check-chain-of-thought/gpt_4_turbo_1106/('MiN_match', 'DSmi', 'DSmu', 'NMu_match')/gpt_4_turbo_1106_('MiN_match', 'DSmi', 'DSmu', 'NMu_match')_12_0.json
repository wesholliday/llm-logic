            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means that it is not certain that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the toy is in the toy box because \"might not\" implies a possibility, not a certainty. The toy could still be on the bookshelf or somewhere else not mentioned in the options provided.\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" this means that the toy is definitely not required to be on the bookshelf. Given the initial condition \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" and knowing that the latter is not true, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This allows for the possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
