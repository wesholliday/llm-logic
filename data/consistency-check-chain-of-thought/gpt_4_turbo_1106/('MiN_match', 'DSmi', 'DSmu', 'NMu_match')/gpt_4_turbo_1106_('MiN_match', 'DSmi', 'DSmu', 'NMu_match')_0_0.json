            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This implies uncertainty about Fido's location. If it's not certain that Fido is in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden, because \"must\" implies certainty or necessity. Therefore, from the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" this introduces uncertainty about the second option. However, the uncertainty of Fido being in the garden does not eliminate the possibility that he must be in the garden, as \"might not\" does not equate to \"is not.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on these two statements, because the possibility that Fido must be in the garden has not been ruled out.\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and also that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can eliminate the second option because it is explicitly stated that Fido does not have to be in the garden. With the second option invalidated, the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" directly negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden. This means that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. If there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, then it is true that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" from the statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
