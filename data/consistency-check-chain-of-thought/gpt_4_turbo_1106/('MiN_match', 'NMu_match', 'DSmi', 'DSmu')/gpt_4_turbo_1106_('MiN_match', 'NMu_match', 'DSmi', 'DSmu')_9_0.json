            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" implies that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed. This means that it is not certain that the sock is under the bed. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" means that there is no certainty that the sock is under the bed. This does not necessarily imply that the sock might not be under the bed, as the sock could still be under the bed without it being a certainty. However, it does allow for the possibility that the sock might not be under the bed. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we also know that \"The missing sock might not be under the bed,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the sock is in the laundry basket because \"might not\" does not eliminate the possibility that the sock could still be under the bed. It only suggests that it's not certain to be there.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" combined with \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" allows us to infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. Since it's established that the sock definitely isn't under the bed (as per the second statement), the only remaining option from the first statement is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
