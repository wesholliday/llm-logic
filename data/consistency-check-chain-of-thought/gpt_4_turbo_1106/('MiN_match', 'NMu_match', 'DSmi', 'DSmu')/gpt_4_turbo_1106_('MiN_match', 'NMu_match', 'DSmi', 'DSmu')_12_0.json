            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means that it is not certain that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, as the toy could still be there by chance. However, it does allow for the possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is a logical disjunction that presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The toy is in the toy box\" because \"might not\" implies a possibility, not a certainty. The toy could still be on the bookshelf, just not necessarily so.\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and also that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we can conclude that the toy must be in the toy box. Since the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is negated, the only remaining possibility presented by the disjunction is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
