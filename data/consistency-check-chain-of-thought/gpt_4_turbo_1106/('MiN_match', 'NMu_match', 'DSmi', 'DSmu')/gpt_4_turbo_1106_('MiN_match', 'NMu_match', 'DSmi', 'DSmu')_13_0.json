            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies uncertainty about the milk's location. It suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. Therefore, it is true that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by \"might not.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" indicates that there is no certainty that the milk is chilling in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not chilling in the fridge; it could still be chilling there, but it's not a must. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" because the possibility is left open.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we also know that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we cannot definitively conclude that \"The milk is on the counter\" because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the milk could still be chilling in the fridge. It only suggests that there is a possibility that it is not.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" combined with \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" allows us to infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Since it is not a must that the milk is chilling in the fridge, and those are the only two options presented, the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
