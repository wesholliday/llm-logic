            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" does not definitively exclude the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry; it only suggests that it's not certain they are there. Since we don't have a definitive exclusion of the pantry as a possibility, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" which would imply that it's impossible for the cookies to be in the pantry. The original statement only suggests uncertainty, not impossibility.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that it is not a necessity that the cookies are in the pantry. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and it is also true that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" then we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar. Since the possibility of the cookies necessarily being in the pantry is excluded, the only remaining option from the original statement is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
