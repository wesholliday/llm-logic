            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely. Since \"might not\" does not mean \"definitely not,\" we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which would imply a certainty that the keys are not dangling there. \"Might not\" indicates uncertainty, not a definitive negation. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is no necessity for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet. This allows for the possibility that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" from this statement. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" eliminates the necessity of the second possibility, leaving us with only one possibility: the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer. The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
