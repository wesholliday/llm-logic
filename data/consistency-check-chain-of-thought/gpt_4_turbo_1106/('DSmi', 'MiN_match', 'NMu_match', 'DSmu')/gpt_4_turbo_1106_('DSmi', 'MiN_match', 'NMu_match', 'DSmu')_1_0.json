            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does not definitively exclude the possibility of the book being on the table; it only suggests that it's possible that the book is not on the table. Since we do not have a definite exclusion of the book being on the table, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which would imply that the book definitely cannot be on the table. The original statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that the book is not necessarily on the table, which is equivalent to saying \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" So, from the given statement, we can infer that it is possible that the book is not on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and it is also true that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" then we can infer that the book must be on the shelf. Since the possibility of the book having to be on the table is negated, the only remaining option from the original either/or statement is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
