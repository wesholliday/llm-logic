            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The first statement presents a disjunction: the remote control is either on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. The second statement introduces a possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch, as \"might not be\" is not a definitive statement. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch' suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This does not equate to a definitive statement that it must not be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch' based solely on the possibility that it might not be.\n\nQuestion 3: If it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, this means that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This allows for the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch'.\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' and it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then by elimination, the remote control must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
