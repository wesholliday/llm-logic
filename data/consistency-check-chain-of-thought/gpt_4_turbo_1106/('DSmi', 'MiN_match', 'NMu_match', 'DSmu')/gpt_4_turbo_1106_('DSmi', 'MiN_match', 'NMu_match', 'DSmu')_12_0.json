            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely. Since \"might not\" does not mean \"is not,\" we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means that it is not necessarily the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. So, we can infer that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" indicates that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" eliminates the necessity of the second possibility, leaving us with only one possibility: the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
