            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be on her head. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag because the second premise does not rule out the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head completely.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" which would be a definitive statement that the sunglasses cannot be on her head. \"Might not be\" indicates uncertainty, not certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: If it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then it is possible that they are not on her head. This aligns with the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" which acknowledges the possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. So, yes, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head from the statement that it's not the case that they must be perched on her head.\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then by elimination, the sunglasses must be in her bag. The second premise rules out one of the disjunctive options, leaving us with the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
