            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden, but it does allow for the possibility that Fido might not be there. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This is different from saying \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which denies the necessity of Fido being in the garden but does not confirm his actual location. However, if Fido might not be in the garden, it implies that there is no necessity for him to be there, so we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden; it only suggests that it is not certain. Since we cannot be sure that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden.\n\nNow, I will provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
