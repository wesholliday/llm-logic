            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not exclude the possibility that it could be there. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because \"might not be\" does not equate to \"must not be.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could be under the couch, as \"might not be\" is not definitive. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be under the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
