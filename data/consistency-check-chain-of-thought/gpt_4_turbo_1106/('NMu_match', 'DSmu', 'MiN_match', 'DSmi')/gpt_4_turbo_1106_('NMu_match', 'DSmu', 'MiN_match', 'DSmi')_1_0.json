            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This allows for the possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. So, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" then the only other option from the disjunction that can be true is \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies uncertainty about the location of the book. It suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which denies the necessity of the book being on the table. So, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents a logical disjunction. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could be on the table. Because it does not definitively exclude the possibility of the book being on the table, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The book is on the shelf.\" There is still a possibility, however slight, that the book could be on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
