            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not in the fridge, just that it is not required to be there. Therefore, it is possible that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. So, we can infer \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then the only other option given by the disjunction is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This statement does not assert that the milk must not be in the fridge, just that it is possible that it is not. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which denies the necessity of the milk being in the fridge. So, we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the milk's location but does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is in the fridge. Since the possibility of the milk chilling in the fridge is not ruled out, we cannot definitively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
