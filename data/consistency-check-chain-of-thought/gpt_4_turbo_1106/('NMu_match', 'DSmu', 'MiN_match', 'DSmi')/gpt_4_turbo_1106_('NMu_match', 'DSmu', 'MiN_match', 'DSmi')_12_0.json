            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This means that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is a logical disjunction. If we know that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" then the only other option from the disjunction that can be true is \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not exclude the possibility that the toy could be on the bookshelf. It does not assert necessity either way. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because the toy still might be there by chance.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents a disjunction. The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces uncertainty about the toy's location but does not confirm that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Since there is no certainty that the toy is not on the bookshelf, we cannot conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
