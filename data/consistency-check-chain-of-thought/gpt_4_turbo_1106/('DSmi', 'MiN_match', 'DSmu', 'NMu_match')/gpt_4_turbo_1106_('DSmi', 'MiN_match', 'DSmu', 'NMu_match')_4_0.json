            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" The first premise presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario), and the second suggests a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the cookies could still be in the pantry. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\" because the second premise does not rule out the pantry as a possibility completely.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not equate to \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" which would imply that it is impossible for the cookies to be in the pantry. \"Might not be\" indicates uncertainty, not certainty, so we cannot infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nQuestion 3: If we combine \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" with \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" we are left with only one option: the cookies must be in the jar. The second premise rules out the pantry as a must, leaving the jar as the only remaining possibility.\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This logically implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, which is what \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests. Therefore, we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
