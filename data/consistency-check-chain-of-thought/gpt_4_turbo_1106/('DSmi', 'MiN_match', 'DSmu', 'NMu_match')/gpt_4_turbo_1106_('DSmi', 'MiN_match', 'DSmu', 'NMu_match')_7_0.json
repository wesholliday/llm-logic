            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty but does not definitively eliminate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch. Since we do not have a definitive exclusion of the second possibility, we cannot conclusively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not equate to \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would imply that it is impossible for the remote control to be under the couch. The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty, not certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: If \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" this means that the remote control being under the couch is not a necessity. Given the initial statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch,\" and knowing that it is not a must for the remote to be under the couch, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This logically implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, which is the same as saying \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
