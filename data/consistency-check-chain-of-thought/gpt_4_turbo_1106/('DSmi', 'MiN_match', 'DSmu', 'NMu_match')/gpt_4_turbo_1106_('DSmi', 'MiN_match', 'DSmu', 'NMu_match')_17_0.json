            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" does not eliminate the possibility that the notebook is on the nightstand; it just suggests that it's not certain. Since we don't have definitive proof that the notebook is not on the nightstand, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies uncertainty about the location of the notebook on the nightstand. It does not assert that the notebook definitely isn't there. Therefore, it does not logically lead to the conclusion that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" which would imply that the notebook definitely cannot be on the nightstand. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" this means that the notebook definitely isn't on the nightstand. Given the initial statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand,\" and knowing that the latter is not true, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: If \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" this means that there is no necessity for the notebook to be on the nightstand. This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which is equivalent to saying \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\" The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
