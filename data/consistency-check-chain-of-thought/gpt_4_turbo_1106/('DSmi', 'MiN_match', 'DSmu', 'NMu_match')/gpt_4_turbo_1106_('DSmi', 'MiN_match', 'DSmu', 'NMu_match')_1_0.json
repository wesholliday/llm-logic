            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table. Since we cannot be certain that the book is not on the table, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" with absolute certainty.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This does not equate to a definitive statement that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which would imply that the book cannot be on the table. The original statement allows for the possibility but does not confirm it as a fact. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first with certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: If we know that \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and it's also true that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" then we can infer that the book must be on the shelf. The second premise eliminates the possibility of the book being on the table, leaving the only other option presented by the first premise, which is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" indicates that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This does not necessarily mean that the book is not on the table, but it does mean that there is a possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
