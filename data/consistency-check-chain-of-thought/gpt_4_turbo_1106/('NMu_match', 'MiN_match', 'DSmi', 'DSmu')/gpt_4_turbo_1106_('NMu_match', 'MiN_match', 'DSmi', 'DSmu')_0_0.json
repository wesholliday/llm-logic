            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden, but it allows for the possibility that Fido might not be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This does not directly imply that Fido is definitely not required to be in the garden; it only acknowledges the possibility of his absence. However, if Fido might not be in the garden, it means that it is not certain that he must be there. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that Fido is inside because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on these two statements.\n\nQuestion 4: If we have the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and we also know that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can conclude that the only remaining possibility from the original either/or statement is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
