            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not in the fridge, just that it is not required to be there. Therefore, it is possible that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. So, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not exclude the possibility that the milk must be in the fridge (perhaps it is there because it must be kept cold). Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because the milk might still need to be there, even if it might not be.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a statement of two possibilities. When combined with \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is still in the fridge. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" combined with \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" allows us to infer that the milk is on the counter. If it is not the case that the milk must be in the fridge, then the only other given option is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
