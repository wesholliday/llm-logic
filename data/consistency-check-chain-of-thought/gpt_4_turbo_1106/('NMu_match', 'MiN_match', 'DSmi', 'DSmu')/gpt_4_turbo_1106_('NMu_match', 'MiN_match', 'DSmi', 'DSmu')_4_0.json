            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry. This means that it is not necessarily true that the cookies are in the pantry. From this, we can infer that there is a possibility that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. So the answer to the first question is 'yes'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. It simply acknowledges that there is uncertainty about the location of the cookies. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\". So the answer to the second question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. When combined with the statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\", we cannot conclude with certainty that the cookies are in the jar because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the cookies could still be in the pantry. It only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not in the pantry. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cookies are in the jar\". So the answer to the third question is 'no'.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. When combined with the statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\", we negate the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry, leaving us with the only remaining possibility presented by the original statement, which is that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\". So the answer to the fourth question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
