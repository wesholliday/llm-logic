            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is no necessity for the notebook to be on the nightstand. This statement allows for the possibility that the notebook might be somewhere else. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the notebook to be there. It simply acknowledges the possibility of the notebook being elsewhere. This statement does not preclude the notebook from being on the nightstand; it just doesn't confirm it as a must. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" is a statement of two possibilities, one of which must be true. When combined with \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand,\" we are left with uncertainty because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the notebook could still be on the nightstand. It does not confirm that the notebook is definitely not on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" combined with \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" tells us that the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand is negated. If it is not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand, and these are the only two options presented, then the notebook must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
