            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" implies that there is no certainty about the sock being under the bed. It does not necessarily mean the sock is not there, just that it's not a given. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The missing sock might not be under the bed,\" because the possibility is left open.\n\nQuestion 2: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed. This statement implies uncertainty about the location of the sock. If it might not be under the bed, then it is not a certainty that it must be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" is a statement of two possibilities. When combined with \"The missing sock might not be under the bed,\" we cannot definitively conclude that the sock is in the laundry basket because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility of the sock being under the bed; it only suggests that it's not certain to be there. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" combined with \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" allows us to infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. Since it must not be under the bed, the only remaining option presented is that it is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
