            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This allows for the possibility that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. So, from the given statement, we can infer that it is possible the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\nQuestion 2: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a certainty that they must not be there. It's a statement of possibility, not necessity. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that it is necessarily the case that the sunglasses must not be perched on her head.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" is a statement of two exclusive possibilities. When combined with \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" we cannot make a definitive inference that the sunglasses are in her bag because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be perched on her head. It only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" combined with \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" allows us to infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. Since it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head, and those are the only two options presented, they must be in the bag by process of elimination.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
