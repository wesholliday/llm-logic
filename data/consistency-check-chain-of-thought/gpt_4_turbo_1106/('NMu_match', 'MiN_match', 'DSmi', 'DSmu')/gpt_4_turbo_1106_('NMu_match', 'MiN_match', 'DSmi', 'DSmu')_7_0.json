            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control. It suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be under the couch. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because the remote control still might be there, just not necessarily so.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" with certainty.\n\nQuestion 4: If we have the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and we also know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then we can infer that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. Since the two options were mutually exclusive and one has been negated, the remote control must be in the location that has not been negated, which is the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
