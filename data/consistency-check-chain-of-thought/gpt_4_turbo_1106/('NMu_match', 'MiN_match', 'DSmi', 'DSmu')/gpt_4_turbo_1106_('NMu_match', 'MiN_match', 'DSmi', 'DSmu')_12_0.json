            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This means that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the toy to be there; it just acknowledges the possibility of the toy not being there. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because the toy still might be required to be there, despite the possibility of it not being there.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is a statement of two possibilities. When combined with \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot make a definitive inference that \"The toy is in the toy box\" because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf. It only acknowledges that there is a chance that the toy is not there.\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" combined with \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" allows us to infer that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. Since the toy must be in one of the two locations and it is not required to be on the bookshelf, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
