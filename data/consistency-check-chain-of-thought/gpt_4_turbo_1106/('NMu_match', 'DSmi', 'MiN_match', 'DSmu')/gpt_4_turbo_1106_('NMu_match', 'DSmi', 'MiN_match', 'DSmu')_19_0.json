            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This means that it is possible that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we know that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" we cannot definitively conclude that they are in her bag because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be on her head. It only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not on her head. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" indicates that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" which denies the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two exclusive options. If we know \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" then the necessity of them being on her head is removed, leaving us with the only other option presented, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
