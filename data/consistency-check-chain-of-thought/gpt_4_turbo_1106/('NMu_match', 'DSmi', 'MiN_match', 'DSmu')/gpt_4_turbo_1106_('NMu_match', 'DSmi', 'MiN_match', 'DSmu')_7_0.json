            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This allows for the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. So, the inference \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" is a valid one.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we add the information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch. It only suggests that it's a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which denies the necessity of the remote being under the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" from \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 4: If we know that \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and it is also true that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original either/or statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
