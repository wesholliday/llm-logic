            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 2: We have two premises: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the cookies being in the pantry but does not confirm their location. Since the first premise presents an either-or scenario and the second premise does not confirm that the cookies are definitely not in the pantry, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\" based solely on these premises.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" indicates that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This is consistent with the negation of necessity, which is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 4: We have two premises: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" If it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then by the process of elimination given the either-or scenario, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
