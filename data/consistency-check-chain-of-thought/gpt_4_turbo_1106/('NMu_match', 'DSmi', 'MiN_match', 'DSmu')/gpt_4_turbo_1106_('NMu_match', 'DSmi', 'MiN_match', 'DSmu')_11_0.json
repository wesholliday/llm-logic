            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet. This means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 2: We have two premises: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" The second premise introduces uncertainty about the jacket being in the closet but does not confirm its location. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and we cannot confirm the jacket is in the closet, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair based on the information given. There might be other possibilities not mentioned in the premises.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. This aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which denies the necessity of the jacket being in the closet. Therefore, from \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 4: We have two premises: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet, which leaves us with the only other option presented in the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
