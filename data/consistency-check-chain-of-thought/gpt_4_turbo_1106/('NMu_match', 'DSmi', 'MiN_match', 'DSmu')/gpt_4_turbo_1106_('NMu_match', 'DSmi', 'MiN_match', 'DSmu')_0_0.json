            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" suggests that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: We have two premises here: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise introduces the possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Since the first premise presents a dichotomy where Fido must be in one of two places (inside or in the garden), and the second premise suggests that being in the garden is not certain, we can infer that Fido might be inside. However, because \"might not be in the garden\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which denies the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Again, we have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, leaving the only other option from the first premise, which is that Fido is inside. Since the possibility of Fido being in the garden is ruled out, we can definitively infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
