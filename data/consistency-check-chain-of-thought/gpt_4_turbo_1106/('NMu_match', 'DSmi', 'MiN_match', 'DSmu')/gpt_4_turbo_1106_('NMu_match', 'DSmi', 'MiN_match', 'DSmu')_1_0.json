            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This allows for the possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. So, we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we know that \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The book is on the shelf\" because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which denies the necessity of the book being on the table. So, we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two exclusive options. If it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the necessity of the book being on the table is denied. This means that the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
