            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" implies that there is no certainty about the sock being under the bed. This allows for the possibility that the sock might not be under the bed. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The missing sock might not be under the bed,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the sock is in the laundry basket because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that it still could be under the bed. It only suggests that there is a possibility that it is not under the bed. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" implies that there is uncertainty about the location of the sock, and it could be somewhere other than under the bed. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" because \"must\" implies certainty, which is negated by \"might not be.\" Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" again presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" we are negating the second possibility, leaving us with only one possibility that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
