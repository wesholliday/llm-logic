            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is not in the fridge, just that it is not required to be there. Therefore, it is possible that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. So, the inference \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" is a reasonable one.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a statement of two possibilities. If we add the information \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we cannot conclude with certainty that the milk is on the counter because \"might not be\" does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is still chilling in the fridge. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This is consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which denies the necessity of the milk being in the fridge. So, from \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two exclusive options. If we know \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then the necessity of the milk being in the fridge is negated. This leaves us with the only other option presented, which is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
