            "content": "Let's consider each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. This means that it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. So, from this statement, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nQuestion 2: We have two premises here: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\" The second premise introduces a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the keys could still be dangling in the cabinet. Since the first premise presents an either/or scenario and we do not have definitive information that rules out the keys being in the cabinet, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This is equivalent to saying that it is not necessarily the case that the keys are in the cabinet. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Again, we have two premises: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" The second premise negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet, leaving us with the only other option presented in the first premise, which is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
