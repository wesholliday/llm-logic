            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\". The second statement, \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" doesn't definitively rule out B. It only suggests that B is not certain. Since B is still possible, we can't conclusively infer that A (the keys are in the drawer) must be true.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have the disjunction \"Either A or B\". The second statement, \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" directly contradicts the \"must\" in B of the first statement. If B is false, and we know that either A or B must be true, then A must be true.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" means there's a possibility they are not in the cabinet. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not necessarily the case that the keys are dangling in the cabinet.\" This is the same as saying \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" The two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
