Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities.\nThe second statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests uncertainty about Fido being in the garden.\nThis uncertainty doesn't eliminate the possibility of Fido being in the garden, nor does it confirm that Fido is inside.\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we start with \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\".\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" eliminates the second option.\nIf one option of an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other must be true.\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests uncertainty about Fido's location.\n\"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it's not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\nThe first statement (might not be) implies the second statement (not must be).\nIf something might not be the case, then it's not necessarily the case.\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
