            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\". The second statement says \"B might not be true\". However, just because B might not be true doesn't necessarily mean it isn't true. It's still possible for B to be true. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude that A must be true. We don't have enough information to say for certain that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have the disjunction \"Either A or B\". The second statement now says \"It's not the case that B\". This is a stronger statement than in Question 1. If we know for certain that B is not the case, and we know that either A or B must be true, then we can conclude that A must be true. In this case, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis question is about the relationship between \"might not\" and \"not must\". If something might not be the case, it means it's not necessarily true. This is equivalent to saying it's not the case that it must be true. \"Might not\" and \"not must\" are logically equivalent statements. Therefore, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
