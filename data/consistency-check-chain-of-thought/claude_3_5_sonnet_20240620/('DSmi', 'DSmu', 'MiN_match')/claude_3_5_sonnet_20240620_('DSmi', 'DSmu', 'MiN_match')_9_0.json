            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement gives us two possibilities: the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\nThe second statement tells us that the sock might not be under the bed. This doesn't rule out the possibility that it is under the bed; it just means it's not certain.\nSince there's still a possibility that the sock is under the bed, we can't definitively conclude that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we start with two possibilities: the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\nThe second statement here is stronger than in Question 1. It says that it's not the case that the sock must be under the bed. This effectively eliminates the second option.\nIf the sock can't be under the bed, and those were the only two options, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" means there's a possibility it's not under the bed.\n\"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" means it's not certain or necessary that the sock is under the bed.\nIf something might not be true, then it's also correct to say that it's not necessarily true.\nTherefore, the first statement does indeed imply the second.\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
