            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement gives us two possibilities: either the remote is on the coffee table OR it must be under the couch.\nThe second statement says the remote might not be under the couch. This doesn't eliminate the possibility that it is under the couch; it just says it's not certain.\nTherefore, we can't definitively conclude that the remote is on the coffee table. Both options are still possible.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we start with two possibilities: either the remote is on the coffee table OR it must be under the couch.\nThe second statement here is stronger than in Question 1. It says it's not the case that the remote must be under the couch. This eliminates the second option entirely.\nIf the second option is eliminated and we only had two options to begin with, then the first option must be true.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the remote is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The remote might not be hiding under the couch\" means there's a possibility it's not under the couch.\n\"It's not the case that the remote must be hiding under the couch\" means it's not certain or necessary that it's under the couch.\nIf something might not be the case, then it's definitely not certain or necessary.\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
