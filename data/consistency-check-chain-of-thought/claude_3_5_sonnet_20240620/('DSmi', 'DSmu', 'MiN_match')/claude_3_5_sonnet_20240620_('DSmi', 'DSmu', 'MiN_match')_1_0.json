            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a disjunction (OR statement).\nThe second statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" doesn't definitively rule out the book being on the table.\nSince there's still a possibility that the book is on the table, we can't conclusively say that the book is on the shelf.\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The book is on the shelf\" from these statements.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have the disjunction \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\".\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" directly negates one part of the disjunction.\nIn a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true for the whole statement to be true.\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there's a possibility the book is not on the table.\n\"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it's not necessary for the book to be on the table.\nThe first statement (might not) is actually stronger than the second (not must), because \"might not\" allows for the possibility of not being on the table, which implies it's not necessary for it to be there.\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
