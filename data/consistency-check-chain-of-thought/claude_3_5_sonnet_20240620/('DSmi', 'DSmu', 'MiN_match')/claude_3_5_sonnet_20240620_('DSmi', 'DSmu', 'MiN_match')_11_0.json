            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is an \"either-or\" statement: \"Either A or B\". The second statement says \"B might not be true\". However, just because B might not be true doesn't necessarily mean A must be true. B could still be true, we just don't know for certain. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have the \"either-or\" statement: \"Either A or B\". The second statement here is stronger: \"It's not the case that B\". This means B is definitely false. In an \"either-or\" scenario, if one option is false, the other must be true. Therefore, if it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis question is about the relationship between \"might not\" and \"not must\". If something might not be true, then it's not necessarily true, which means it's not the case that it must be true. \"Might not\" implies uncertainty, while \"not must\" denies necessity. Therefore, if the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, it's indeed not the case that it must be hanging in the closet.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
