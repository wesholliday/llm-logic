            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first premise states: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\nThe second premise states: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\nThis is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism. If we have two options, and we know one is false, then the other must be true. Since we're told it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe first premise is the same: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\nThe second premise is different: \"Fido might not be in the garden\"\nThis is trickier. \"Fido might not be in the garden\" doesn't necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden. It only suggests a possibility. This doesn't definitively rule out the second part of our disjunction (\"Fido must be in the garden\"), so we can't conclusively infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe're given: \"Fido might not be in the garden\"\nWe're asked if we can infer: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\nIf Fido might not be in the garden, then it logically follows that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. If Fido must be in the garden, then it wouldn't be possible for Fido to not be in the garden. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
