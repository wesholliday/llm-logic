            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\"\nThe second statement negates B: \"Not B\"\nIn logic, when we have \"A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can conclude A.\nSo yes, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have \"Either A or B\"\nBut this time, the second statement is weaker: \"B might not be true\"\nThis doesn't definitively rule out B, so we can't be certain about A.\nWe can't infer that the umbrella is in the car from these statements.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet\" means there's a possibility it's not in the closet.\nIf something might not be true, then it can't be necessarily true.\n\"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" is equivalent to saying it's not necessarily in the closet.\nSo yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
