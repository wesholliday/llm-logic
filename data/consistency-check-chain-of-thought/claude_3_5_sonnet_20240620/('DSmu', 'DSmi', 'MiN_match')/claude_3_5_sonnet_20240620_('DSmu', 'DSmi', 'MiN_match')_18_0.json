Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\"\nThe second statement negates B: \"Not B\"\nIn logic, if we have \"A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can conclude A.\nSo yes, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have the disjunction \"Either A or B\"\nBut this time, the second statement is weaker: \"B might not be true\"\nThis doesn't definitively rule out B, so we can't be certain about A.\nWe can't make a definitive inference here.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The watch might not be on his wrist\" means there's a possibility it's not on his wrist.\nIf there's a possibility it's not on his wrist, then it can't be the case that it must be on his wrist.\n\"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" is logically equivalent to \"The watch might not be on his wrist\"\nSo yes, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
