Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first premise states: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nThe second premise states: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nThis is a classic case of disjunctive syllogism. If we have two options, and we know one is false, then the other must be true. Since we know it's not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe first premise is the same as in Question 1.\nThe second premise states: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nThis is different from Question 1. \"Might not be\" is not the same as \"is not.\" The notebook might not be on the nightstand, but it also might be. This doesn't eliminate the nightstand as a possibility, so we can't conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe premise states: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nIf something might not be the case, then it cannot be necessarily true. \"Might not be\" implies a possibility of not being, which contradicts \"must be.\" Therefore, if the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it's indeed not the case that it must be there.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
