            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\"\nThe second statement negates B: \"Not B\"\nIn logic, when we have \"A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can conclude A.\nSo yes, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have \"Either A or B\"\nBut this time, the second statement is weaker: \"B might not be true\"\nThis doesn't completely rule out B, so we can't be certain about A.\nWe can't make a definitive inference here.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" means it's possible that it's not blending in.\n\"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" means it's not necessary that it's blending in.\nIf something might not be true, then it's indeed not necessary that it's true.\nSo yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
