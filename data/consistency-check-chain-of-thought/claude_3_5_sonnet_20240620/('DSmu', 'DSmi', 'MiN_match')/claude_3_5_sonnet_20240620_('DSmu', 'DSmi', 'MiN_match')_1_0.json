            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first premise states: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\nThe second premise states: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nThis is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism. We have two options, and we're told that one of them is false. Therefore, the other must be true. Since it's not the case that the book must be on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe first premise is the same: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\nThe second premise is different: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThis is trickier. \"Might not be\" is not the same as \"is not.\" It leaves open the possibility that the book could be on the table. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe're given: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nWe need to consider the relationship between \"might not be\" and \"must be.\" If something might not be the case, then it cannot be that it must be the case. These are contradictory statements. Therefore, from \"might not be,\" we can indeed infer \"it's not the case that it must be.\"\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
