            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\". The second statement negates B: \"Not B\". In formal logic, when we have \"A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can indeed conclude A. This is a valid logical inference known as disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, from these premises, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 2:\nHere, we have the same disjunction \"Either A or B\", but the second statement is different. \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" is not the same as \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\". The word \"might\" introduces uncertainty. It doesn't completely rule out the possibility that the jacket is in the closet. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis question is about the relationship between \"might not\" and \"not must\". If something might not be the case, then it's indeed not the case that it must be so. \"Might not\" implies a possibility of not being, which contradicts \"must be\". Therefore, we can infer from \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\".\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
