            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there's a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This is equivalent to saying that it's not necessary (or \"must\") that the sunglasses are on her head. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe're given two pieces of information:\n1. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\"\n2. \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\"\n\nThe first statement presents two options, while the second statement suggests that one of these options (perched on her head) is not certain. However, \"might not be\" doesn't completely rule out the possibility that they are on her head. It only introduces uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, we have two pieces of information:\n1. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\"\n\nThis time, the second statement definitively rules out one of the options from the first statement. If it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, and we know it must be one of the two options, then we can logically conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
