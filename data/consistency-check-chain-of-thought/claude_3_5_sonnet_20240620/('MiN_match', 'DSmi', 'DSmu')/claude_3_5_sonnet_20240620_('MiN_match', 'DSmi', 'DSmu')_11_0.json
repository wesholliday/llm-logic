            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there's a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. If something might not be true, then it's not necessarily true. Therefore, it's correct to say \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" The original statement allows for the possibility that the jacket is elsewhere, which contradicts any claim that it must be in the closet.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two pieces of information:\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\"\n2. \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\"\n\nThe first statement gives us two options, and the second statement tells us that one of these options (hanging in the closet) is not certain. However, just because it might not be in the closet doesn't mean it definitely isn't. We can't conclusively say it's draped over the chair based on this information alone.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, we have two pieces of information:\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\"\n\nThis time, the second statement definitively rules out one of the options from the first statement. If it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, then according to the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer all the questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
