            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n\"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there's a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. If something might not be the case, then it's not necessarily true that it must be the case. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises here:\n1. \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\"\n2. \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, and the second premise tells us that one of these options (must be chilling in the fridge) is not necessarily true. However, \"might not be\" doesn't completely rule out the possibility that the milk is in the fridge. It only suggests uncertainty. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, we have two premises:\n1. \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\"\n\nThis time, the second premise completely rules out one of the options from the first premise. If it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, and we know it must be either on the counter or in the fridge, then we can logically conclude that it must be on the counter.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer all the questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
