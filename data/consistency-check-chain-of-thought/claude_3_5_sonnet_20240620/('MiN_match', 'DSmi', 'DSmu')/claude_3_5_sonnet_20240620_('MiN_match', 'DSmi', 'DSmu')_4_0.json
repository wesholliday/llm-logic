            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there's a possibility the cookies are not in the pantry. This is equivalent to saying it's not necessary (or \"must\") that the cookies are in the pantry. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" from the given statement.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises here:\n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\"\n2. \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, while the second premise tells us that one of these options (hidden in the pantry) is not certain. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the other option (in the jar) must be true. The cookies could be somewhere else entirely. We don't have enough information to conclude definitively that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, we have two premises:\n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\"\n\nThis time, the second premise directly negates one of the options in the first premise. If it's not the case that the cookies must be in the pantry, and we know they must be either in the jar or in the pantry, then we can logically conclude that they must be in the jar.\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
