            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. If this is true, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden. If Fido must be in the garden, there would be no possibility of him not being there. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises here:\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n2. \"Fido might not be in the garden\"\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that it's possible for Fido not to be in the garden. This contradicts the second part of the first premise (\"Fido must be in the garden\"). Since one part of the \"either/or\" statement is false, the other part must be true for the whole statement to be true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, we have two premises:\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nThe second premise directly contradicts the second part of the \"either/or\" statement in the first premise. Since we know for certain that \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false, and we have an \"either/or\" statement, we can conclude that the other option must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes"
