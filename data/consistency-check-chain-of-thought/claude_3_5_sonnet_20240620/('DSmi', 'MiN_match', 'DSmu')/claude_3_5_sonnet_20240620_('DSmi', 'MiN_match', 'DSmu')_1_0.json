            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a disjunction (OR statement). This means one of these must be true, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of both being true.\nThe second statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" doesn't definitively state that the book is not on the table. It only suggests a possibility.\nGiven these, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The book is on the shelf\". The book could still be on the table, even though it might not be.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies uncertainty about the book's location.\nIf something \"must\" be true, there is no uncertainty about it.\nTherefore, the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does indeed imply that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe first statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" gives us two possibilities.\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" eliminates the second possibility.\nGiven that one of the two possibilities must be true (from the first statement), and we've ruled out one of them, we can conclude that the remaining possibility must be true.\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
