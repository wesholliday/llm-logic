            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement gives us two possibilities: the toy is either in the toy box OR it must be on the bookshelf.\nThe second statement tells us that the toy might not be on the bookshelf.\nHowever, \"might not be\" doesn't mean \"is definitely not\". It only introduces uncertainty.\nTherefore, we can't conclusively say that the toy is in the toy box. It could still be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies uncertainty about its location on the bookshelf.\nIf something might not be true, then it cannot be a necessity or a \"must\".\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe first statement again gives us two possibilities: the toy is either in the toy box OR it must be on the bookshelf.\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf.\nThis eliminates the second possibility from the first statement.\nTherefore, if it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer all the questions:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
