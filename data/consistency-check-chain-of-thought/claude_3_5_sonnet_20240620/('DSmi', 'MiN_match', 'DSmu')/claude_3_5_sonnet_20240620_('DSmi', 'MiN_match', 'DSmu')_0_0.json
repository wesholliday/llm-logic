            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a disjunction. It means one of these two options must be true.\nThe second statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean Fido is inside. The phrase \"might not be\" doesn't exclude the possibility that Fido is in the garden.\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\nIf Fido \"must\" be in the garden, then there would be no possibility of him not being there.\nSince we're told that Fido might not be in the garden, it contradicts the idea that he must be there.\nTherefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" as our first premise.\nThe second premise states \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\nThis eliminates the second part of our disjunction from the first premise.\nIn a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true for the whole statement to be true.\nTherefore, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer all the questions:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
