Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement says \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This is an exclusive or statement.\nThe second statement says \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\" This doesn't definitively state that the notebook is not on the nightstand, only that it might not be.\nBecause the second statement doesn't conclusively rule out the nightstand, we can't definitively say the notebook is in the drawer. The notebook could still be on the nightstand.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies uncertainty.\nIf something might not be the case, then it cannot be said that it must be the case.\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe first statement is the same as in Question 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nThe second statement now definitively says \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer. If it's not necessarily on the nightstand (as stated in the second premise), then according to the first premise, it must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, I'm ready to provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
