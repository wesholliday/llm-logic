            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nWe're given two premises:\n1. Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nThis is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism. We have an \"either/or\" statement, and we're told that one of the options is false. Therefore, the other option must be true. So yes, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe need to consider the relationship between \"might not be\" and \"must be.\"\n- If something \"might not be\" the case, it means it's possible that it's not the case.\n- If something \"must be\" the case, it means it's definitely true and cannot be false.\n\nThese two statements are contradictory. If something might not be true, then it cannot be something that must be true. Therefore, yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet from the statement that they might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe're given two premises:\n1. Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nThis is similar to Question 1, but with a subtle difference. The second premise is not as strong as in Question 1. \"Might not be\" doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that the keys are in the cabinet. It only suggests that it's possible they're not there.\n\nBecause of this uncertainty, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer. The keys might still be in the cabinet, even though they might not be.\n\nNow, let's provide the answers:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
