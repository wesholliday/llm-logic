            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\"\nThe second statement negates B: \"Not B\"\nIn logic, when we have \"A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can conclude A.\nSo yes, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" means it's possible they're not in the pantry.\n\"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" also means it's possible they're not in the pantry.\nThe second statement is actually stronger than the first, as it rules out the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry.\nSo yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have \"Either A or B\" again.\n\"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" is not as strong as \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\".\n\"Might not be\" doesn't rule out the possibility that they are in the pantry, it just says it's possible they're not.\nWithout definitively ruling out B, we can't conclude A.\nSo no, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar from these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
