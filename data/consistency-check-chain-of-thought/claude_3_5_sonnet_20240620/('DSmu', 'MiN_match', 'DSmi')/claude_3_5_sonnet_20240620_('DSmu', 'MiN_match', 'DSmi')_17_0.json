            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nPremise 1: Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nThis is a classic case of disjunctive syllogism. We have two options, and we're told that one of them is false. Therefore, the other must be true. Since it's not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2:\nPremise: The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nIf something might not be the case, then it cannot be necessarily true. \"Might not\" implies a possibility of not being true, which contradicts \"must be\". Therefore, if the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it's indeed not the case that it must be there.\n\nQuestion 3:\nPremise 1: Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\nPremise 2: The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nThis is similar to Question 1, but with a subtle difference. \"Might not be\" is not the same as \"is not the case that it must be\". While \"might not be\" suggests that it's possible for the notebook to not be on the nightstand, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that it is there. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say that the notebook is in the drawer based on these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
