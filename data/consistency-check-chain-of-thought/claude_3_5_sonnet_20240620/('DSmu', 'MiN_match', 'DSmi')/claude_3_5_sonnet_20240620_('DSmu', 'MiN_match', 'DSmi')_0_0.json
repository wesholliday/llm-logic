            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\nThe first premise states: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\nThe second premise states: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nThis is a classic case of disjunctive syllogism. We have two options, and we're told that one of them is false. Therefore, the other must be true. Since it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, Fido must be inside.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\"Fido must be in the garden\" would mean there's no possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nThese two statements contradict each other. If Fido might not be in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have:\n\"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\"\n\nFrom Question 2, we know that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\".\n\nThis situation is now identical to Question 1. We have a disjunction (either A or B), and we know that B is false. Therefore, A must be true.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer all the questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes"
