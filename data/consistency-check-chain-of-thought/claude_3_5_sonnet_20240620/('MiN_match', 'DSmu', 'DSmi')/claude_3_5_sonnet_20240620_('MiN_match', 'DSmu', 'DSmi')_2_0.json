            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there's a possibility the keys are not in the cabinet. If we negate this, we get \"It's not the case that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" which is equivalent to saying \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" Therefore, the original statement does indeed imply \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" The answer to this question is yes.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the keys are in the drawer. The answer to this question is yes.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n2. \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nWhile the second premise suggests that the keys might not be in the cabinet, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that they are. The first premise requires that if the keys are not in the drawer, they must be in the cabinet. Since we don't know for certain that they're not in the cabinet, we can't definitively conclude that they're in the drawer. The answer to this question is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
