            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. If this is true, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden. If Fido must be in the garden, there would be no possibility of him not being there. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options. If it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, then the only remaining option from the first premise is that Fido is inside. This is a valid logical inference.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n2. \"Fido might not be in the garden\"\n\nThis case is similar to Question 2, but with a subtle difference. \"Fido might not be in the garden\" doesn't definitively rule out that Fido must be in the garden; it only suggests a possibility that he's not. This doesn't give us enough information to conclusively say that Fido is inside. We can't make a definitive inference here.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer all the questions:\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
