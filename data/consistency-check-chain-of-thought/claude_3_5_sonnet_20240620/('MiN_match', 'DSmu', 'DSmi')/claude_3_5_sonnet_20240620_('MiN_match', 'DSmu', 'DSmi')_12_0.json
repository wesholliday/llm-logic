            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there's a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf. This is equivalent to saying it's not necessary (or not a must) that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" from the given statement.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe're given two premises:\n1. \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options. By logical deduction, if one of the two options must be true, and we know one is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe're given two premises:\n1. \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n2. \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n\nWhile the first premise is the same as in Question 2, the second premise is slightly different. \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" doesn't completely rule out the possibility that it is on the bookshelf. It only suggests that there's a chance it's not there. This isn't strong enough to definitively eliminate one of the options from the first premise. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
