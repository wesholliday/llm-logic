            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n\"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there's a possibility the jacket is not in the closet. If something might not be true, then it's not necessarily true. Therefore, it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" is a logical inference from the given statement.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options. By logical deduction, if one of the two options must be true, and we know one is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\"\n2. \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\"\n\nThis case is different from Question 2. The second premise doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of the jacket being in the closet; it only says it might not be there. This leaves open the possibility that the jacket could still be in the closet. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot conclusively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair. The jacket might be over the chair, or it might be in the closet - we don't have enough information to be certain.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
