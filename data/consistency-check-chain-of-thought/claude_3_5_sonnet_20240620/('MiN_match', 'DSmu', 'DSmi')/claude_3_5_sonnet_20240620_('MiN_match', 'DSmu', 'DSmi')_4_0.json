            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there's a possibility the cookies are not in the pantry. This is equivalent to saying it's not certain or necessary that the cookies are in the pantry. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" The answer to this question is yes.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\"\n\nThe first premise gives us two options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options. By logical deduction, if one of the two options must be true, and we know one is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\" The answer to this question is yes.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\"\n2. \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\"\n\nWhile this seems similar to Question 2, there's a crucial difference. The second premise doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry; it only says they might not be there. This uncertainty means we can't conclusively infer that the cookies are in the jar. The cookies could still be in the pantry, even though they might not be. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive inference. The answer to this question is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
