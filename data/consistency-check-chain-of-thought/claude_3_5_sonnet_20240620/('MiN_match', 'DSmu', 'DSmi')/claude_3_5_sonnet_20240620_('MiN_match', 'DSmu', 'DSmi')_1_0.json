            "content": "Let's think through these questions step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there's a possibility that the book is not on the table. If something might not be the case, then it's not necessarily true. Therefore, it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" is a logical inference from the given statement.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe're given two premises:\n1. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\"\n\nThe first premise presents two options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options. By logical deduction, if one of two options is false, the other must be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe're given two premises:\n1. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\"\n2. \"The book might not be resting on the table\"\n\nWhile the second premise suggests that the book might not be on the table, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that it is on the table. The statement \"might not be\" is not as strong as \"is not\" or \"cannot be.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. The possibility that it's on the table still exists, even if it's not certain.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
