            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We are given that either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. \n- We are also given that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n- \"Might not\" doesn't necessarily mean they are not in the cabinet. It just means it's possible they are not.\n- So we can't definitively conclude the keys are in the drawer. They could still possibly be in the cabinet.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- We are given that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n- If something \"might not\" be the case, then it logically follows that it's not the case that it \"must\" be so.\n- \"Might not\" and \"must\" are logically incompatible.\n- Therefore, yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We are given that either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n- We are also given that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n- If the keys aren't definitely in the cabinet, and the only other option is the drawer, then they must be in the drawer.\n- The two premises together allow us to logically conclude the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
