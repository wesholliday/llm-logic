            "content": "Question 1:\nThe first premise states that the cookies are either in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. The second premise says the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This leaves open the possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the cookies are in the jar, as there could be other unstated locations. We can't definitively infer the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 2:\nYes, if the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, then it logically follows that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. \"Might not be\" contradicts \"must be\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nNow we have the first premise from Question 1 (cookies are either in jar or must be in pantry) combined with the inference from Question 2 (it's not the case cookies must be in pantry). If the cookies aren't definitely in the pantry, and the only other option given is the jar, then we can logically infer the cookies are in the jar in this case.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
