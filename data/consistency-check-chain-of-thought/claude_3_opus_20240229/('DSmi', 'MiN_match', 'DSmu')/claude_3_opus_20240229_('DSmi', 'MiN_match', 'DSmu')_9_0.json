            "content": "Question 1: The first statement says the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. The second statement says it might not be under the bed. This leaves open the possibility that it could still be under the bed, just not with certainty. So we cannot definitively conclude it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, if the sock might not be under the bed, that means it's not the case that it must be under the bed. \"Might not be\" contradicts \"must be\".\n\nQuestion 3: The first statement sets up the two possibilities - laundry basket or under the bed. The second statement rules out that it must be under the bed. By process of elimination, if those are the only two options, and it's not definitely under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
