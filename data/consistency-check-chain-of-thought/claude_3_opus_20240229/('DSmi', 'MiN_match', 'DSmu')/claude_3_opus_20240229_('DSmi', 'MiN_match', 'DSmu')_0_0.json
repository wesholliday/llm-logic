            "content": "Let's think through each question step-by-step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- We are told \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". This means Fido is either definitely inside, or definitely in the garden. \n- We are also told \"Fido might not be in the garden\". This introduces the possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- However, just the possibility of Fido not being in the garden is not enough to conclude definitively that Fido must be inside. Fido could still be in the garden, we just aren't certain.\nSo no, we cannot infer for certain that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means there is a possibility Fido is not in the garden. \n- This directly contradicts \"Fido must be in the garden\", which states Fido is definitely in the garden.\n- So yes, from \"Fido might not be in the garden\", we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\".\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We have \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\", meaning Fido is definitely in one of those two locations.\n- We also have \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\", eliminating the garden as a definite location.\n- With the garden eliminated, the only remaining definite location from the initial statement is inside. \n- Therefore, yes, combining these two statements allows us to infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
