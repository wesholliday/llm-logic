            "content": "Question 1: The first statement says the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack. The second statement says it might not be on the coat rack. From these, we can't definitively conclude the scarf is in the backpack, because \"might not be on the coat rack\" leaves open the possibility that it still could be on the coat rack. So no, we cannot infer for certain that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" means there's a possibility it's not on the coat rack. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\", because \"must\" would mean there's no possibility of it not being on the coat rack.\n\nQuestion 3: The first statement says the scarf is either in the backpack or must be on the coat rack. The second statement says it's not the case that the scarf must be on the coat rack. If we rule out that it must be on the coat rack, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that it's in the backpack. So yes, in this case we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
