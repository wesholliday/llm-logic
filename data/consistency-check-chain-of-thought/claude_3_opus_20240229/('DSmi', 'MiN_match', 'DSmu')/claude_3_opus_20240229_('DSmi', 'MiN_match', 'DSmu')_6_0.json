            "content": "Question 1:\nThe first premise states that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet. The second premise says the umbrella might not be in the closet. This leaves open the possibility that the umbrella could still be in the closet, just not with certainty. So we cannot definitively conclude the umbrella is in the car. The inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 2:\nYes, this inference is valid. If the umbrella might not be in the closet, then it cannot be the case that it must be in the closet. \"Might not be\" contradicts \"must be\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nFrom the first premise, the umbrella is either in the car or it must be in the closet. The second premise states it's not the case that it must be in the closet. This rules out the second possibility in the first premise. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the umbrella is in the car. So yes, in this case the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
