            "content": "Question 1: \nThe first statement says the toy is either in the box or on the bookshelf. The second statement says it might not be on the bookshelf. From these, we cannot definitively conclude the toy is in the box, because \"might not be on the bookshelf\" leaves open the possibility that it still could be on the bookshelf. The two statements together do not rule out the bookshelf location with certainty.\n\nQuestion 2:\nYes, \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" means there is a possibility it is not on the bookshelf. This is logically equivalent to saying \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\", because \"must\" implies certainty, while \"might not\" implies it's not certain.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe first statement says the toy is either in the box or on the bookshelf. The second statement (derived from Question 2) says it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, i.e. the bookshelf location is not certain. Combining these, if it's not definitively on the bookshelf, then by process of elimination from the two possible locations given, it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
