            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We are given that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. \n- We are also told that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n- \"Might not be\" does not necessarily mean it is not on his wrist. It only means there's a possibility it's not on his wrist.\n- So we can't definitively conclude the watch is charging on the dresser. It could still possibly be on his wrist.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- We are told the watch might not be on his wrist.\n- If something \"might not\" be the case, then it cannot be the case that it \"must\" be so.\n- Therefore, yes, from \"The watch might not be on his wrist\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\".\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We know either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n- We also now know it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n- If it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist, then the other possibility must be true.\n- Therefore, yes, combining the two statements, we can infer the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
