            "content": "Question 1:\nThe first statement says the book is either on the shelf or on the table. The second statement says the book might not be on the table. This leaves open the possibility that the book is not on the table. In that case, based on the first statement, it must be on the shelf. However, \"might not be on the table\" also allows for the possibility that the book is on the table. In that case, we can't be sure it's on the shelf. Since both possibilities are open, we cannot logically conclude for certain that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"The book might not be resting on the table\" means there is a possibility the book is not on the table. If something \"must\" be the case, that means there is no possibility of it not being the case. So saying something \"might not\" be the case is logically equivalent to saying it's not the case that it \"must\" be the case. \n\nQuestion 3:\nThe first statement says the book is either on the shelf or it must be on the table. The second statement says it's not the case that the book must be on the table. Combining these, we can rule out the possibility of the book being on the table, because if it were, the second statement would be false. With the table possibility eliminated, the first statement tells us the book must therefore be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
