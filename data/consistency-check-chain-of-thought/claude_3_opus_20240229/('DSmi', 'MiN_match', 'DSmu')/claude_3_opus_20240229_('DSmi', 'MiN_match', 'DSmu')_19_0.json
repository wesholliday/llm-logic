            "content": "Question 1: No, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are definitely in her bag. The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" allows for the possibility that they are not on her head, but it doesn't rule out the possibility completely. So while they could be in her bag, we can't say for certain based on the given information.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Saying \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" is equivalent to saying it's not necessarily true that they are on her head. In other words, it's not the case that they must be there.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, in this case we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. We are told that either the sunglasses are in the bag or they must be on her head. Then we are told that it's not the case that they must be on her head. This rules out the second possibility in the \"either/or\" statement. Therefore, the first possibility must be true - the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
