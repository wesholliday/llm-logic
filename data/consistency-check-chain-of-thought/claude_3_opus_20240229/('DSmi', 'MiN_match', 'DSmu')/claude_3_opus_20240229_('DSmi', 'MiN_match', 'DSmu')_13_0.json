            "content": "Question 1: The first premise states that the milk is either on the counter or chilling in the fridge. The second premise says the milk might not be in the fridge. This leaves open the possibility that the milk is in the fridge, so we cannot definitively conclude the milk is on the counter. The milk could still be in either location.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, if the milk might not be in the fridge, then it cannot be the case that it must be in the fridge. \"Might not be\" contradicts \"must be\".\n\nQuestion 3: The first premise presents two possibilities - the milk is either on the counter or must be in the fridge. The second premise rules out the possibility that the milk must be in the fridge. With that option eliminated, the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that the milk is on the counter. So in this case, we can logically infer the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
