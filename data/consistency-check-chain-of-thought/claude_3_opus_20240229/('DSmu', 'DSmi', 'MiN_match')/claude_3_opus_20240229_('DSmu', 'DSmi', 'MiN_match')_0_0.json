Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Question 1: \nThe first premise states \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". This is a disjunction - at least one of the disjuncts must be true. \nThe second premise states \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". This negates the second disjunct.\nIf the second disjunct is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the first disjunct must be true. \nTherefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside\". The argument is valid.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe first premise is the same disjunction as before.\nThe second premise states \"Fido might not be in the garden\". This is weaker than saying Fido is definitely not in the garden. There's still a possibility Fido is in the garden.\nIf there's a possibility Fido is in the garden, then we cannot definitively conclude Fido must be inside. The second disjunct has not been ruled out.\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\". The argument is invalid.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe premise states \"Fido might not be in the garden\". \nIf it's possible that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden. \n\"Must\" implies certainty, while \"might not\" allows for uncertainty. They are incompatible.\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". The argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
