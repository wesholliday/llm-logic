            "content": "Question 1: The first statement says the remote is either on the coffee table or under the couch. The second statement says it's not the case that the remote must be under the couch. This means the remote could still possibly be under the couch, just that it's not necessarily there. So we can't definitively conclude the remote is on the coffee table. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: Similar to question 1, the first statement gives two possible locations for the remote. The second statement says the remote might not be under the couch, meaning it could be but isn't definitely there. This leaves open the possibility the remote is under the couch, so we cannot logically infer it must be on the coffee table. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: If the remote might not be under the couch, that means it's possible it's not under the couch. But saying it might not be there is not the same as saying it definitely is not there. \"Might not be\" allows for the possibility it is under the couch, while \"must not be\" rules out that possibility entirely. So we cannot infer the stronger \"must not\" statement from the weaker \"might not\" statement. The answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, no, no"
