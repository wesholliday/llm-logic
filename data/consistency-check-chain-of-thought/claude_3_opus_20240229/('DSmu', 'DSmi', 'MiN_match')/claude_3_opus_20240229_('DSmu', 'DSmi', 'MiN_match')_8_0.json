            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We are given \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\". Let's call this statement P.\n- We are also given \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\". Let's call this statement Q.\n- P is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), and Q negates the second disjunct of P.\n- If the second disjunct is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the first disjunct must be true.\n- Therefore, yes, from P and Q we can infer \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nQuestion 2:\n- We are given the same statement P as before.\n- We are also given \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\". Let's call this statement R.\n- R is weaker than Q. It allows for the possibility that the missing piece is not on the floor, but doesn't rule out that it could be.\n- With P and R, it's possible that the missing piece is in the box, but it's not certain. The piece could still be on the floor.\n- Therefore, no, from P and R we cannot infer with certainty that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We are given only statement R: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\".\n- R states that it's possible the piece is not on the floor. But \"might not\" is not the same as \"must not\".\n- Just because something might not be the case doesn't mean it definitely isn't the case.\n- Therefore, no, from R alone we cannot infer Q, \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\".\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no"
