            "content": "Question 1: \nThe statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" is a disjunction. It says that one of the two options must be true. \nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" negates the second option in the disjunction.\nIf the second option is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the first option must be true.\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\n\nQuestion 2:\nAgain, we have the disjunction \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\".\nHowever, the second statement is different: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\". This allows for the possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but doesn't rule it out completely.\nSo even if the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it could still be there, and thus we can't definitively say it must be in the drawer.\nWe don't have enough information to infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that it's possible the notebook is not on the nightstand.\nHowever, this is not the same as saying \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\".\n\"Must\" is a stronger claim than \"might\". If something might not be the case, it could still be the case. But if something must not be the case, then it definitely isn't the case.\nSo we can't infer the stronger claim from the weaker one.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no"
