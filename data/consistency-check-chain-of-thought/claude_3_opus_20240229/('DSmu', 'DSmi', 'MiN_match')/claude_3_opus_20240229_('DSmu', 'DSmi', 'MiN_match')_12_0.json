            "content": "Question 1: The first premise states that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second premise negates the second option, saying it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf. If it's not on the bookshelf, then based on the first premise, it must be in the toy box. So yes, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The first premise is the same as before. But the second premise is different - it says the toy might not be on the bookshelf. This leaves open the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf, just not necessarily. So we cannot rule out the bookshelf option, and therefore cannot definitively conclude the toy must be in the toy box. The answer is no, we cannot make that inference.\n\nQuestion 3: If the toy might not be on the bookshelf, that means it's not necessarily on the bookshelf. Saying it might not be there is equivalent to saying it's not the case that it must be there. So yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
