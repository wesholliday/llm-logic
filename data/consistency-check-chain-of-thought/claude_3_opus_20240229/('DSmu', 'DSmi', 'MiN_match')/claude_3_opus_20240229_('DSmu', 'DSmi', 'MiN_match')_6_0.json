            "content": "Question 1: The first statement says the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet. The second statement says it's not the case that the umbrella must be in the closet. If it's not necessarily in the closet, and the only other option given is the car, then we can logically conclude the umbrella is in the car. So yes, we can make that inference.\n\nQuestion 2: The first statement is the same as before. But the second statement is different - it says the umbrella might not be in the closet. This leaves open the possibility that the umbrella could still be in the closet, just not with certainty. So we cannot rule out the closet as we could in Question 1. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the umbrella is in the car. The answer is no, we cannot make that inference.\n\nQuestion 3: If the umbrella might not be in the closet, that means it's not guaranteed or certain to be in the closet. Saying it might not be there is equivalent to saying it's not the case that it must be there. These statements have the same logical meaning. So yes, we can make the inference in Question 3.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
