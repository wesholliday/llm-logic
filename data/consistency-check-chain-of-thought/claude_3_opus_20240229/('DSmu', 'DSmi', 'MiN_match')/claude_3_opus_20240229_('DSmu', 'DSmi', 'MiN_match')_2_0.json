But it's not definite.\n- Even if the keys might not be in the cabinet, we can't be sure they are in the drawer. They could still possibly be in the cabinet.\n- Therefore, no, we cannot infer with certainty that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We are given: The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n- If something \"might not\" be the case, that means it's not definitely the case. \n- So if the keys \"might not\" be in the cabinet, then it's true that they are not definitely in the cabinet.\n- Therefore, yes, we can infer 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
