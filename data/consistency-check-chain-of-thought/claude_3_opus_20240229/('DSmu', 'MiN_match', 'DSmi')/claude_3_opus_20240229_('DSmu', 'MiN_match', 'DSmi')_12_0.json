            "content": "Question 1: The first statement says the toy is either in the box or on the bookshelf. The second statement says it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf. This means the toy could be in the box or somewhere else, but it's not necessarily on the bookshelf. From these two statements, we can logically conclude the toy must be in the box. If it's not on the bookshelf, and the only other option given is the box, then it has to be in the box.\n\nQuestion 2: If the toy might not be on the bookshelf, that means there's a possibility it's not on the bookshelf. This directly implies that it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf. If there's any chance it's not on the bookshelf, then we can't say it must be there.\n\nQuestion 3: The first statement again says the toy is either in the box or on the bookshelf. The second statement says the toy might not be on the bookshelf. There's a chance it's not on the bookshelf, but we don't know for certain. It could still be in the box or on the bookshelf. We don't have enough information to definitively say it must be in the box. It might be, but we can't logically infer that for sure.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
