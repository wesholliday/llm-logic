Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Question 1:\nThe first premise states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be on the nightstand. This is a disjunction - at least one of those two options must be true.\nThe second premise negates the second option - it's not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand. \nIf the second option is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the first option must be true.\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2:\n'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means there's a possibility the notebook is not on the nightstand. \nIf there's a possibility it's not on the nightstand, then it cannot be the case that it must be on the nightstand.\n'Must' implies certainty, while 'might not' allows for uncertainty.\nSo yes, from 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', we can infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis combines the reasoning from the first two questions.\nFrom question 2, 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' lets us infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'.\nThen, as in question 1, combining this with the disjunction 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' allows us to infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\nSo yes, from the given premises we can reach that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes"
