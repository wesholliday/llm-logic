Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Question 1:\nThe first premise states \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the disjuncts must be true. The second premise \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the second disjunct. If the second disjunct is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the first disjunct \"Fido is inside\" must be true. Therefore, yes, we can infer \"Fido is inside\".\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" means there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not certain that Fido is in the garden\". However, this does not necessarily imply \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". Fido could still be in the garden, even if there's a possibility that he's not. So no, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis combines the premises from Questions 1 and 2. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a disjunction, and \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests the second disjunct might be false. However, as discussed in Question 2, \"might not\" does not necessarily negate \"must\". So even though Fido might not be in the garden, it's still possible that he must be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer \"Fido is inside\". The answer is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no"
