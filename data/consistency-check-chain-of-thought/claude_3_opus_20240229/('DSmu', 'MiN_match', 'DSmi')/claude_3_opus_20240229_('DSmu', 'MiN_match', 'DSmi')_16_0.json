            "content": "Question 1: The first premise states that either the scarf is in the backpack or it must be on the coat rack. The second premise negates the second option, saying it's not the case that the scarf must be on the coat rack. Using disjunctive syllogism, if we have \"A or B\" and \"not B\", we can conclude \"A\". So yes, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nQuestion 2: If the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, that means there's a possibility it is not on the coat rack. This is equivalent to saying it's not the case that the scarf must be on the coat rack, because \"must\" implies certainty, which is negated by the \"might not\". So yes, we can make that inference.\n\nQuestion 3: This is similar to Question 1, but the second premise is different. We have \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" and \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\". The second premise introduces uncertainty about the scarf being on the coat rack, but it doesn't negate it with certainty like \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" does. There's still a possibility the scarf is on the coat rack. So no, in this case we cannot infer with certainty that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
