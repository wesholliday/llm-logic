            "content": "Question 1:\nThe first premise states \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two options must be true. \nThe second premise states \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\". This negates the second option in the disjunction.\nIf the second option is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the first option must be true.\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" means there is a possibility the keys are not in the cabinet. \n\"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is a stronger statement, asserting that it is not necessarily true that the keys are in the cabinet.\nIf the keys might not be in the cabinet, then it cannot be the case that they must be in the cabinet. \nSo yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis combines the premises from Questions 1 and 2.\nFrom Question 2, \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" allows us to infer \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\".\nThen, as in Question 1, combining this with the disjunction \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" allows us to infer \"The keys are in the drawer\".\nSo yes, we can make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes"
