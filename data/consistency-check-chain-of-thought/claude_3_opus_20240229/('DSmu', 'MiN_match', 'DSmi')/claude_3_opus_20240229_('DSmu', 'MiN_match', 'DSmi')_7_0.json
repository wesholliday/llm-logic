            "content": "Question 1:\nYes, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. The first statement presents two possibilities: either the remote is on the coffee table or it must be under the couch. The second statement eliminates the possibility of the remote being under the couch. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2:\nYes, we can infer that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. If the remote might not be hiding under the couch, then it is not necessarily (or must not be) under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3:\nNo, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table in this case. The first statement presents two possibilities, but the second statement, \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" does not completely eliminate the possibility of the remote being under the couch. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it doesn't rule out the possibility entirely. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the remote being on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
