            "content": "Question 1: \n'The book might not be resting on the table' means there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. \n'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' means the book is not necessarily on the table.\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If it's possible the book is not on the table, then it's not necessarily on the table. So yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2:\n'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' presents two possibilities. \n'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' rules out the second possibility.\nWith one of the two possibilities eliminated, we can infer that the other possibility must be true. So yes, we can infer 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' presents two possibilities.\nHowever, 'The book might not be resting on the table' does not definitively rule out the second possibility. There is still a chance the book is on the table.\nWith both possibilities still open, we cannot logically infer that 'The book is on the shelf'. The book could be on the shelf or on the table. So no, the inference is not valid in this case.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
