            "content": "Question 1: \n'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet' means there is a possibility the umbrella is not in the closet. \n'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet' means the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet.\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If it might not be in the closet, then it's not the case that it must be in the closet.\n\nQuestion 2:\n'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' sets up two possibilities for the umbrella's location.\n'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet' eliminates one of those two possibilities.\nTherefore, by process of elimination, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nQuestion 3:\n'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' again sets up the two location possibilities.\nHowever, 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet' only says the closet location is not certain. It doesn't eliminate that possibility.\nSo in this case, we cannot logically infer that 'The umbrella is in the car', because it still might be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
