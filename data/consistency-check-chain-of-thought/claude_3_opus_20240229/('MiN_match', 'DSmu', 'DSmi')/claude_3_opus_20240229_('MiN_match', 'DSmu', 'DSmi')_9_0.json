            "content": "Question 1: \n'The missing sock might not be under the bed' means there's a possibility the sock is not under the bed. 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed' means the sock is not necessarily under the bed. These two statements are logically equivalent - if it might not be under the bed, then it's not the case that it must be under the bed. So yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe are told 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed'. We are also told 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed'. If it's not the case that the sock must be under the bed, then given the either/or statement, it must be in the laundry basket. So yes, we can infer the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have the same either/or statement as before: 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed'. However, this time we are told 'The missing sock might not be under the bed'. This leaves open the possibility that the sock could still be under the bed, even if it might not be. So in this case, we cannot definitively conclude the sock is in the laundry basket. The inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
