            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' means there's a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' means the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. \n- These two statements are logically equivalent. If there's a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it's not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' sets up two possibilities for the toy's location.\n- 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' eliminates one of those possibilities.\n- With one possibility eliminated, the other must be true. So we can infer the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Again, 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' sets up two possibilities.\n- 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' introduces uncertainty about one possibility, but doesn't eliminate it entirely.\n- With some uncertainty remaining, we can't definitively infer the toy's location. It could still be in either place.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
