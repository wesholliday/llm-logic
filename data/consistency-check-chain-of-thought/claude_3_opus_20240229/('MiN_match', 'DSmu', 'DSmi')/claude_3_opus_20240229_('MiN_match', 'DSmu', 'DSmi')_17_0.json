            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means there's a possibility it's not on the nightstand.\n- 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' means it's not necessarily on the nightstand. \n- These two statements are logically equivalent. If it might not be there, then it's not the case that it must be there.\nSo for question 1, we can infer the second statement from the first. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- We are given 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand'. This means it is in one of those two locations.\n- We are also given 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand', which rules out the nightstand.\n- By process of elimination, if it's not on the nightstand, and it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\nSo for question 2, we can infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Again, we have 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand', meaning it is in one of those locations.\n- But this time we have 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand'. This allows for the possibility it's not on the nightstand, but doesn't rule the nightstand out completely.\n- Since the nightstand is still a possibility, we cannot infer for certain that the notebook is in the drawer.\nSo for question 3, we cannot definitively infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'. The answer is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
