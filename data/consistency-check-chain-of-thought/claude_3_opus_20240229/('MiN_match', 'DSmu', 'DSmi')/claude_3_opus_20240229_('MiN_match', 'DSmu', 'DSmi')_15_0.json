            "content": "Question 1: \n'The pen might not be on my desk' means there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk. This is equivalent to saying 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', because if it's not necessarily on the desk, then there is a possibility it's not there.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe statement 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' presents two possibilities. If we then assert that one of those possibilities is false ('It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'), then logically the other possibility must be true. So yes, we can infer 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThis is trickier. 'The pen might not be on my desk' introduces uncertainty about the pen being on the desk, but doesn't rule out the possibility completely like question 2 did. So while it perhaps makes it more likely the pen is in the bag, we can't logically conclude that with certainty. The pen could still be on the desk, just not with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
