            "content": "Question 1: \n'Fido might not be in the garden' means there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. \n'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If there's a possibility Fido is not in the garden, then it's not necessarily true that he must be in the garden.\nSo yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2:\n'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' sets up two possibilities - Fido being inside, or Fido necessarily being in the garden.\n'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' eliminates the second possibility.\nWith one of the two possibilities eliminated, we can infer that the other possibility must be true. \nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' sets up the two possibilities.\nHowever, 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not eliminate the garden possibility. It just says there's a chance he's not in the garden.\nSo we still have both possibilities, and cannot infer with certainty that Fido is inside.\nTherefore, no, in this case we cannot infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
