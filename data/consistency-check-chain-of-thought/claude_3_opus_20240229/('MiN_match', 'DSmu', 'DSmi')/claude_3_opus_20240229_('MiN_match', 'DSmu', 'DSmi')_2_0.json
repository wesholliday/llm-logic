            "content": "Question 1: From 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'?\n\nYes, we can infer this. If the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, then it cannot be the case that they must be dangling in the cabinet. \"Might not\" implies possibility, while \"must\" implies certainty. So these statements are logically consistent with each other.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?\n\nYes, we can infer this. The first statement presents an either/or scenario - the keys are either in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities (the keys must be dangling in the cabinet). Therefore, by process of elimination, the other possibility (the keys are in the drawer) must be true.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?\n\nNo, we cannot definitively infer this. While the second statement casts doubt on the keys being in the cabinet, it doesn't eliminate that possibility entirely. \"Might not\" implies it's possible they aren't in the cabinet, but it's also possible they are. So we can't be certain the keys are in the drawer based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
