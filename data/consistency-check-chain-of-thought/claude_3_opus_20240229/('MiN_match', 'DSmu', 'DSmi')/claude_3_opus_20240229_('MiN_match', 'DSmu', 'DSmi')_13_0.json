            "content": "Question 1: \n'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' means there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. \n'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' means the milk is not necessarily in the fridge.\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If there's a possibility the milk is not in the fridge, then it's not necessarily the case that it must be in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 2:\n'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' sets up two possibilities for the milk's location.\n'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' eliminates the second possibility.\nTherefore, by process of elimination, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3:\n'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' again sets up the two possibilities.\nHowever, 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' only says there's a possibility the milk is not in the fridge. It doesn't eliminate that possibility entirely.\nSo in this case, we can't be certain the milk is on the counter. It might be, but it also might still be in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
