            "content": "Question 1: \n\"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\" means it's possible the shoes are not lined up by the door. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\", because if they might not be, then they are not necessarily (must be) lined up by the door.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe are told \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\". We are also told \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\". If the shoes are not necessarily by the door, then based on the either/or statement, they must be in the closet. So yes, we can infer the shoes are in the closet.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\" leaves open the possibility that the shoes are lined up by the door. It doesn't rule that option out completely like question 2 did. So even with the either/or statement, we cannot infer for certain that the shoes must be in the closet, because they still might be by the door.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
