            "content": "Question 1:\n'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' means there's a possibility the cookies are not in the pantry. \n'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' means the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry.\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If it's possible the cookies are not in the pantry, then they are not necessarily in the pantry. So yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: \nWe are told 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry'. This means the cookies are either in the jar, or if they are not in the jar, then they must be in the pantry.\nWe are also told 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry', which rules out the second possibility above.\nTherefore, we can conclude the cookies must be in the jar. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, we have 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry'. \nBut this time, the second piece of information is 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry'. This allows for the possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but doesn't rule it out completely.\nSo we cannot conclude for certain that the cookies are in the jar. They could be in the jar or in the pantry. The answer is no, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
