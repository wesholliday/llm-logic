            "content": "Question 1: Yes. If the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, that means it's possible they are not perched on her head. Therefore, it cannot be the case that they must be perched on her head.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes. We are told that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. We are also told that it's not the case that they must be perched on her head. By process of elimination, if they are not perched on her head, they must be in her bag.\n\nQuestion 3: No. Although we are told the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, this doesn't rule out the possibility that they could still be perched on her head. \"Might not\" is different from \"must not\". Since there is still a possibility they are on her head, we cannot definitively conclude they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
