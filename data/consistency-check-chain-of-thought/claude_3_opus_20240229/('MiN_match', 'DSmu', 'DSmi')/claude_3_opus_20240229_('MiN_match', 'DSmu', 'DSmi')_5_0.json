            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n\"The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen\" means there is a possibility that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. \n\"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\" means the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen.\nThese two statements are equivalent. If there's a possibility the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it's not the case that it must be ringing in the kitchen. So yes, we can make that inference.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\" sets up two possibilities. \n\"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\" eliminates one of those possibilities.\nTherefore, if the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, it must be in the living room. So yes, we can infer the phone is in the living room.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\" sets up two possibilities.\nHowever, \"The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen\" only says there's a possibility it's not ringing in the kitchen. It doesn't eliminate that possibility entirely.\nSo in this case, we can't be certain the phone is in the living room. It still might be ringing in the kitchen. We don't have enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no"
