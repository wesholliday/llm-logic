            "content": "Question 1:\nFrom \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\", we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cookies are in the jar\". The first statement presents two possibilities, but the second statement only says the cookies might not be in the pantry, not that they definitely aren't. So while the cookies being in the jar is possible, we can't be sure based on these statements alone.\n\nQuestion 2:\nFrom \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\", we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\". The first statement gives two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities (the cookies being in the pantry). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nQuestion 3:\nFrom \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\", we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\". \"Might not\" expresses uncertainty but allows for the possibility that the cookies are in the pantry. In contrast, \"It's not the case that the cookies must be\" is a stronger statement that definitively rules out the cookies being in the pantry. The former does not necessarily imply the latter.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no"
