            "content": "Question 1: From the first statement, we know the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. The second statement says it might not be in the fridge. This leaves open the possibility that the milk is in the fridge, so we cannot definitively conclude it is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 2: The first statement is the same as before. The second statement now says the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. Combined with the first statement, this means the milk must be on the counter. If it's not the case that the milk must be in the fridge, and those are the only two options, then it has to be on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: If the milk might not be in the fridge, that means there's a possibility it's not in the fridge. But this is not the same as saying it's definitely not the case that the milk must be in the fridge. \"Might not be\" allows for the possibility that it still could be, whereas \"not the case that it must be\" rules out that it has to be in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no"
