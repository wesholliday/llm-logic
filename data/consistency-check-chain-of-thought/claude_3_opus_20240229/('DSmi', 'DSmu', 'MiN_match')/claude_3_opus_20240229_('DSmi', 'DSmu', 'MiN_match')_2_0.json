            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We are given \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\". This means at least one of those two statements must be true.\n- We are also given \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\". This means it's possible the keys are not in the cabinet. \n- However, this doesn't necessarily mean the keys are not in the cabinet. They still could be.\n- Therefore, we can't definitively conclude the keys are in the drawer. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Again, we have \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\", meaning at least one is true.\n- Now we are given \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\". This negates the second possibility.\n- If the second part is not true, and we know at least one part must be true, then the first part must be true.\n- Therefore, we can conclude the keys are in the drawer. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" means it's possible the keys are not in the cabinet.\n- \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means the keys are not definitely in the cabinet.\n- These are not the same thing. Just because something might not be true doesn't mean it must not be true.\n- Therefore, we cannot make the inference. The answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no"
