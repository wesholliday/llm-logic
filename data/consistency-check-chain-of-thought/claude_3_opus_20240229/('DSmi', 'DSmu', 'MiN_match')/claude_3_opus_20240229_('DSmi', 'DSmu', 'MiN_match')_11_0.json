            "content": "Question 1: The first statement says the jacket is either on the chair or in the closet. The second statement says it might not be in the closet. From these, we can't definitively conclude the jacket is on the chair, because \"might not be in the closet\" allows for the possibility it still could be in the closet. So we cannot infer with certainty that the jacket is on the chair.\n\nQuestion 2: The first statement is the same as before. The second statement now says it's not the case that the jacket must be in the closet. In other words, the jacket is not necessarily in the closet. Combining this with the either/or statement, if the jacket is not necessarily in the closet, then it must be on the chair. So in this case, yes, we can infer the jacket is on the chair.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, we can infer this. If the jacket might not be in the closet, that means it's not the case that the jacket must be in the closet. \"Might not be\" and \"must be\" are opposites here.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
