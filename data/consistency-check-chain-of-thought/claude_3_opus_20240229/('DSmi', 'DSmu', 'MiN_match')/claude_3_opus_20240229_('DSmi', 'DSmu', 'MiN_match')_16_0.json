            "content": "Question 1: From the statements \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" and \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\", we cannot definitively infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\". The word \"might\" in the second statement leaves open the possibility that the scarf is on the coat rack, so we can't rule out that option and conclude it must be in the backpack.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, from \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" and \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\", we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\". The first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, leaving only one remaining option.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, from \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\". If there's a possibility the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it cannot be the case that it must be on the coat rack. The word \"must\" implies certainty, which is negated by the uncertainty conveyed by \"might not\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
