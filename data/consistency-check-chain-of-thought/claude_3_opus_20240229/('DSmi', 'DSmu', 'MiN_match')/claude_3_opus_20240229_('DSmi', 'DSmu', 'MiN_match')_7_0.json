            "content": "Question 1: From the statements \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\", we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\". The second statement only suggests that it's possible the remote is not under the couch, but doesn't rule out that possibility entirely. So the remote could still be under the couch or on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, from \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\", we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\". The second statement rules out the possibility of the remote being under the couch. So given the either/or scenario in the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the remote is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, from \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\". Saying the remote \"might not\" be under the couch means it's not certain or necessary that it's under the couch. This is equivalent to saying it's not the case that it \"must\" be under the couch.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
