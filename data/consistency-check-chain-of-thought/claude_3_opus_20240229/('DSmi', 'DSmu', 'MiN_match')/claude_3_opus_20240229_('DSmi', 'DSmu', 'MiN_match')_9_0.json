            "content": "Question 1: No, we cannot infer that the missing sock is definitely in the laundry basket. The statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" allows for the possibility that the sock is not under the bed, but it doesn't rule out that possibility completely. The sock could still potentially be under the bed, so we can't conclude with certainty that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. The first statement presents two possibilities: the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" eliminates the possibility of the sock being under the bed. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" from \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\" If there's a possibility that the sock is not under the bed, then it cannot be the case that the sock must be under the bed. \"Must\" implies certainty, while \"might not\" allows for uncertainty or other possibilities.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
