            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- We are told \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". This means Fido is either inside or in the garden, but not both.\n- We are also told \"Fido might not be in the garden\". This means there's a possibility Fido is not in the garden.\n- However, just because there's a possibility Fido is not in the garden, that doesn't necessarily mean he is inside. He could be somewhere else entirely.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Again, we have \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". \n- This time, we are told \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". This means Fido is not required to be in the garden.\n- If Fido is not required to be in the garden, and we know he is either inside or in the garden, then he must be inside.\n- Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We are told \"Fido might not be in the garden\", meaning there's a possibility he's not in the garden.\n- However, this is not the same as saying \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". \n- Just because there's a possibility Fido is not in the garden, that doesn't mean he's not required to be there. He could still be required to be in the garden, even if there's a chance he's not.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no"
