            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We are given \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\". This means one of those two options must be true.\n- We are also given \"The watch might not be on his wrist\". This means it's possible the watch is not on his wrist. \n- However, just because it's possible the watch is not on his wrist, that doesn't necessarily mean it is charging on the dresser. It could be somewhere else entirely.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Again, we have \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\". One of those must be true.\n- Now we are given \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\". This eliminates the second option.\n- If the watch is not on his wrist, and we know it must be either on the dresser or the wrist, then we can infer it must be on the dresser.\n- Therefore, yes, we can infer the watch is charging on the dresser in this case.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" means it's possible the watch is not on his wrist.\n- \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" means the watch is not necessarily on his wrist.\n- These two statements are logically equivalent. If it's possible the watch is not on his wrist, then it's not necessarily on his wrist.\n- Therefore, yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes"
