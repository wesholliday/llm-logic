            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' means it's possible that Fido is not in the garden. \n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n- If it's possible Fido is not in the garden, then he's not necessarily in the garden. \nSo yes, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' from 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- We are told 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'. \n- We are also told 'Fido might not be in the garden', meaning it's possible he's not in the garden.\n- But just because it's possible he's not in the garden doesn't mean he definitely is inside. He could be somewhere else.\n- The 'might not' doesn't eliminate the garden possibility completely, so we can't be sure he's inside.\nSo no, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' from these statements together.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Again we have 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'.\n- But now we have 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', which eliminates the garden possibility.\n- Since Fido must be either inside or in the garden, and he's not necessarily in the garden, he must be inside.\nSo yes, in this case we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
