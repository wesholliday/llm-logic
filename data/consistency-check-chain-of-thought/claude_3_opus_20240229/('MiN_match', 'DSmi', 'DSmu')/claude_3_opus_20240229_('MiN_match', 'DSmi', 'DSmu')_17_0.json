            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means there's a possibility it's not on the nightstand.\n- 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' means it's not necessarily on the nightstand. \n- These two statements are logically equivalent. If it might not be there, then it's not the case that it must be there.\nSo for question 1, we can infer the second statement from the first. \n\nQuestion 2:\n- We are told 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand'. This means it has to be in one of those two places.\n- We are also told 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand'. This leaves open the possibility it's not on the nightstand.\n- Just because it might not be on the nightstand doesn't necessarily mean it is in the drawer. It could be somewhere else entirely. \nSo for question 2, we cannot infer for certain that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Again, we are told 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand'. \n- This time, we are told 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'. This rules out it necessarily being on the nightstand.\n- Since it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand, and it's not the case that it must be on the nightstand, we can infer it must be in the drawer.\nSo for question 3, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
