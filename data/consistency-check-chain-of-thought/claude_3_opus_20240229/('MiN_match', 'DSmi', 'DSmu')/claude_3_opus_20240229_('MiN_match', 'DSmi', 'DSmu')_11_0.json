            "content": "Question 1: Yes, we can infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet' from 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet'. If the jacket might not be in the closet, then it's not necessarily (i.e. must be) in the closet.\n\nQuestion 2: No, we cannot infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair' with certainty. 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet' only tells us there's a possibility it's not in the closet, but doesn't guarantee it's on the chair. It could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, in this case we can infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'. We are told the jacket is either on the chair or must be in the closet. Since we are also told it's not the case that it must be in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that it's on the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
