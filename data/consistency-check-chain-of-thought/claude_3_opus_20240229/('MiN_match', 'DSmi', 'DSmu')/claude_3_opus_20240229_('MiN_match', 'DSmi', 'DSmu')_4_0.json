            "content": "Question 1: \n'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' means there's a possibility the cookies are not in the pantry. \n'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' means the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry.\nThese two statements are equivalent - if there's a possibility the cookies are not in the pantry, then they are not necessarily in the pantry. So yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2:\n'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' sets up two possibilities for the cookies' location.\n'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' introduces uncertainty about the cookies being in the pantry.\nHowever, this uncertainty alone is not enough to rule out the pantry possibility and definitively say the cookies are in the jar. They still might be in the pantry. So no, we cannot infer 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAs before, 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' gives two location possibilities.\nBut 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' definitively rules out the pantry. \nSince the pantry is ruled out, and the jar was the only other possibility stated, we can now infer that the cookies must be in the jar. So yes, in this case we can infer 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
