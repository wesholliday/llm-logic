            "content": "Question 1: Yes, we can infer 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch' from 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch'. If the remote might not be under the couch, then it's not the case that it must be under the couch.\n\nQuestion 2: No, we cannot definitively infer that 'The remote control is on the coffee table' from the given statements. While 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch' suggests it could be somewhere else, like the coffee table, it doesn't guarantee that it is on the coffee table. It could potentially be in another location not mentioned.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, in this case we can infer that 'The remote control is on the coffee table'. The first statement presents two possibilities: either the remote is on the coffee table or it must be under the couch. The second statement eliminates the second possibility, since it's not the case that the remote must be under the couch. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
