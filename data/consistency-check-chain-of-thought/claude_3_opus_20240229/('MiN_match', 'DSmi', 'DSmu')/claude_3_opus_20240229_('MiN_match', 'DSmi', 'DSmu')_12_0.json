            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n\"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" means there's a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf. \n\"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If it might not be on the bookshelf, then it's not the case that it must be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" sets up two possibilities for the toy's location.\n\"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces uncertainty about one of those possibilities (the bookshelf).\nHowever, this uncertainty alone is not enough to definitively conclude the toy is in the toy box. It could still possibly be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 3:\nAgain, \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" gives us two possibilities.\n\"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" eliminates the bookshelf as a necessary location.\nWith the bookshelf eliminated, the only remaining possibility from the initial statement is the toy box. \nTherefore, we can logically conclude the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
