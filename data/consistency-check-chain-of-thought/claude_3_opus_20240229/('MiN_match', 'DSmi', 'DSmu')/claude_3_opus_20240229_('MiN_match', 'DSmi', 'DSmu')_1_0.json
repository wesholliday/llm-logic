            "content": "Let's think through each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- 'The book might not be resting on the table' means there is a possibility that the book is not on the table.\n- 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' means the book is not necessarily on the table. \n- These two statements are logically equivalent. If there's a possibility the book is not on the table, then it's not necessarily on the table, and vice versa.\nSo the answer to Question 1 is yes.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' gives us two possibilities for the book's location.\n- 'The book might not be resting on the table' introduces uncertainty about whether the book is on the table.\n- However, this uncertainty alone is not enough to conclude with certainty that the book must be on the shelf. It could still possibly be on the table.\nSo the answer to Question 2 is no.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Again, 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' gives us two possibilities.\n- 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' eliminates the necessity of the book being on the table.\n- With the table location eliminated as a necessity, the only remaining possibility from our initial statement is that the book is on the shelf.\nSo the answer to Question 3 is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
