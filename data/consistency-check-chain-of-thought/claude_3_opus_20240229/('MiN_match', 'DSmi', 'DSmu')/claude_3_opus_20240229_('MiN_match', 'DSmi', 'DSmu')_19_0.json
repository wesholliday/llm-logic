            "content": "Question 1: Yes, we can infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head' from 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head'. If they might not be perched on her head, then it cannot be the case that they must be perched on her head.\n\nQuestion 2: No, we cannot infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag' from the given statements. 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' only tells us it's possible they are not on her head, but doesn't rule out the possibility completely. So we can't definitively conclude they must be in the bag.\n\nQuestion 3: Yes, in this case we can infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'. If we know it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, that eliminates one of the two possibilities given in the \"either/or\" statement. The only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes"
