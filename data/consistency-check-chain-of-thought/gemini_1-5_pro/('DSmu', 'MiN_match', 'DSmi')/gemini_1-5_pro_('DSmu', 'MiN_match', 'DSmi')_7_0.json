If one option in an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other option must be true.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise:** The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies possibility, not certainty. Just because the remote might not be under the couch doesn't mean it's definitely not there. \n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n* **Premise 2:** The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Reasoning:**  Similar to question 2, the second premise only introduces possibility.  We don't have enough information to definitively say the remote is on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
