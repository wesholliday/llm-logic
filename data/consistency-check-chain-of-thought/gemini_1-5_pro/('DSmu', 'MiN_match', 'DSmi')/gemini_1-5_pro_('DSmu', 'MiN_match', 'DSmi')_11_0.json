We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies possibility. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's possible it's not true. This is the same as saying it's not necessarily true, or \"it's not the case that it must be\" true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** While the first statement gives us two options, the second statement only introduces the possibility that one option is false. It doesn't definitively rule it out. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude the jacket is on the chair. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
