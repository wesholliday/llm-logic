We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves us with only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be somewhere, it means it's not guaranteed to be there, which is the same as saying it's not a necessity.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** No. While the first statement gives us two options, the second statement only introduces uncertainty about one option. It doesn't definitively rule out the notebook being on the nightstand. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
