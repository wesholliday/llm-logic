We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be somewhere, it means it's not guaranteed to be there, which is the same as saying it's not necessarily the case.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  While it might seem like we can conclude this, we cannot. \"Might not be on my desk\" doesn't definitively rule out the pen being on the desk. It just introduces uncertainty. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
