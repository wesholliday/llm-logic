It simply says it's not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n* **Premise 2:** The missing sock might not be under the bed.\n\nWhile Premise 2 suggests the sock might not be under the bed, it doesn't rule out the possibility.  We cannot definitively conclude the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
