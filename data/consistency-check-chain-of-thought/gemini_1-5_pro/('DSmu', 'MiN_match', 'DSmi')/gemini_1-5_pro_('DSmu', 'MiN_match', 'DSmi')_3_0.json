We have two options, and one is ruled out. This leaves us with the other option as true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies there's a possibility the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. If there's even a chance the cat isn't there, then it's not a certainty (must) that it is.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** While the first statement gives us two options, the second statement only introduces a possibility that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. It doesn't definitively rule it out. Therefore, we can't definitively say the cat is on the couch.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
