We have two options (either/or), and we eliminate one. This leaves us with the other option as true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"Might not\" implies possibility, while \"must\" implies necessity. Just because something might not be true doesn't mean it's necessarily not true.  \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Similar to question 2, \"might not\" doesn't give us enough information to definitively say the sunglasses are in her bag. They could be elsewhere.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
