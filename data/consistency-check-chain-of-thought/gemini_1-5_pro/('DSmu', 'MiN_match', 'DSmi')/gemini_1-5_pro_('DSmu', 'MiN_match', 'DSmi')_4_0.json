We have two options (cookies in the jar or hidden in the pantry) and we eliminate one (not hidden in the pantry). This leaves only one valid option.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies possibility, while \"must\" implies necessity.  Just because the cookies might not be in the pantry doesn't mean they couldn't be. \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Similar to question 2, the statement \"the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" doesn't definitively eliminate the possibility that they are in the pantry.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
