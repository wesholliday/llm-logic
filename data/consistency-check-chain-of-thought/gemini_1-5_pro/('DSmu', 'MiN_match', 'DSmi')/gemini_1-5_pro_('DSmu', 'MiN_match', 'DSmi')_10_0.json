We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies possibility. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's possible it's not true. This is different from saying something is definitely not true. \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch' together with 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Similar to question 2, the statement \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\" doesn't definitively rule out the porch as a location.  We don't have enough information to conclude the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
