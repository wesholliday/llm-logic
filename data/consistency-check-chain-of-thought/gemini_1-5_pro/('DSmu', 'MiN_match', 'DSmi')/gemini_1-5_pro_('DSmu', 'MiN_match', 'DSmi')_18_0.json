It doesn't definitively tell us it's NOT on his wrist.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n* **Premise 2:** The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nWhile the first premise gives us two options, the second premise doesn't eliminate the possibility of the watch being on his wrist.  Therefore, we can't definitively say it's charging on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
