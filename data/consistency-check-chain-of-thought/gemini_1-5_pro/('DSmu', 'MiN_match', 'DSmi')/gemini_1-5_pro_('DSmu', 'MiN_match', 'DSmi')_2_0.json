            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:**\n\n* The first statement presents two possibilities: keys in the drawer or keys dangling in the cabinet.\n* The second statement eliminates the possibility of the keys dangling in the cabinet. \n* Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" means it's possible they aren't there. \n* However, \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means it's definitively NOT the case they are there.\n* The first statement allows for the possibility, while the second statement eliminates it. They are not equivalent.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* We're given the same starting point as Question 1 (two possibilities).\n* This time, the second statement says the keys *might not* be dangling in the cabinet. This doesn't definitively rule out that possibility.\n* Therefore, we can't definitively conclude the keys are in the drawer. \n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
