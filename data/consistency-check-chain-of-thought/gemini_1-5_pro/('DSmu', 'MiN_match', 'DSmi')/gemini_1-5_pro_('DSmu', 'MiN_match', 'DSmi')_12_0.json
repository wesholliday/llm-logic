We have two options (toy in box or on shelf) and are told the second option is false. This leaves only one possibility: the toy must be in the toy box.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies possibility. If the toy *might not* be on the bookshelf, it means it's possible it's not there. This is the same as saying it's not necessarily true (or not a certainty) that the toy is on the bookshelf.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  While the first statement gives us two options, the second statement only introduces a possibility that the toy isn't on the bookshelf. It doesn't definitively rule out the bookshelf. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
