We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves us with only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these are logically equivalent.  If something \"might not\" be the case, then it \"is not necessarily\" the case, which is the same as saying \"it's not the case that it must\" be the case.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** No. While the first statement gives us two options, the second statement only introduces the possibility that one option is false. It doesn't definitively rule it out. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
