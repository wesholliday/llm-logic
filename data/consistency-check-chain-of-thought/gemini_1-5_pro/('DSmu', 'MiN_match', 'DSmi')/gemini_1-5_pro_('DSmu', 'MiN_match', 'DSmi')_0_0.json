Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

We're given two possibilities, and then told one isn't true. This forces the other possibility to be true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's possible it's not true.  If Fido *must* be somewhere, there's no possibility of him not being there. So, if he might not be in the garden, he can't be *required* to be in the garden.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This combines the logic of the first two questions. We have two options, and the second question tells us the second option isn't necessarily true. This leaves us with only the first option.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
