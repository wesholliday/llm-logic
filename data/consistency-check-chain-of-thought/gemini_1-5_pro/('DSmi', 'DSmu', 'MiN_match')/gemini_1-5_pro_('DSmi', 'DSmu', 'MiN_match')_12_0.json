The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities might not be true.  However, it's still possible the toy IS on the bookshelf.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two possibilities. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. This leaves only one option: the toy must be in the toy box.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Saying something \"might not\" happen is the same as saying it's not guaranteed to happen. If the toy might not be on the bookshelf, then it's not guaranteed to be on the bookshelf, meaning it's not the case that it MUST be there.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
