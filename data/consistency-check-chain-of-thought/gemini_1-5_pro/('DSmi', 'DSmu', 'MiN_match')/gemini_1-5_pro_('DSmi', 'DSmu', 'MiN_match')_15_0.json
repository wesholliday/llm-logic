This still leaves the possibility that the pen is on the desk, just not definitively. Therefore, we cannot definitively say the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one of those options (\"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\").  This leaves only one possibility: the pen must be in the bag.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** If something \"might not\" be somewhere, it means it's possible it's not there. This directly implies that it's not guaranteed or necessary for it to be there. Therefore, it's not the case that the pen *must* be on the desk. \n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
