This leaves open the possibility that the shoes ARE in the closet, but doesn't definitively prove it. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door' together with 'It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door', can we infer 'The shoes are in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one of those options.  Therefore, the remaining option MUST be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The shoes might not be lined up by the door', can we infer 'It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the shoes *might not* be lined up by the door doesn't mean they are definitely NOT lined up by the door. \n\n**Answer: no, yes, no** \n"
