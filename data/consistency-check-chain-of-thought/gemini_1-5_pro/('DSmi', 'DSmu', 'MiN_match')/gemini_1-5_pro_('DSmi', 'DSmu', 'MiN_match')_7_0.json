However, \"might not\" doesn't rule it out completely. The remote could still be under the couch. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' together with 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one of those options.  Therefore, only the first option remains as a possibility.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"Might not\" implies there's a possibility it's NOT under the couch. This means it's not absolutely certain the remote MUST be under the couch.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
