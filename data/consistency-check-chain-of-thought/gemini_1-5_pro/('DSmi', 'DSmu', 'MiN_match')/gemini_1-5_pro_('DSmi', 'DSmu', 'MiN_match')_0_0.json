            "content": "**Question 1: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido is definitely in the garden. The second statement tells us it's possible Fido is NOT in the garden.  This eliminates the second possibility of the first statement, leaving only one option: Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is very similar to Question 1. The second statement directly eliminates the possibility that Fido \"must be in the garden.\"  Again, this leaves only one option from the first statement: Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** If Fido \"might not\" be in the garden, it means there's a possibility he's not there. If there's even a chance he's not in the garden, then it cannot be true that he \"must\" be in the garden. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
