Even if the jacket *might* not be in the closet, it still *could* be. Premise 1 only states it must be in one of the two locations, not that it definitively isn't in the closet.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\n**Reasoning:** Premise 2 eliminates the possibility of the jacket being in the closet. Since Premise 1 states it has to be in one of the two locations, and the closet is ruled out, the jacket must be on the chair.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" doesn't equal \"must not\". The jacket *might* not be in the closet, but that doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that it *must* be there. \n\n**Answer: no, yes, no** \n"
