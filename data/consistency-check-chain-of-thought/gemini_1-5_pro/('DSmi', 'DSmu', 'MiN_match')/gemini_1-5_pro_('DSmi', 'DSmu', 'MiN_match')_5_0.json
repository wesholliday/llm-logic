However, \"might not\" doesn't rule out the possibility that it IS ringing in the kitchen. Therefore, we can't definitively say the phone is in the living room.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen' together with 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen', can we infer 'The phone is in the living room'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This time, the second statement directly negates the second possibility presented in the first statement. Since we are told one of the two MUST be true, if the second isn't true, the first one must be.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen', can we infer 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not be ringing\" implies it's possible the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen. This directly contradicts the idea that the phone \"must\" be ringing there. \n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
