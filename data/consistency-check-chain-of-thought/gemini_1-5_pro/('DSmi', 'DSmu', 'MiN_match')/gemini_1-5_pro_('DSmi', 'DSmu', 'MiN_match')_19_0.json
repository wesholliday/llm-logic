The second statement casts doubt on one possibility but doesn't eliminate it.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one option. This leaves only one possibility: the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies possibility.  Just because the sunglasses might not be on her head doesn't mean they *can't* be.  \n\n**Answer: no, yes, no** \n"
