Just because the sock *might not* be under the bed doesn't mean it definitely isn't. It could still be in either location.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This time, the second statement eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. Since the sock *must* be in one of the two places, and it's not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The missing sock might not be under the bed', can we infer 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements essentially mean the same thing. If the sock *might not* be under the bed, then it's not guaranteed to be there, meaning it's not the case that it *must* be there.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
