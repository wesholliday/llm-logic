Just because the umbrella might not be in the closet doesn't definitively mean it's in the car. It could be elsewhere.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes! The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one option. Therefore, only one option remains, and we can definitively conclude the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes!  If something \"might not\" be somewhere, it means it's not guaranteed to be there. This implies it's not a certainty or a necessity for the umbrella to be in the closet.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
