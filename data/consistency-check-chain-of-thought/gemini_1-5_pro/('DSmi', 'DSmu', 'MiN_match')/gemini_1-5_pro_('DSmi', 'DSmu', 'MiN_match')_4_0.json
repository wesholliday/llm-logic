The second statement says one possibility *might* not be true. This still leaves the other possibility, so we can infer the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Again, we have two possibilities. The second statement eliminates one possibility.  This leaves only one remaining option, so the cookies must be in the jar.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Just because the cookies *might* not be in the pantry doesn't mean they are definitely not in the pantry.  We cannot make this inference.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
