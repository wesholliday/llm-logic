            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** The first statement says the keys are either in the drawer or dangling. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the keys dangling. This uncertainty doesn't rule out the keys being in the drawer. \n\n**Question 2:** The first statement is the same as before. The second statement now definitively says the keys are NOT dangling.  Since the first statement gives us only two options, and we've eliminated one, the other must be true.\n\n**Question 3:** \"Might not\" implies possibility, while \"it's not the case\" implies certainty.  We cannot infer a definite statement from one expressing possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
