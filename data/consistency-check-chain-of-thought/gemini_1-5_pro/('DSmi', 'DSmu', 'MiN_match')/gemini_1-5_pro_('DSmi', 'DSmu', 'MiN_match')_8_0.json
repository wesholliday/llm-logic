Just because it *might not* be blending in doesn't mean it's definitely not. Premise 1 leaves open the possibility that it IS blending in.  Therefore, we can't definitively say it's in the box.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nPremise 2 eliminates the second option presented in Premise 1. Since the puzzle piece isn't blending in, and Premise 1 states it must be one or the other, it must be in the box.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\n\"Might not\" does not equal \"is not.\" The premise allows for the possibility that the piece IS blending in. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it's definitely not blending in.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, no** \n"
