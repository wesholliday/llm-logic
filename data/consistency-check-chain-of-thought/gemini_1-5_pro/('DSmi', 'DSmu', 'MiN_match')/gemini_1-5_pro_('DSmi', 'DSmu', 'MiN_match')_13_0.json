The milk could still be on the counter even if it's not chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The second statement eliminates one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement. This leaves only one remaining possibility: the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Saying something \"might not\" be true is the same as saying it's not necessarily true. If the milk might not be in the fridge, then it's not necessarily true that it MUST be in the fridge. \n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
