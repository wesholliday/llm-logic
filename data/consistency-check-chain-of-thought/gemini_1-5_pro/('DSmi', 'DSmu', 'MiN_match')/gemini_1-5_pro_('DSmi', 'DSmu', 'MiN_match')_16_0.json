            "content": "**Question 1:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n* **Premise 2:** The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\n**Reasoning:** Premise 2 tells us it's possible the scarf isn't on the coat rack, but it doesn't rule out the possibility. Premise 1 allows for the scarf to be in the backpack. Therefore, we can't definitively say the scarf IS in the backpack.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\n**Reasoning:** Premise 2 eliminates the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack. Since Premise 1 gives us only two options, and one is ruled out, the other option (scarf in backpack) must be true.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" means it's possible the scarf isn't on the coat rack, but it doesn't mean it's definitively NOT on the coat rack.  \n\n**Answer: no, yes, no** \n"
