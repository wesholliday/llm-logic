Even if the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it could still be there. Premise 1 only states it must be in one of the two locations, not that it cannot be on the nightstand.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\n**Reasoning:** Premise 2 eliminates the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand. Since Premise 1 states it must be in one of the two locations, the only remaining possibility is the drawer.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" does not equal \"must not.\" Just because the notebook might not be on the nightstand doesn't mean it's impossible for it to be there. \n\n**Answer: no, yes, no** \n"
