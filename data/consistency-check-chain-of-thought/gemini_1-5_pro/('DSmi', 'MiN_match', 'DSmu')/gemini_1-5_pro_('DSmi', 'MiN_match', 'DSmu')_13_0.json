            "content": "**Question 1: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement presents two possibilities: milk on the counter or milk in the fridge. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the milk being in the fridge.  While it's possible the milk is on the counter, the second statement doesn't rule out the fridge entirely. \n\n**Question 2: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. \"Might not\" implies a lack of certainty about the milk being in the fridge, which directly translates to \"it's not the case that it MUST be\" there.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, we can now definitively infer this. The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one of those options. Therefore, only the remaining option (milk on the counter) can be true.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
