If the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it's still possible they are in the drawer. \n\n**Question 2: From 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's not definitely true, which is the same as saying it's not necessarily or \"must\" be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, this follows logically. The first statement gives us two options, and the second statement eliminates one of those options. Therefore, only the remaining option (keys are in the drawer) can be true.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
