The second statement introduces uncertainty about the cookies being in the pantry. This uncertainty doesn't eliminate the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry, it just means they might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies there's a possibility the cookies are not in the pantry. This directly contradicts the idea that the cookies \"must\" be in the pantry.  \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one of those options.  This leaves only one remaining possibility: the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
