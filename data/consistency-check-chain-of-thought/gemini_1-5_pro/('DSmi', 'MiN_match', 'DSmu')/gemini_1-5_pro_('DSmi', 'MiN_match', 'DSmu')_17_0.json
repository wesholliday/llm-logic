            "content": "**Question 1: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement casts doubt on one of those possibilities. If the notebook might not be on the nightstand, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that it's in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  These two statements are essentially saying the same thing. If something \"might not\" be somewhere, it means it's not guaranteed to be there, which is the same as saying it \"must not\" be there.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is a rephrasing of Question 1.  We're given two possibilities, and then told one of those possibilities is not true. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
