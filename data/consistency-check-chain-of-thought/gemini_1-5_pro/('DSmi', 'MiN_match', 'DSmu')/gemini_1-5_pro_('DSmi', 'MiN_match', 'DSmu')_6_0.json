If the umbrella might not be in the closet, it could still be in the car. \n\n**Question 2: From 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's not definitely true, and therefore it's not a certainty or a \"must.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, this follows logically. The first statement gives us two options, and the second statement eliminates one of those options. Therefore, only the remaining option (the umbrella is in the car) can be true.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
