Since we don't know for sure if the cat is playing in the bedroom, we can't definitively say the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies there's a possibility the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. This directly contradicts the idea that the cat \"must\" be playing there. \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one option.  Therefore, the remaining option must be true.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
