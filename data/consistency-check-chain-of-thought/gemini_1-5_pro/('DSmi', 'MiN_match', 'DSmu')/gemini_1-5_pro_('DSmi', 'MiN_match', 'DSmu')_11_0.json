This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"Might not\" implies that something is possible, but not certain. If the jacket might not be in the closet, it means it's not guaranteed to be there, so it's not a necessity.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is the same logical structure as question 1. We're given two options and then told one option isn't true.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
