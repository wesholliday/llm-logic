The second statement tells us the book might *not* be on the table. This eliminates one possibility, leaving us with the conclusion that the book must be on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The book might not be resting on the table', can we infer 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Saying \"might not\" is the same as saying it's possible the book is not on the table. If it's possible the book is not on the table, then it can't be definitely true that the book *must* be on the table.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' together with 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table', can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is a rephrasing of Question 1. We're given two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of them. This leaves only one remaining possibility: the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
