If it's possible the sunglasses aren't on her head, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that they are in her bag.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, then it \"is not necessarily\" true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is the same logical structure as question 1, just phrased slightly differently.  We're eliminating one possibility, leaving us with the other.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
