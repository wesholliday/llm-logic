It's possible the remote is neither on the table nor under the couch.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's not definitely true, and therefore it's not a certainty or a \"must.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' together with 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, this follows logically. The first statement gives two options, and the second statement eliminates one option. Therefore, the remaining option must be true.\n\n**Answer: no, yes, yes** \n"
