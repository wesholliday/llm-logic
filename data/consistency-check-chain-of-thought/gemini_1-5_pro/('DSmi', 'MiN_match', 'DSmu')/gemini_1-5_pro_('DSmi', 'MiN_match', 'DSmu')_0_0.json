            "content": "**Question 1: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement presents two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden. The second statement tells us it's possible Fido is NOT in the garden. This eliminates the second possibility of the first statement, leaving only one option: Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  If Fido *might not* be in the garden, it means it's possible he's not there. This directly contradicts the idea that Fido *must* be in the garden. \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is very similar to Question 1. We're given two options, and the second statement eliminates one of those options. This leaves us with only one possibility: Fido is inside.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
