If the sock might not be under the bed, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that it's in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The missing sock might not be under the bed', can we infer 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent.  Saying something \"might not\" be true means it's not definitely true, which is the same as saying it's not necessarily or \"must\" be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is a rephrasing of Question 1. We're given two possibilities, and then told one of those possibilities is not true. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
