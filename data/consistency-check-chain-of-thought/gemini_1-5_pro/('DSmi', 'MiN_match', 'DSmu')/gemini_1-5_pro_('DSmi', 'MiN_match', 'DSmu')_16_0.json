If the scarf might not be on the coat rack, then the only remaining possibility is that it's in the backpack.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be the case, then it \"is not necessarily\" the case.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is the same logical structure as Question 1, just phrased slightly differently.  We're eliminating one possibility, leaving only the other.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
