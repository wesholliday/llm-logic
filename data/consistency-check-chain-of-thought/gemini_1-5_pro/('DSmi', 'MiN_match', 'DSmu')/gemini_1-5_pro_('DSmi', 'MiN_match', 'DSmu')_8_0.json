If one possibility is potentially false, the other possibility becomes more likely.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"Might not\" implies that something is not certain.  If something is not certain, it cannot be stated as a definite \"must\".\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is very similar to question 1. We're given two possibilities, and then told one of those possibilities is not true. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
