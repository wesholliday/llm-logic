The second statement introduces uncertainty about the pen being on the desk. This uncertainty leaves open the possibility that the pen is indeed in the bag. \n\n**Question 2: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not be\" implies that it's possible the pen is not on the desk. This directly translates to saying it's not guaranteed or necessary (i.e., \"must\") for the pen to be on the desk.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  We're given two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. This leaves us with only one remaining option: the pen must be in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
