Therefore, the remaining possibility must be true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" implies that something is possible, but not certain. If the watch might not be on his wrist, it means it's not guaranteed to be on his wrist. This is the same as saying it's not the case that it *must* be on his wrist.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is very similar to Question 1. We're given two possibilities, and then told one of them is not true. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
