The second statement introduces uncertainty about the newspaper being on the porch. This uncertainty leaves the possibility of the newspaper being in the driveway open. \n\n**Question 2: From 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"Might not\" implies that the newspaper being on the porch is not certain. If it's not certain, then it's also not a necessity.  \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch' together with 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two options. The second statement eliminates one of those options. This leaves us with only one remaining possibility: the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
