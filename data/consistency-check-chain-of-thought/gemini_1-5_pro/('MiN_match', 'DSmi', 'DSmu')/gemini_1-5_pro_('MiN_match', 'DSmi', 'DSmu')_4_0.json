If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's possible it's not true. This aligns with saying it's \"not the case\" that it \"must\" be true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  We're given two possibilities, and told one of them \"might not\" be true. This weakens that possibility, but doesn't completely rule it out.  It's still possible the cookies are in the pantry, even if they \"might not\" be.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This time, we're told one possibility is definitely ruled out. Since we have only two options, and one is impossible, the other option must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
