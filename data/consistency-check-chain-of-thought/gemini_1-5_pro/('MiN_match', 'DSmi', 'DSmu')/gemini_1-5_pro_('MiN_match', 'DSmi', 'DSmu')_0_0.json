            "content": "**Question 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means it's possible Fido is elsewhere. This directly implies that it's not absolutely certain Fido is in the garden. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two pieces of information:\n    * Fido is either inside or definitely in the garden.\n    * It's possible Fido is NOT in the garden. \n    * Since the second statement eliminates the \"definitely in the garden\" option, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is very similar to Question 2.\n    * We know Fido is either inside or definitely in the garden.\n    * We're told it's NOT the case that Fido is definitely in the garden.\n    * Again, this leaves only one possibility: Fido is inside.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
