This means it's not absolutely certain they are on her head.  If it's not certain, then it's not a \"must\" situation.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one possibility. If something must be true, and there are only two options, eliminating one option means the other must be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is the same logic as question 2. We're told the sunglasses being on her head is not a certainty, which leaves only one other option according to the first statement.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
