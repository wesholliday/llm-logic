            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" implies there's a possibility it's not on his wrist. This directly translates to \"It's not the case that the watch *must* be on his wrist.\" If something *must* be true, there cannot be a possibility of it being false.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two possibilities, and told one of them might not be true. This strongly suggests the other possibility is true. Since the watch might not be on his wrist, the remaining possibility, \"the watch is charging on the dresser,\" becomes a likely inference.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is even more direct than Question 2. We're told one of the two possibilities is definitely not true.  This leaves only one remaining possibility: \"the watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
