            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\" implies there's a possibility the cat is elsewhere. This directly contradicts the statement \"the cat MUST be playing in the bedroom\". \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two possibilities, and the second possibility (\"must be playing in the bedroom\") is weakened by the second statement. However, just because the cat might not be playing in the bedroom doesn't definitively mean it IS napping on the couch. There could be other options.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This time, the second statement directly negates the second part of the first statement. Since one of the two options MUST be true, if the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
