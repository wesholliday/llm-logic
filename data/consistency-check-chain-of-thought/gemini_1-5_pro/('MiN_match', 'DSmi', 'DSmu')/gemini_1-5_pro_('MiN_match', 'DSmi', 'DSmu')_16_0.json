            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'?**\n\nReasoning: \"Might not\" implies that it's possible the scarf isn't on the coat rack. If it's possible the scarf isn't there, then it can't be definitely true (\"must\") that it is there.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\nReasoning: We're given that the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack. The second statement tells us the scarf might not be on the coat rack. This opens the possibility that it IS in the backpack, but doesn't definitively prove it. \n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\nReasoning: This time, we're definitively told the scarf is NOT definitely on the coat rack. Since our first statement gives us only two options (backpack or coat rack), and we've ruled out the coat rack, the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
