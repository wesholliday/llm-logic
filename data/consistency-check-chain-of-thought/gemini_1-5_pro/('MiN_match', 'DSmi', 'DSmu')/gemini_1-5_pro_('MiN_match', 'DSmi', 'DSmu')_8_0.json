This means it's not absolutely certain that the piece *must* be blending in. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The first statement gives us two possibilities. The second statement makes one of those possibilities less likely, but doesn't rule it out entirely.  It's still possible the piece is blending in, just not guaranteed.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Now we have a stronger statement. The second statement tells us it's definitely NOT the case that the piece *must* be blending in. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement, leaving only one option.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
