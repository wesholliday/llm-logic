            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The missing sock might not be under the bed', can we infer 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed'?**\n\nReasoning: \"Might not be\" implies that it's possible the sock is not under the bed. This means it's not absolutely certain the sock is under the bed.  Therefore, it's not the case that the sock *must* be under the bed.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'The missing sock might not be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\nReasoning: We're given two pieces of information. The first tells us the sock is either in the laundry basket or definitely under the bed. The second tells us it's possible the sock isn't under the bed. Since the first statement gives us only two possibilities, and the second eliminates one of those possibilities, we can conclude the remaining possibility must be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\nReasoning: This is the same logical structure as question 2. We're told the sock is either in the laundry basket or definitely under the bed. The second statement tells us the sock isn't definitely under the bed.  This leaves only one possibility: the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
