            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" means it's possible the toy is not on the bookshelf. This implies it's not guaranteed or certain that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\n**Question 2:** We're given two pieces of information: 1) The toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, and 2) The toy might not be on the bookshelf. Since the toy might not be on the bookshelf, and it has to be in one of those two places, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\n**Question 3:**  This is very similar to Question 2. We're told the toy is either in the toy box or it MUST be on the bookshelf.  The second statement tells us it's NOT the case that the toy MUST be on the bookshelf.  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
