            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch'?**\n\nReasoning: Yes, these two statements are logically equivalent. \"Might not\" implies a possibility that it isn't under the couch, which directly contradicts the idea that it \"must\" be there.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' together with 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'?**\n\nReasoning: Yes. The first statement gives us two possibilities. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. Therefore, only the remaining possibility, \"the remote control is on the coffee table,\" can be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' together with 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'?**\n\nReasoning:  Yes. This is logically the same as Question 2.  We've just rephrased the statement that eliminates the possibility of the remote being under the couch.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
