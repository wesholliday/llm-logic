            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?**\n\nReasoning: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there's a possibility the milk isn't in the fridge. This means it's not guaranteed or necessary for the milk to be in the fridge. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\nReasoning: The first statement gives us two possibilities. The second statement eliminates the possibility of the milk definitely being in the fridge.  This leaves only one option: the milk must be on the counter.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\nReasoning: This is the same logic as question 2, just phrased slightly differently.  If it's not necessarily the case the milk is in the fridge, the only other option is the counter.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
