This directly means it's not necessarily true that the book *must* be on the table. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' together with 'The book might not be resting on the table', can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?**\n\nReasoning: We're given that the book is either on the shelf or must be on the table. We're also given information that weakens the possibility of it being on the table. Since one of the two options must be true, the weakening of one option makes the other more likely.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' together with 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table', can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?**\n\nReasoning: This is very similar to question 2.  We're told the book is either on the shelf or *must* be on the table. The second statement directly eliminates the possibility that the book *must* be on the table.  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, yes** \n"
