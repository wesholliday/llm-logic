This premise doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of the shoes being by the door. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the shoes are in the closet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The shoes might not be lined up by the door.\n\nSaying the shoes \"might not\" be lined up by the door is different from saying they are definitively NOT lined up by the door.  The shoes could still be lined up by the door, even if there's a possibility they aren't.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
