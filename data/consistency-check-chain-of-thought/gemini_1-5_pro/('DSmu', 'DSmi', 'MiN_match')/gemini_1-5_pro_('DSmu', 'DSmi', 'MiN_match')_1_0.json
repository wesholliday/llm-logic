We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' together with 'The book might not be resting on the table', can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that it is on the table.  Therefore, we can't definitively conclude the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The book might not be resting on the table', can we infer 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's possible it's not true. This directly implies that it's not necessarily true or \"must\" be true.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
