If one option of an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other must be true.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n* **Premise 2:** The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\nHere, the second premise introduces uncertainty. Just because it *might not* be blending in doesn't mean it's definitely not.  We can't definitively say the piece is in the box.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\nSaying something *might not* happen is different from saying it's definitely *not* happening. We cannot infer the stronger statement.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
