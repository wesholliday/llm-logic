While the remote might not be under the couch, it doesn't definitively rule it out. Therefore, we can't definitively say it's on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nThis premise implies the remote could be somewhere else. It doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of it being under the couch. \n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
