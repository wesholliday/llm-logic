            "content": "**Question 1:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. \n\nThis is a classic disjunctive syllogism. If one part of an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other part must be true. Since the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, it must be in the living room.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n* **Premise 2:** The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nHere, the second premise only introduces possibility, not certainty.  The phone *might* not be ringing in the kitchen, but it still could be. This doesn't definitively tell us the phone is in the living room.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nAgain, this statement only expresses possibility. Saying the phone *might not* be ringing in the kitchen doesn't rule out the possibility that it *must* be ringing there. \n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
