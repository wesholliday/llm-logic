We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty. While it suggests the milk might be elsewhere, it doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of it being in the fridge. \n\n**Question 3: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's not definitely or necessarily true. \n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
