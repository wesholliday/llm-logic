We have two options presented, and one is ruled out. This leaves only one remaining possibility.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that it IS hanging in the closet.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** If something \"might not\" be the case, it means it's not absolutely certain. This implies that it's not a necessity. \n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
