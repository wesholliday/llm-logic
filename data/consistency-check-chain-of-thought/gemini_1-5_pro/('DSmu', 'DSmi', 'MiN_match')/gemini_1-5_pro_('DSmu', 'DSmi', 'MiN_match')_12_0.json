This doesn't definitively tell us the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nSaying the toy \"might not\" be on the bookshelf means it's possible it's NOT on the bookshelf. This is the same as saying \"it's not the case that the toy MUST be on the bookshelf.\"\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
