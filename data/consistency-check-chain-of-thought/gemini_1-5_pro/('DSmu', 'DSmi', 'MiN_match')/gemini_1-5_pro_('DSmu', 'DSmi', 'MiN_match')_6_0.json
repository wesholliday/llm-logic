            "content": "**Question 1:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. \n\nThis is a classic disjunctive syllogism. If one option in an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other must be true. Since the umbrella doesn't *have* to be in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n* **Premise 2:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\nHere, the second premise only introduces possibility.  Just because the umbrella *might not* be in the closet doesn't automatically mean it's in the car. It could be somewhere else entirely.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\nSaying something \"might not\" happen is different from saying it's definitely *not* the case. The umbrella could still be in the closet even if there's a possibility of it being elsewhere.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
