We have two options (either/or), and we're told one option is false. This means the other option must be true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Saying \"might not\" introduces uncertainty.  While it's possible the watch isn't on his wrist, it doesn't definitively rule it out. Therefore, we can't definitively say the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's not necessarily true in all cases, implying it's not a certainty (\"must\").\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
