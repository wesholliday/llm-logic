This doesn't rule out the possibility that Fido *is* in the garden. \n* Therefore, we can't definitively say Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n* If Fido *might not* be in the garden, it means there's a possibility he's not there. \n* This directly implies that it's not absolutely certain that Fido *must* be in the garden.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
