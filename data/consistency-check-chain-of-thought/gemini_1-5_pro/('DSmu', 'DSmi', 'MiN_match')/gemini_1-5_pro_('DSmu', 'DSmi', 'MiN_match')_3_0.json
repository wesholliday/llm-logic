            "content": "**Question 1: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** This is a classic application of disjunctive syllogism. We have two options, and one is ruled out. This leaves us with the other option.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The statement \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\" doesn't definitively rule out the cat being in the bedroom. It just introduces uncertainty. Therefore, we can't definitively say the cat is on the couch.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** If something \"might not\" be the case, then it's certainly not a certainty.  So, if the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, then it's not necessarily true that the cat MUST be playing in the bedroom.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
