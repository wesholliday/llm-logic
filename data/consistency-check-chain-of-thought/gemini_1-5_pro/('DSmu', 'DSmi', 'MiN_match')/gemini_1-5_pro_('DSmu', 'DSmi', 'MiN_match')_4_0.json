We have two options (cookies in jar or pantry), and we eliminate one (not in the pantry). This leaves only one valid option.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" doesn't definitively rule out the pantry. The cookies could still be there. \n\n**Question 3: From 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be the case, it means it's not definitely necessary.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
