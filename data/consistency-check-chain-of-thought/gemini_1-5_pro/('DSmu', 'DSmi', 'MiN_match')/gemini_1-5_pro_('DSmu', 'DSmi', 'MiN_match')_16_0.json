While the scarf might not be on the coat rack, it doesn't definitively rule it out. The scarf could still be on the coat rack.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\n* **Premise:** The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\nSaying something \"might not\" happen doesn't mean it *can't* happen. The scarf could still be on the coat rack.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, no** \n"
