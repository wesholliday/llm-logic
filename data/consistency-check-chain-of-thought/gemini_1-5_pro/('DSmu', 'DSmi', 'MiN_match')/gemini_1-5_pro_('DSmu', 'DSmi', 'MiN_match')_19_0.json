We have two options (either/or), and we eliminate one. This forces the other option to be true.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \"Might not\" introduces uncertainty. While it's possible the sunglasses aren't on her head, it doesn't definitively rule it out.  We can't definitively conclude they are in her bag.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Yes, these statements are logically equivalent. If something \"might not\" be true, it means it's not necessarily true, which is the same as saying it's not the case that it \"must\" be true.\n\n**Answer: yes, no, yes** \n"
