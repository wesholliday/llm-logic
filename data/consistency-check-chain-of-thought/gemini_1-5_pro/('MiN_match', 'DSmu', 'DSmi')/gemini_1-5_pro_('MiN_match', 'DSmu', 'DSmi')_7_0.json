This means it's not certain that the remote *must* be there. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' together with 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two possibilities, and told the second possibility is false.  This leaves only one remaining possibility: the remote is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' together with 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch', can we infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The second statement tells us the remote might not be under the couch, but it doesn't rule it out completely.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the remote is on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
