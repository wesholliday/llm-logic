This directly means it's not guaranteed or necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two pieces of information:\n    * The pen is either in the bag or must be on the desk.\n    * We know the pen doesn't *have* to be on the desk. \n    * This eliminates the second option, leaving only one possibility: the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  \n    * We know the pen is either in the bag or must be on the desk.\n    * We're told the pen *might not* be on the desk. This introduces uncertainty but doesn't definitively rule out the pen being on the desk. \n    * Therefore, we can't definitively say the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
