This means it's not absolutely certain the book IS on the table. Therefore, it's not the case that the book MUST be on the table.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' together with 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table', can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?**\n\nReasoning: We're given two pieces of information:\n    * The book is either on the shelf OR it must be on the table.\n    * It's NOT the case that the book must be on the table. \n\nSince the second statement eliminates the \"must be on the table\" option, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that \"the book is on the shelf.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' together with 'The book might not be resting on the table', can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?**\n\nReasoning: We're given:\n    * The book is either on the shelf OR it must be on the table.\n    * The book MIGHT NOT be on the table.\n\nThe second statement introduces uncertainty. While it might not be on the table, it also doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that it IS on the table.  Therefore, we can't definitively conclude that \"the book is on the shelf.\"\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
