This directly implies that it's not absolutely certain or necessary (\"must\") for it to be true. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\nReasoning: We're given two possibilities, and told the second one is false.  This leaves only the first possibility as true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\nReasoning: While we know the scarf might not be on the coat rack, it doesn't definitively rule out that possibility. The scarf could still be on the coat rack, even if it's not a certainty. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
