            "content": "**Question 1: From 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'?**\n\nReasoning: Yes. \"Might not\" implies a possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet. This directly contradicts the statement that the umbrella \"must\" be in the closet. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\nReasoning: Yes. We are given two possibilities, and told the second possibility is false.  This means the first possibility must be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\nReasoning: No. While the second statement suggests the umbrella might not be in the closet, it doesn't rule out that possibility.  We are left with at least one, and possibly both, of the original options still potentially true. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
