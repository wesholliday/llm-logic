If there's a possibility it's not on his wrist, then it's not guaranteed (\"must\") to be on his wrist.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  We're given two possibilities, and told the second possibility is false.  This leaves only the first possibility, which must be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  While \"might not\" weakens the second possibility, it doesn't eliminate it. The watch could still be on his wrist, even if it's not guaranteed. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
