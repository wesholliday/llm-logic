            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" means it's possible they are not in the pantry. This is the same as saying \"It's not necessarily true that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"  So the inference is valid.\n\n**Question 2:** We're given that the cookies are either in the jar or the pantry. We're also told it's not the case they *must* be in the pantry. This eliminates the pantry as the only option, leaving the jar.\n\n**Question 3:**  \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" doesn't definitively rule out the pantry. It just means it's not a certainty.  We don't have enough information to conclude the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
