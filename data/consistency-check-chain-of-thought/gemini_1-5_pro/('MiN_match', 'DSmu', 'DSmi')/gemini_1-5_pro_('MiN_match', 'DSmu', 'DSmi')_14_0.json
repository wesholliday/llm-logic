            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\" implies that it's possible they are not lined up. This is the same as saying \"It's not necessarily true that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"  Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\n**Question 2:** We are given that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door. We are also given that the shoes are NOT lined up by the door.  Since there's only one other option, the shoes must be in the closet.\n\n**Question 3:**  \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\" doesn't give us enough information. While it allows for the possibility that the shoes are in the closet, it doesn't rule out them being somewhere else besides the closet or by the door. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
