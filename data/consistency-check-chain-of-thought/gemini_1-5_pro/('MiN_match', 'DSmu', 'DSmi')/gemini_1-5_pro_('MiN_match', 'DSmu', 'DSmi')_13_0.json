This directly implies that it's not necessarily true (or \"must be\") chilling in the fridge. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of them.  Since the milk doesn't *have* to be in the fridge, the only remaining possibility is that it's on the counter.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The second statement tells us the milk might not be in the fridge, but it doesn't rule out the possibility.  We still have two possibilities, so we can't definitively say the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
