            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" implies that it's possible the sock isn't there. This is the same as saying \"It's not necessarily true that the sock must be under the bed.\" So the answer to Question 1 is yes.\n\n**Question 2:** We're given that the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. We're also given that it's not under the bed.  This eliminates the second option, leaving only the laundry basket. So the answer to Question 2 is yes.\n\n**Question 3:**  We're told the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. However, \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" doesn't rule out the possibility that it IS under the bed.  We don't have enough information to conclude it's in the laundry basket. So the answer to Question 3 is no.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
