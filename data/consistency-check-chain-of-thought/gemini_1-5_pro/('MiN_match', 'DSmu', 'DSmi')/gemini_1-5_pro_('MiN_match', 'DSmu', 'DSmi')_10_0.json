If it's possible the newspaper isn't on the porch, then it's not guaranteed (\"must\") to be on the porch. \n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch' together with 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:** We're given two possibilities, and told the second possibility is false.  This leaves only the first possibility, which must be true.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch' together with 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway'?**\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The second statement tells us the newspaper might not be on the porch, but it doesn't rule it out completely.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
