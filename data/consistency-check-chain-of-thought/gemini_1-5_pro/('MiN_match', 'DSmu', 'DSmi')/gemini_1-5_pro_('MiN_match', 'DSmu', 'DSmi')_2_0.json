            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that it's possible they are not there. This is the same as saying \"It's not the case that the keys MUST be dangling in the cabinet\". So the answer is yes.\n\n**Question 2:** We are given that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet. We are also given that they are NOT dangling in the cabinet.  This leaves only one possibility: the keys must be in the drawer. So the answer is yes.\n\n**Question 3:**  We are told the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet.  However, \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" doesn't rule out the possibility that they ARE dangling in the cabinet.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the keys are in the drawer. So the answer is no.\n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
