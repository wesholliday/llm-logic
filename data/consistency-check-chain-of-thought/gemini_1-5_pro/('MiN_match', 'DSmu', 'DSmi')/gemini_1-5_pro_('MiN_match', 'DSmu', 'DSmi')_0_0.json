            "content": "**Reasoning:**\n\n**Question 1:** \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means it's possible Fido is not in the garden. This directly contradicts the statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which means Fido is not obligated to be in the garden. \n\n**Question 2:** We're given that either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden. We're also given that it's not the case Fido must be in the garden.  Since one of these two options must be true, and we've eliminated the garden, Fido must be inside.\n\n**Question 3:** \"Fido might not be in the garden\" doesn't definitively tell us where Fido is. While we know either Fido is inside or in the garden, the possibility that he's not in the garden doesn't automatically mean he's inside. \n\n**Answer: yes, yes, no** \n"
