It only indicates a possibility.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively infer 'The phone is in the living room' based on the given information.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen', can we infer 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen'?**\n\n- 'The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen' means that it is possible that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n- If it is possible that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it cannot be necessarily true that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen' together with 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen', can we infer 'The phone is in the living room'?**\n\n- 'Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen' means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen' means that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen.\n- Given that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining option is that the phone is in the living room.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The phone is in the living room'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
