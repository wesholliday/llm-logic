This implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n- \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n- If it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, then the only way to satisfy the first statement is if Fido is inside.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n- \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n- If it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n- \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n- If it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden, then the first statement can only be satisfied if Fido is inside.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
