This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n- \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be on the bookshelf.\n- \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- If it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box to satisfy the first statement.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'?**\n\n- \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- If it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n- \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be on the bookshelf.\n- \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf.\n- If it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf, then it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- However, this does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the toy box, as the toy could be somewhere else entirely.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
