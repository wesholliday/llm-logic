Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'The watch might not be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n- 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' means one of these two conditions must be true.\n- 'The watch might not be on his wrist' means there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n- If the watch might not be on his wrist, it does not necessarily mean it is charging on the dresser. It only means that it is possible for the watch to be somewhere else other than his wrist. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\n**Question 3: From 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch might not be on his wrist'?**\n\n- 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist' means it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist.\n- 'The watch might not be on his wrist' means there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n- If it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist, then it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist. Therefore, we can infer that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' together with 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist', can we infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'?**\n\n- 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' means one of these two conditions must be true.\n- 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist' means it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist.\n- If it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the watch is charging on the dresser. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Answer: Yes, No, Yes, Yes**",
