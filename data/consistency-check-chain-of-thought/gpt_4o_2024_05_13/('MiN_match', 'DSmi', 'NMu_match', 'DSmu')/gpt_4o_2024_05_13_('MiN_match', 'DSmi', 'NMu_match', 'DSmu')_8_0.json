This implies that it is not necessarily true that the piece must be blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor'.\n\n**Question 2:**\nFrom 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?\n\n- The statement 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. The statement 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor' suggests that it is possible that the piece is not blending in on the floor, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that it is blending in on the floor. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the piece is in the box based on these statements.\n\n**Question 3:**\nFrom 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor'?\n\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor' means that it is not necessarily true that the piece is blending in on the floor. This implies that there is a possibility that the piece is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can infer 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor'.\n\n**Question 4:**\nFrom 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?\n\n- The statement 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' means that one of these two conditions must be true. The statement 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor' rules out the second condition. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
