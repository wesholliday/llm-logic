            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Can we infer: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\"?\n- Reasoning: If something \"might not\" be true, it implies that it is not necessarily true. Therefore, if the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, it is not the case that it must be hiding under the couch.\n- Answer: Yes.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Can we infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table\"?\n- Reasoning: The first statement gives us two possibilities: the remote is either on the coffee table or it must be under the couch. The second statement tells us that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that it is on the coffee table.\n- Answer: Yes.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Can we infer: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\"?\n- Reasoning: If it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, it means that it is possible that it is not under the couch. Therefore, the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n- Answer: Yes.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Can we infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table\"?\n- Reasoning: The first statement gives us two possibilities: the remote is either on the coffee table or it must be under the couch. The second statement tells us that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that it is on the coffee table.\n- Answer: Yes.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
