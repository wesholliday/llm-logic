            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either A (keys are in the drawer) or B (keys must be dangling in the cabinet). The second statement suggests that B is not necessarily true (the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet). However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A is true based on these statements.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, it implies that there is a possibility that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either A (keys are in the drawer) or B (keys must be dangling in the cabinet). The second statement negates B. If B is not true, then A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it means there is a possibility that they are not there. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
