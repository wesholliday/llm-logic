Statement 2 suggests that B (hiding under the couch) is not necessarily true. However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A (on the coffee table) is true.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the remote control is hiding under the couch, it implies that there is a possibility it is not there. Therefore, we can infer that it might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B). Statement 2 negates B (hiding under the couch). If B is negated, then A (on the coffee table) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, it implies that it is not necessarily true that it must be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
