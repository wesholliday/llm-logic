Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the umbrella is not in the closet. This means the second part of Statement 1 (\"it must be tucked away in the closet\") is not necessarily true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from Statement 1 is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the umbrella must be in the closet, then it is possible that the umbrella is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, or it must be in the closet. Statement 2 tells us that it is not necessarily true that the umbrella must be in the closet. This eliminates the second possibility from Statement 1, leaving us with the conclusion that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is possible that the umbrella is not in the closet, then it cannot be necessarily true that the umbrella must be in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
