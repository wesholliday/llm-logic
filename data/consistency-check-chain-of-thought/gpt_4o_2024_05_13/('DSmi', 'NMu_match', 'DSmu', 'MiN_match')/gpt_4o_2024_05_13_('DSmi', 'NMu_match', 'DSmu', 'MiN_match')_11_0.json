            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Additional information: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, which means B is not necessarily true. If B is not necessarily true, then A (the jacket is draped over the chair) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Analysis: This statement means that it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This aligns with the idea that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Additional information: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates B (the jacket must be hanging in the closet). If B is negated, then A (the jacket is draped over the chair) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Analysis: This statement means that it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
