Therefore, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 3: From 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen might not be on my desk'?**\n\n- \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" means that it is not necessarily true that the pen is on the desk.\n- If it is not necessarily true that the pen is on the desk, then it is possible that the pen might not be on the desk. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" can be written as \\( P \\lor M \\).\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" can be written as \\( \\neg M \\).\n- Given \\( P \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination to infer \\( P \\). Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
