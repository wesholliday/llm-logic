            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement suggests that B (keys dangling in the cabinet) is not necessarily true. However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A (keys are in the drawer) is true based on these statements.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it implies that it is not a certainty that they must be there. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, it means there is a possibility that they are not there. Therefore, we can infer that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement negates B (keys must be dangling in the cabinet). If B is negated, then A (keys are in the drawer) must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
