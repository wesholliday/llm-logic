            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Additional information: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively state that the book is not on the table. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf based on the given information.\n- Conclusion: No.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: If the book might not be resting on the table, it means that it is not necessarily true that the book must be resting on the table. This directly supports the inference.\n- Conclusion: Yes.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: If it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table, it implies that there is a possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. This directly supports the inference.\n- Conclusion: Yes.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Additional information: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates B (the book must be resting on the table). By the rule of disjunction elimination, if one part of the disjunction is false, the other part must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n- Conclusion: Yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
