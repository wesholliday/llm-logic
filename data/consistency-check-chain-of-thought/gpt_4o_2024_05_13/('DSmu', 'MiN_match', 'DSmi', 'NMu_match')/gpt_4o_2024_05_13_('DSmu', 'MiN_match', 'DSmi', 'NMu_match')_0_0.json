The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is 'Fido is inside' and \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( \\neg B \\).\n3. Using the rule of disjunction elimination, if \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( \\neg B \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests that it is possible for Fido to be somewhere other than the garden.\n2. The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n3. If it is possible for Fido to be somewhere else, then it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( A \\lor B \\).\n2. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests that it is possible for Fido to be somewhere other than the garden, but it does not provide a definitive statement about \\( B \\).\n3. Since 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not definitively negate \\( B \\), we cannot conclude \\( A \\) based on \\( A \\lor B \\).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?**\n\n1. The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n2. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that it is possible for Fido to be somewhere other than the garden.\n3. If it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden, then it is possible for Fido to be somewhere else.\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
