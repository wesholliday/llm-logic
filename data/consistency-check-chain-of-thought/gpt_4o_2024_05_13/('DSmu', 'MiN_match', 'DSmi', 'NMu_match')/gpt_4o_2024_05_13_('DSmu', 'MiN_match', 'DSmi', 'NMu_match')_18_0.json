Given Premise 1, if the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Premise:** The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\n\"Might not\" implies that it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist, but it does not definitively state that it is not on his wrist. \n\n**Conclusion:** No, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the watch must be on his wrist, because \"might not\" does not provide certainty.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Premise 1:** Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n- **Premise 2:** The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\n\"Might not\" implies a possibility but not a certainty. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Conclusion:** No, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n### Question 4:\n- **Premise:** It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nIf it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist, it implies that there is a possibility that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\n**Answer:** yes, no, no, yes",
