            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the jacket must be hanging in the closet). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, it means there is a possibility that it is not in the closet. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the jacket being in the closet, but it does not negate the possibility that it must be in the closet. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair based on these statements alone.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, it means there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet. This implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
