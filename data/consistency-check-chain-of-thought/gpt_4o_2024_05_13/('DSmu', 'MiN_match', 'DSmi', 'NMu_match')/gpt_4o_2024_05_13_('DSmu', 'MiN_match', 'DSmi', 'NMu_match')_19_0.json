            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag, or they must be perched on her head. Statement 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with the conclusion that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, it means there is a possibility that they are not on her head. This implies that it is not necessarily true that they must be on her head. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag, or they must be perched on her head. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the sunglasses being on her head but does not definitively rule it out. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, it means there is a possibility that they are not on her head. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
