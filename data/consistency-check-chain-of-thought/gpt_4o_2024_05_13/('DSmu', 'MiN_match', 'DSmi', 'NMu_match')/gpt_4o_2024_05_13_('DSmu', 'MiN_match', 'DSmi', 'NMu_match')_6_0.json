Statement 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with the conclusion that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet, it means there is a possibility that it is not in the closet. This implies that it is not necessarily the case that the umbrella must be in the closet.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the umbrella being in the closet but does not definitively rule it out. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet, it means there is no necessity for it to be in the closet. This implies that there is a possibility (or might) that it is not in the closet.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Final Answers:**\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
