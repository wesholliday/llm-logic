            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This is a logical disjunction (A or B).\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This is the negation of B (\u00acB).\n\nGiven A or B and \u00acB, we can use the rule of disjunction elimination:\n- If A or B is true and B is false, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the milk is not chilling in the fridge (\u00acB is possible).\n\nThe statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" does not necessarily mean \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" (\u00acB). It only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This is a logical disjunction (A or B).\n- Statement 2: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the milk is not chilling in the fridge (\u00acB is possible).\n\nGiven A or B and the possibility of \u00acB, we cannot definitively conclude A. The possibility of \u00acB does not provide enough information to eliminate B and confirm A.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This is the negation of B (\u00acB).\n\nIf it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, it implies that there is a possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\n### Summary:\n- Question 1: Yes\n- Question 2: No\n- Question 3: No\n- Question 4: Yes\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
