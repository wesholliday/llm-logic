            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be on the nightstand. Statement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the notebook does not have to be on the nightstand. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it means there is a possibility that it is not there. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the notebook must be on the nightstand. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be on the nightstand. Statement 2 suggests that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, which means it is not necessarily true that it must be on the nightstand. This leaves the possibility that the notebook is in the drawer. However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out the nightstand, so we cannot conclusively infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the notebook must be on the nightstand, then it is possible that the notebook might not be on the nightstand. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
