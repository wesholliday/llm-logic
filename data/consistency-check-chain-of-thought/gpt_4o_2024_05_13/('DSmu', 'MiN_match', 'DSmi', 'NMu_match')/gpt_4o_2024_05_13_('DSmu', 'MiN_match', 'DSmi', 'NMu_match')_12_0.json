            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box, or it must be on the bookshelf. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the toy must be on the bookshelf). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box. So, the answer is yes.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf the toy might not be on the bookshelf, it means there is a possibility that it is not on the bookshelf. This directly implies that it is not necessarily the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf. So, the answer is yes.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box, or it must be on the bookshelf. Statement 2 indicates that the toy might not be on the bookshelf, which means it is not necessarily on the bookshelf. This does not directly confirm that the toy is in the toy box, as it only suggests a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box. So, the answer is no.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, it means there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy might not be on the bookshelf. So, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
