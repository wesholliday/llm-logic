Premise 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Premise: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe phrase \"might not\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. This means that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not definitively state that it is not there.\n\n**Conclusion:** No, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" from \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n### Question 3:\n- Premise 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Premise 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nPremise 1 gives us two possibilities. Premise 2 introduces uncertainty about one of those possibilities but does not eliminate it. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these premises.\n\n**Conclusion:** No, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Premise: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the remote control to be hiding under the couch, then it is possible that it might not be hiding under the couch. This aligns with the statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n**Answer:** yes, no, no, yes",
