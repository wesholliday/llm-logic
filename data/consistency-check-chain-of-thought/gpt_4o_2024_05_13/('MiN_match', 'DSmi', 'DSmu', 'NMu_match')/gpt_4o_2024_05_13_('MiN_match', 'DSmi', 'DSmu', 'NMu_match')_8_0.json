Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\n**Question 4: From 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor'?**\n\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" means that it is not necessarily true that the piece is blending in on the floor.\n- The statement \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" suggests a possibility that it is not blending in on the floor.\n- Since \"not necessarily true\" implies that there is a possibility it is not blending in, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
