            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the watch is charging on the dresser\" and B is \"it must be on his wrist.\" The second statement suggests that it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist, but it does not definitively state that the watch is not on his wrist. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based on the possibility alone.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates B (\"it must be on his wrist\"). If B is false, then A (\"the watch is charging on the dresser\") must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n\nThis statement indicates a possibility, not a certainty. It means that it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist. This aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist,\" which also indicates that it is not necessarily true that the watch is on his wrist. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
