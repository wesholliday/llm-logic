Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"the notebook is in the drawer\" and \\( B \\) is \"the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it doesn't definitively state that it is not there. This does not provide a definitive negation of \\( B \\).\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer because the second statement does not provide a definitive negation of \\( B \\). It only suggests a possibility.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use disjunctive syllogism to infer \\( A \\). Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not definitively state that it is not there.\n\nFrom the statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand,\" we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand. Therefore, we can conclude \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
