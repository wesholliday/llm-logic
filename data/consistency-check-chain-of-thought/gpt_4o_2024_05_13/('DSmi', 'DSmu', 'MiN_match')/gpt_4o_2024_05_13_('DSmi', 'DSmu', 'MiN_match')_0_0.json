            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Statement 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n  - This means if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n- Statement 2: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n  - This means it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nTo infer \"Fido is inside,\" we need to show that the only possibility left is that Fido is inside. However, \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n  - This means if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n  - This means Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\nGiven that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, the only remaining option from the first statement is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n  - This means it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we need to show that it is not a necessity for Fido to be in the garden. Since \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates that there is a possibility Fido is not in the garden, it implies that it is not a necessity for Fido to be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
