Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A is true based on these statements.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates B (\"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\"). If B is false, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that A is true.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that it is possible that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, but it does not definitively state that it is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" from this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
