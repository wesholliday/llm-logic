            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either the toy is in the toy box (A) or it must be on the bookshelf (B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which means B is not necessarily true. If B is not necessarily true, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nThe statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This directly implies that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either the toy is in the toy box (A) or it must be on the bookshelf (B). The second statement negates B, meaning it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. If B is not true, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
