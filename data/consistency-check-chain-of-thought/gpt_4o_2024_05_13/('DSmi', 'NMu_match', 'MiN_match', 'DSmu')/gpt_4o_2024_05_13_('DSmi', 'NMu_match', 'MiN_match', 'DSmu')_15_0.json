Therefore, we can infer that the pen might not be on the desk.\n\n**Question 3: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n- The statement \"The pen might not be on my desk\" suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk, then it cannot be the case that the pen must be on the desk. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" can be written as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the pen is in my bag\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pen must be on my desk\".\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" can be written as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n- Given \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), by disjunctive syllogism, we can infer \\( P \\). Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
