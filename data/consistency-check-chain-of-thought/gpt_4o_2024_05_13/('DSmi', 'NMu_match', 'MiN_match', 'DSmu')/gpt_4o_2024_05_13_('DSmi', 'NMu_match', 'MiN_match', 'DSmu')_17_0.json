            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Additional information: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that B (the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand) is not necessarily true. However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on the given information.\n- Conclusion: No.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Analysis: This directly negates the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand. If it is not necessarily on the nightstand, it implies that there is a possibility that it might not be on the nightstand.\n- Conclusion: Yes.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Analysis: This suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. If there is a possibility that it is not on the nightstand, then it cannot be the case that it must be on the nightstand.\n- Conclusion: Yes.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Additional information: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates B (the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand). If B is false, then A (the notebook is in the drawer) must be true.\n- Conclusion: Yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
