            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Premise 1:** Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- **Premise 2:** Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nThe first premise is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\" (A = Fido is inside, B = Fido must be in the garden). The second premise states that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" which means it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. This does not definitively rule out the possibility that Fido is in the garden, but it does not confirm it either. Given that one of the disjuncts (B) is not necessarily true, the other disjunct (A) must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Premise:** It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nThis premise states that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden. If it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden, then it is possible that Fido might not be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Premise:** Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nThis premise states that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. If it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\n### Question 4:\n- **Premise 1:** Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nThe first premise is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\" (A = Fido is inside, B = Fido must be in the garden). The second premise states that B is false (It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden). Given that one of the disjuncts (B) is false, the other disjunct (A) must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
