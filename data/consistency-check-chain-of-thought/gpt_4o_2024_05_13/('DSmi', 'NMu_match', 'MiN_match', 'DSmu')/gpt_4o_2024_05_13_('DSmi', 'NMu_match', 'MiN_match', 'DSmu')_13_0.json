            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Additional information: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk is on the counter.\n- Conclusion: No, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Analysis: This statement means that it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge, which implies that there is a possibility that the milk might not be in the fridge.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Analysis: This statement indicates a possibility, not a certainty. If there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, it means that it is not necessarily true that the milk must be in the fridge.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Additional information: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates the necessity of B (the milk must be chilling in the fridge). If B is not necessarily true, then A (the milk is on the counter) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
