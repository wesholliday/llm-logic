            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not definitively rule out that they are in the cabinet. Since the second statement does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not necessary for the keys to be in the cabinet. This implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it means there is a possibility that they are not there. This implies that it is not a necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet (not B). If B is not necessarily true, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
