            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be on the nightstand. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (it must be on the nightstand). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nStatement 1 gives us two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be on the nightstand. Statement 2 says the notebook might not be on the nightstand, which means it is possible that it is not on the nightstand, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that it is on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand, then it is possible that it is not on the nightstand. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it means there is a possibility that it is not on the nightstand. This implies that it is not a necessity for the notebook to be on the nightstand. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
