Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the pen must be on the desk). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag. \n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the pen is in the bag or it must be on the desk. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the pen being on the desk (it might not be on the desk). However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the pen must be on the desk. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk, it means that it is possible for the pen to be somewhere else. This implies that there is a possibility (might) that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the pen might not be on the desk, it means that it is not certain that the pen must be on the desk. Therefore, it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Final Answers:**\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
