            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. Given Statement 1, if the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf, the only other option is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nStatement 2 indicates a possibility but not a certainty. The toy might not be on the bookshelf, but it also might be. This does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Hence, we can infer that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nThis statement indicates a possibility but not a certainty. If the toy might not be on the bookshelf, it means that it is not necessarily on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
