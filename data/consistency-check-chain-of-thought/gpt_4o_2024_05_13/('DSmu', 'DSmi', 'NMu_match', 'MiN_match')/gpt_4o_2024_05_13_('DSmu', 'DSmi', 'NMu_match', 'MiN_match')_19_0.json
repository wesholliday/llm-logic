            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag, or they must be perched on her head. Statement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag, or they must be perched on her head. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the sunglasses being perched on her head but does not definitively rule it out. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf it's not necessary for the sunglasses to be perched on her head, it implies that there is a possibility they might not be perched on her head. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, it means that it is not a certainty that they must be perched on her head. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
