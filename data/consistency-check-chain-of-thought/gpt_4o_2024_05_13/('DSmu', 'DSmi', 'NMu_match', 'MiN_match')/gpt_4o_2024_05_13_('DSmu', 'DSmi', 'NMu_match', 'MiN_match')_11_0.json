            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the jacket must be hanging in the closet). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nStatement 1 gives us two possibilities: the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the jacket being in the closet but does not definitively negate it. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, then it is possible (might be the case) that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This inference is valid.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it cannot be a necessity that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This inference is also valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
