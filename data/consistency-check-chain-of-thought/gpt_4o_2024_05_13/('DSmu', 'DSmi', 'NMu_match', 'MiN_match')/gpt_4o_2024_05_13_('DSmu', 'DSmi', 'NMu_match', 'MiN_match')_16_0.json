Statement 2 negates the possibility that the scarf must be on the coat rack. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nStatement 1 presents two possibilities: the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the scarf being on the coat rack but does not definitively rule it out. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\n**Inference:** No, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the scarf to be on the coat rack. This implies that there is a possibility that the scarf might not be on the coat rack.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nThis statement indicates a possibility but does not definitively rule out the scarf being on the coat rack. Therefore, it does not necessarily imply that it is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\n**Inference:** No, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\n**Answer:** yes, no, yes, no",
