            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the milk must be chilling in the fridge). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nStatement 1 gives us two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the milk chilling in the fridge (it might not be). However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the milk to be chilling in the fridge, it implies that there is a possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, it means that it is not a certainty that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
