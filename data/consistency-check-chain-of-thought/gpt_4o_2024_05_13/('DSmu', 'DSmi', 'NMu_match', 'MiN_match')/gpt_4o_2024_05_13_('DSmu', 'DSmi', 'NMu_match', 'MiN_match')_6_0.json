The umbrella is in the car.\n2. The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with only the first possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nStatement 1 again gives us two possibilities:\n1. The umbrella is in the car.\n2. The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not negate it. \"Might not\" means it is possible that the umbrella is not in the closet, but it does not confirm it. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the umbrella to be in the closet, then it is possible (might) that it is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is possible that the umbrella is not in the closet, then it cannot be a necessity for it to be in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
