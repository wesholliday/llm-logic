            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that the book is not necessarily on the table. Given Statement 1, if the book is not necessarily on the table, the only other option is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nStatement 2 indicates that it is possible the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the book is on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf based on these statements.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the book to be on the table. If it is not necessary, then it is possible that the book might not be on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThis statement means that it is possible the book is not on the table. If it is possible that the book is not on the table, then it is not necessarily true that the book must be on the table. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
