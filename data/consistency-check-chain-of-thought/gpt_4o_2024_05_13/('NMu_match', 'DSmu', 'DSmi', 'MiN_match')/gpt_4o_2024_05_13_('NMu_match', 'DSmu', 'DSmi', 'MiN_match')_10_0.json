This implies that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch' together with 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n- Given \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch,\" we know that the second condition is false.\n- Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch' together with 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\" means one of these conditions must be true.\n- \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\" means it is possible that the newspaper is not on the porch, but it does not confirm it.\n- Since \"might not\" does not definitively rule out the possibility of the newspaper being on the porch, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch', can we infer 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch'?**\n\n- \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\" indicates that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n- If there is a possibility that the newspaper is not on the porch, then it cannot be the case that the newspaper must be on the porch.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
