This implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that at least one of these two conditions is true.\n- Given \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we know that the second condition is false.\n- Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that at least one of these two conditions is true.\n- \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden.\n- Since \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n- \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- If there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
