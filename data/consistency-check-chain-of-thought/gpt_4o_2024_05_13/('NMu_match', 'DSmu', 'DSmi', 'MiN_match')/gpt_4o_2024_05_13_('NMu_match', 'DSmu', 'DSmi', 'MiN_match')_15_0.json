This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" negates the second condition.\n- Since the second condition is negated, the first condition \"The pen is in my bag\" must be true.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, but it does not definitively negate the second condition.\n- Since the second condition is not definitively negated, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n- Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk, then it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
