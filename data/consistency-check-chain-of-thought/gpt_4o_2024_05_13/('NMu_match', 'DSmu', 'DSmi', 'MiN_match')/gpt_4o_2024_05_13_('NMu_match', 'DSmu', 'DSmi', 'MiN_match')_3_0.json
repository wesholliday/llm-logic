This implies that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom' negates the second condition of the disjunction.\n- Since the second condition is negated, the first condition 'The cat is napping on the couch' must be true.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' is a disjunction.\n- The statement 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom' indicates that it is possible that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but it does not definitively negate the second condition.\n- Since the second condition is not definitively negated, we cannot conclusively infer that the first condition 'The cat is napping on the couch' is true.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom'?**\n\n- The statement 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom' indicates that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n- This implies that it is not necessarily true that the cat is playing in the bedroom.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
