            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\nStatement: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\nInference: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n- The original statement negates the necessity of the cookies being hidden in the pantry. This means that it is possible for the cookies to be somewhere else.\n- Therefore, it is correct to infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\nStatements: \n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nInference: \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the cookies being hidden in the pantry.\n- Since the second condition (must be hidden in the pantry) is negated, the first condition (the cookies are in the jar) must be true.\n\n**Question 3:**\nStatements:\n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n2. \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nInference: \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n- The second statement indicates a possibility but does not definitively negate the necessity of the cookies being hidden in the pantry.\n- Since the second statement does not provide a definitive negation, we cannot conclusively infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Question 4:**\nStatement: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\nInference: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n- The original statement indicates a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n- This implies that it is not necessary for the cookies to be hidden in the pantry.\n- Therefore, it is correct to infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
