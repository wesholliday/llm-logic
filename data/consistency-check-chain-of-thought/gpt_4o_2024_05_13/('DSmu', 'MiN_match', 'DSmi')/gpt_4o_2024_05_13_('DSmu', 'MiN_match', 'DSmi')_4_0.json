            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( C \\lor M \\) where \\( C \\) is \"cookies are in the jar\" and \\( M \\) is \"cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nGiven \\( C \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use disjunctive syllogism:\n- If \\( C \\lor M \\) is true and \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nSo, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box M \\) where \\( \\Box M \\) means \"the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nThe statement \\( \\neg \\Box M \\) directly translates to \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nSo, we can infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( C \\lor M \\).\n- Statement 2: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box M \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\neg \\Box M \\), we know that it's not necessarily true that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, but it doesn't provide a definitive answer about whether they are in the jar or not. It only tells us that \\( M \\) is not necessarily true, but \\( M \\) could still be true or false.\n\nGiven \\( C \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg \\Box M \\), we cannot definitively infer \\( C \\) (the cookies are in the jar) because \\( M \\) could still be true.\n\nSo, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
