            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"the toy is in the toy box\" and \\( B \\) is \"the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination:\n- If \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf,\" which can be written as \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nThe statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" does not definitively state that the toy is not on the bookshelf; it only suggests a possibility. However, \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" (\\( \\neg B \\)) is a stronger statement that definitively states the toy is not required to be on the bookshelf.\n\nSince \"might not\" implies a possibility and \"must not\" implies certainty, we cannot infer the stronger statement from the weaker one.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf,\" which can be written as \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and the possibility of \\( \\neg B \\), we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\). The possibility of \\( \\neg B \\) does not provide enough information to eliminate \\( B \\) as a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n### Summary:\n- For Question 1, the answer is \"yes.\"\n- For Question 2, the answer is \"no.\"\n- For Question 3, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
