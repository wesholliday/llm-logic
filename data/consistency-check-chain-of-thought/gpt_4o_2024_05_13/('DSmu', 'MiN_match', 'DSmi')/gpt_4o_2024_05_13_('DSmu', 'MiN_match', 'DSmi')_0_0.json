            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Premise 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- Premise 2: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden. Premise 2 negates one of these possibilities, specifically that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 1:** Yes, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n- Premise: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Fido might not be in the garden\" means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. This implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. If Fido must be in the garden, then there would be no possibility of Fido not being in the garden.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 2:** Yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n### Question 3:\n- Premise 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- Premise 2: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden. Premise 2 states that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, which means it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. However, this does not directly confirm that Fido is inside; it only negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside based on these premises alone.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 3:** No, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n**Answer:** yes, yes, no",
