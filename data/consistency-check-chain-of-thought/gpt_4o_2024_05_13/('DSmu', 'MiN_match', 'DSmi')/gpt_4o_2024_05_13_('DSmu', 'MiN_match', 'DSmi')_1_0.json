Premise 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not true that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 1:** Yes, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Premise: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThe phrase \"might not be\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. It means that it is possible that the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively state that the book is not on the table. However, if there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, it implies that it is not necessarily true that the book must be on the table.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 2:** Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Premise 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Premise 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Premise 2 introduces the possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the book must be on the table. Therefore, Premise 2 does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 3:** No, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Answer:** yes, yes, no",
