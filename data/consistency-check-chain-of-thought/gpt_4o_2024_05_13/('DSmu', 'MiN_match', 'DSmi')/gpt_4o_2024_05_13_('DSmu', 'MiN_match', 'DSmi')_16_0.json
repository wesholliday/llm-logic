            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" and \\( B \\) is \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use disjunctive syllogism:\n- If \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement:** \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack,\" which means \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nSince \"might not\" indicates possibility rather than certainty, it does not definitively state \\( \\neg B \\). However, it implies that \\( B \\) is not necessarily true. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" because \"must\" implies certainty, and \"might not\" implies that certainty does not hold.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack,\" which means \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and the possibility of \\( \\neg B \\), we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\). The possibility of \\( \\neg B \\) does not provide enough information to assert \\( A \\) with certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\n### Summary:\n- For Question 1, the answer is \"yes.\"\n- For Question 2, the answer is \"yes.\"\n- For Question 3, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
