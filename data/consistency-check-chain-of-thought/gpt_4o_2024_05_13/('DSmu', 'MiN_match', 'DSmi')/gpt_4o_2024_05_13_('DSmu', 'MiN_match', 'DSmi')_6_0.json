Therefore, if the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet, it means that it is not necessarily true that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nThus, we can infer \\( \\neg C \\).\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement 1:** Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n  - This can be written as: \\( U \\lor C \\).\n- **Statement 2:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n  - This can be interpreted as: It is possible that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, which can be written as: \\( \\neg C \\) is possible.\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \\( U \\) (the umbrella is in the car).\n\n- From \\( U \\lor C \\), we know that either \\( U \\) is true or \\( C \\) is true.\n- From the possibility that \\( \\neg C \\), we know that \\( C \\) is not necessarily true, but this does not provide definitive information about \\( U \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the umbrella is in the car based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
