It means that \\( B \\) is not necessarily true, but it does not confirm \\( \\neg B \\).\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively infer \\( \\neg B \\) from \"might not.\"\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand,\" which means \\( \\neg B \\) is possible but not certain.\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (\"The notebook is in the drawer\").\n\n- \"Might not\" (\\( \\neg B \\) is possible) does not provide certainty about \\( B \\) being false.\n- Since \\( \\neg B \\) is not certain, we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\) from \\( A \\lor B \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
