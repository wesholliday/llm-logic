It only suggests a possibility, not a definite conclusion.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- Statement 2: \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n  - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that the watch is not on his wrist,\" which means \\( \\neg B \\) is possible but not certain.\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and the possibility of \\( \\neg B \\), we do not have enough information to definitively conclude \\( A \\). The possibility of \\( \\neg B \\) does not eliminate \\( B \\) as a certainty, and thus does not confirm \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
