            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the keys are in the drawer, or they must be dangling in the cabinet. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the keys must be dangling in the cabinet). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, it means there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the keys are in the drawer, or they must be dangling in the cabinet. Statement 2 introduces the possibility that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that they are dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it means there is a possibility that they are not dangling in the cabinet. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
