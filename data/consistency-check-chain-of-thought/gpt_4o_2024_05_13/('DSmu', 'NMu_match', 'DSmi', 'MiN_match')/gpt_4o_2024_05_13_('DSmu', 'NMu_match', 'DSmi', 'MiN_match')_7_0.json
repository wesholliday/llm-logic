            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table.\n2. The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not true that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, it means there is a possibility that it is not hiding under the couch. This aligns with the statement that it might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table.\n2. The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out the second possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these statements alone.\n\n**Conclusion:** No, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, it means there is a possibility that it is not hiding under the couch. This aligns with the statement that it is not necessarily the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Answer:**\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
