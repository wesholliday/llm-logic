            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the book must be resting on the table). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the book to be resting on the table, then it is possible (might) that the book is not resting on the table. This is a straightforward inference.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the book is not resting on the table, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is possible that the book is not resting on the table, then it cannot be the case that the book must be resting on the table. This is a straightforward inference.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
