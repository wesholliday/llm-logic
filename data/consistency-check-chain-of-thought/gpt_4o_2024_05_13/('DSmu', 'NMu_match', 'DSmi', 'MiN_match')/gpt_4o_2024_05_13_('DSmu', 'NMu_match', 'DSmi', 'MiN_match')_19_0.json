            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: \n1. The sunglasses are in her bag.\n2. The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, it means there is a possibility that they are not perched on her head. This aligns with the statement that they might not be perched on her head.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The sunglasses are in her bag.\n2. The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nStatement 2 indicates that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, but it does not definitively rule out the second possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based on the given information.\n\n**Inference:** No, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, it means there is a possibility that they are not perched on her head. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n**Answer:** yes, yes, no, yes",
