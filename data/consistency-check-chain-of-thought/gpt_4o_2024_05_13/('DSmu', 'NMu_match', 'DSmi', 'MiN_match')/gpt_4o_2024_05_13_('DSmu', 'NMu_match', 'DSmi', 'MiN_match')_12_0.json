            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer if \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box or it must be on the bookshelf. Statement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer if \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf, then it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer if \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box or it must be on the bookshelf. Statement 2 suggests that it is possible for the toy not to be on the bookshelf, which aligns with the first possibility (the toy is in the toy box). Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer if \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf the toy might not be on the bookshelf, then it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
