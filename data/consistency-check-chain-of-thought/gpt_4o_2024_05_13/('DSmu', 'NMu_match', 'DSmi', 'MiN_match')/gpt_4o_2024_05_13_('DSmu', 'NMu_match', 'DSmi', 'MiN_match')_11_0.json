            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the jacket must be hanging in the closet). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the jacket to be hanging in the closet, then it is possible (i.e., it might be the case) that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it cannot be the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
