            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is 'Fido is inside' and \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( \\neg B \\).\n3. Using the rule of disjunction elimination, if \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( \\neg B \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?**\n\n1. The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( \\neg B \\), where \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. If \\( B \\) is false, it means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden.\n3. Therefore, it is possible that Fido might not be in the garden.\n4. Hence, we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is 'Fido is inside' and \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that it is possible that \\( \\neg B \\) is true.\n3. However, 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not provide a definitive truth value for \\( B \\); it only indicates a possibility.\n4. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer 'Fido is inside' from these statements.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that it is possible that \\( \\neg B \\) is true, where \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. If it is possible that \\( \\neg B \\) is true, then it cannot be the case that \\( B \\) is necessarily true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
