Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\n### Question 3:\nStatements:\n1. \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nInference: \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction: either the milk is on the counter, or it must be in the fridge.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge.\n\nIf it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge, then the second part of the disjunction is false. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
