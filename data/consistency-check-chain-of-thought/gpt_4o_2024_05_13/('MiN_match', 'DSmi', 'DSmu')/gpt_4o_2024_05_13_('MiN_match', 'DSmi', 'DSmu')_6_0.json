This implies that it is not a necessity for the umbrella to be in the closet.\n- Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' gives us two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, or it is necessarily in the closet.\n- The statement 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet' suggests that it is possible for the umbrella not to be in the closet, which aligns with the first possibility (the umbrella is in the car).\n- Given these two statements together, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' gives us two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, or it is necessarily in the closet.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet' negates the necessity of the umbrella being in the closet.\n- Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
