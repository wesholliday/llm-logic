This leaves the first possibility: the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' gives us two possibilities: the sock is in the laundry basket, or it is necessarily under the bed.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed' negates the necessity of the sock being under the bed.\n- Since the second possibility (the sock must be under the bed) is negated, we are left with the first possibility: the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Answer: Yes, Yes, Yes**",
