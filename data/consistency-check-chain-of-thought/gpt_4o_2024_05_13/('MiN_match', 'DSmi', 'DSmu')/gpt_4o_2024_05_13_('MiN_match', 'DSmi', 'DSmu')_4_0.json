            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1: From 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'?**\n\n- The statement 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This implies that it is not a certainty that the cookies are in the pantry.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' means that it is not necessary for the cookies to be in the pantry.\n- Since 'might not be' indicates a lack of necessity, we can infer that it is not required for the cookies to be in the pantry.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 1 is 'yes'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' presents two possibilities: the cookies are in the jar, or it is necessary for them to be in the pantry.\n- The statement 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' suggests that it is possible for the cookies to not be in the pantry, which means it is not necessary for them to be in the pantry.\n- Given that it is not necessary for the cookies to be in the pantry, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 2 is 'yes'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' together with 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry', can we infer 'The cookies are in the jar'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' again presents two possibilities: the cookies are in the jar, or it is necessary for them to be in the pantry.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' directly negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry.\n- Since the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry is negated, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 3 is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
