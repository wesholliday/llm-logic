Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' means that if the pen is not in the bag, then it must be on the desk.\n- 'The pen might not be on my desk' means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, then it cannot be the case that the pen must be on the desk. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' means that if the pen is not in the bag, then it must be on the desk.\n- 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk' means that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n- If it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk, then the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
