            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nThe statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This implies that it is not a necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" The second statement, \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" suggests that it is possible for the sunglasses not to be on her head, which means they are not necessarily on her head. Given the disjunction, if the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" directly negates the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head. Given the disjunction, if the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
