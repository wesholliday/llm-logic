This implies that it is not certain that the jacket is in the closet.\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that it is not necessary for the jacket to be in the closet.\n- Since the possibility that the jacket is not in the closet implies that it is not necessary for it to be there, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities: the jacket is either on the chair or it is necessarily in the closet.\n- The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that it is possible that the jacket is not in the closet, which means it is not necessarily in the closet.\n- Given that the jacket is not necessarily in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n- Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n- The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents two possibilities: the jacket is either on the chair or it is necessarily in the closet.\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that it is not necessary for the jacket to be in the closet.\n- Since it is not necessary for the jacket to be in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n- Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
