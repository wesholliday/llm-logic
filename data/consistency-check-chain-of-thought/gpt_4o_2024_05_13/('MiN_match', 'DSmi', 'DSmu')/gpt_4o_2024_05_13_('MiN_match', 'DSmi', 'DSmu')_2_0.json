            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1: From 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'?**\n\n- The statement 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet' suggests that it is possible that the keys are not in the cabinet. This implies that it is not a certainty that the keys are in the cabinet.\n- Therefore, 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' is a valid inference because the possibility of the keys not being there means it is not a necessity for them to be there.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet' suggests that it is possible the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that they are in the cabinet.\n- Since 'might not' does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer based on this information alone.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' means one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' negates the second condition, leaving only the first condition as the true one.\n- Therefore, we can infer that 'The keys are in the drawer' because the negation of the second condition in the disjunction leaves the first condition as the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
