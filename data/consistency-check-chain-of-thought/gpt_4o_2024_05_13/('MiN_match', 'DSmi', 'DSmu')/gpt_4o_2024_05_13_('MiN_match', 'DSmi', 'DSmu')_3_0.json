It only tells us that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, but it does not confirm the cat's location.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' together with 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom', can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?**\n\n- 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom' means that it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom.\n- If it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom, then the condition 'it must be playing in the bedroom' is false.\n- Given that one of the two conditions must be true and the second condition is false, we can infer that the first condition 'the cat is napping on the couch' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
