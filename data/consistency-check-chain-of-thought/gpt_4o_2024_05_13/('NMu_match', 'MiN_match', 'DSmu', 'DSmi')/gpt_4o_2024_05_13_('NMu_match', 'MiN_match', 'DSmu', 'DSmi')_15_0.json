This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk, then it cannot be the case that the pen must be on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" means that the second condition is false.\n- If the second condition is false, then the first condition must be true.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, but it does not confirm that the pen is not on the desk.\n- Since \"The pen might not be on my desk\" does not definitively rule out the possibility that the pen is on the desk, we cannot definitively infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n- Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
