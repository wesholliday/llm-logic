Therefore, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?**\n\n- \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is possible for the milk to not be in the fridge.\n- \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge.\n- If it is possible for the milk to not be in the fridge, then it cannot be necessary for it to be in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n- \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements is true.\n- \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the second part of the disjunction.\n- If the second part of the disjunction is false, then the first part must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n- \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements is true.\n- \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" means it is possible for the milk to not be in the fridge, but it does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge.\n- Since \"might not\" does not provide a definitive negation, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk is on the counter based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
