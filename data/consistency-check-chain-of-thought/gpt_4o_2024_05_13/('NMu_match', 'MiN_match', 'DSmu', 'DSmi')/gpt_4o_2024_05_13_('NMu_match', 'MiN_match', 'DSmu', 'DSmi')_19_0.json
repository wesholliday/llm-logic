            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1: From 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head'?**\n\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head' means that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head. This implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'?**\n\n- The statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This implies that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head. Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. The statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head' negates the second condition. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that 'The sunglasses are in her bag'. So, we can infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' together with 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head', can we infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' is a disjunction. The statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' indicates that it is possible for the sunglasses not to be on her head, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that they are on her head. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'The sunglasses are in her bag' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
