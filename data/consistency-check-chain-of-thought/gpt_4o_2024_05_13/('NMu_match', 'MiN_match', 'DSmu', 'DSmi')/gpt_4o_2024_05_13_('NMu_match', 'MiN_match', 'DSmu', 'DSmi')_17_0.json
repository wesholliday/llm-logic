This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n- Therefore, we can infer that 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'?**\n\n- The statement 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n- If there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it cannot be the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' negates the second condition.\n- If the second condition is negated, the first condition must be true.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means that it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not definitively negate the second condition.\n- Since the second condition is not definitively negated, we cannot conclusively infer that the first condition (the notebook is in the drawer) must be true.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
