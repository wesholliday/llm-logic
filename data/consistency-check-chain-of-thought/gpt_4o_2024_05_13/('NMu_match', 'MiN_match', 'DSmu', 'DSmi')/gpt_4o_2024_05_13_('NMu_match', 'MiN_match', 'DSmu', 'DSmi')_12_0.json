This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'?**\n\n- The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' means that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- If there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it cannot be the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' negates the second condition.\n- If the second condition is negated, the first condition must be true.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' means that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not definitively negate the second condition.\n- Since the second condition is not definitively negated, we cannot conclusively infer that the first condition (the toy is in the toy box) must be true.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
