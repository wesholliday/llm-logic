Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n### Question 3:\nStatements:\n1. \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\"\n2. \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door.\"\n\nInference: \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction: either A (shoes are in the closet) or B (shoes must be lined up by the door).\n- The second statement, \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door,\" suggests that it is possible that the shoes are not lined up by the door, but it does not definitively negate B.\n\nSince \"might not\" does not definitively negate B, we cannot conclusively infer that A (the shoes are in the closet) must be true.\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
