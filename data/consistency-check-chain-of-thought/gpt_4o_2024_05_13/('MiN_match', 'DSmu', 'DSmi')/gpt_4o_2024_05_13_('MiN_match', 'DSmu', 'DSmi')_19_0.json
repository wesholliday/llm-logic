Therefore, if it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n**Answer to Question 2: Yes**\n\n### Question 3:\nStatements:\n1. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n2. \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nInference: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction: Either A (sunglasses are in her bag) or B (they must be perched on her head).\n- The second statement says \"might not be,\" which means it is possible that they are not on her head, but it does not definitively negate B.\n\nSince \"might not be\" does not definitively negate B, we cannot conclusively infer that A (the sunglasses are in her bag) must be true. It only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\n**Answer to Question 3: No**\n\n**Answer: Yes, Yes, No**",
