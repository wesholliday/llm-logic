Therefore, if the umbrella does not have to be in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\n**Answer to Question 2: Yes**\n\n### Question 3:\nStatements:\n1. \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nInference: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either A or B\" where A is \"the umbrella is in the car\" and B is \"it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- The second statement says \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet,\" which means it is possible that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\nThe second statement does not definitively negate B; it only suggests a possibility. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to conclude that A (the umbrella is in the car) must be true.\n\n**Answer to Question 3: No**\n\n**Answer: Yes, Yes, No**",
