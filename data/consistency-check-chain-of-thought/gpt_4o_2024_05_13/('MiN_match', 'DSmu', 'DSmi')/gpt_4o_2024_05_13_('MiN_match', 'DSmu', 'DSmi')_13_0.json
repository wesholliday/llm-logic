            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?**\n\n- \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This implies that it is not certain that the milk is in the fridge.\n- \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge.\n- Since \"might not be\" indicates a lack of necessity, we can infer that it is not required for the milk to be in the fridge.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 1: Yes**\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n- \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements is true.\n- \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the second part of the disjunction.\n- If the second part of the disjunction is false, the first part (\"the milk is on the counter\") must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 2: Yes**\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?**\n\n- \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a disjunction.\n- \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that it is possible the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge.\n- Since \"might not be\" does not provide a definitive negation, it does not force the disjunction to resolve to \"the milk is on the counter.\"\n\n**Conclusion for Question 3: No**\n\n**Answer: Yes, Yes, No**",
