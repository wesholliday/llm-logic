            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n- If it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be necessary for Fido to be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' means that at least one of these statements is true.\n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n- If Fido is not necessarily in the garden, then the second part of the disjunction ('Fido must be in the garden') is false.\n- Since the second part is false, the first part ('Fido is inside') must be true for the disjunction to hold. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' means that at least one of these statements is true.\n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not provide certainty about Fido's location.\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not directly negate 'Fido must be in the garden' in a way that allows us to conclude definitively that 'Fido is inside'.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
