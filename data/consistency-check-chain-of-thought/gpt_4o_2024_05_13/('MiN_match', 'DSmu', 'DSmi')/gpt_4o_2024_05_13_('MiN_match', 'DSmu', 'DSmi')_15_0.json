Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n- 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk' means that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n- If it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk, then the pen does not have to be on the desk. Given the first statement, if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag. Therefore, we can infer that 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n- 'The pen might not be on my desk' means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n- The possibility that the pen is not on the desk does not necessarily mean that the pen is in the bag. It only means that there is a chance the pen is not on the desk. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
