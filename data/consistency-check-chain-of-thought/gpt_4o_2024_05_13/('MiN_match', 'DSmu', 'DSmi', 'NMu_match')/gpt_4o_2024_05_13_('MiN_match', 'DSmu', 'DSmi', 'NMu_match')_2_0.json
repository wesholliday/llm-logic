            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\nFrom 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'?\n\n- 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet' suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet.\n- 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' means that it is not necessary for the keys to be in the cabinet.\n- If the keys might not be in the cabinet, it implies that it is not a necessity for them to be there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**.\n\n**Question 2:**\nFrom 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?\n\n- 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements is true.\n- 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' negates the second part of the disjunction.\n- If the second part is false, the first part must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**.\n\n**Question 3:**\nFrom 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?\n\n- 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' is a disjunction.\n- 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet' suggests a possibility but does not definitively negate the second part of the disjunction.\n- Since 'might not' does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **no**.\n\n**Question 4:**\nFrom 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet'?\n\n- 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' means it is not necessary for the keys to be in the cabinet.\n- 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet' suggests a possibility that aligns with the lack of necessity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
