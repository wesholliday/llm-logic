            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Reasoning: If something might not be true, it means it is not necessarily true. Therefore, if the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, it is not the case that it must be hiding under the couch.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n- Reasoning: The first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement negates B (it must be hiding under the couch). If B is false, then A (the remote control is on the coffee table) must be true.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n- Reasoning: The first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement indicates that B (it must be hiding under the couch) is not necessarily true, but it does not definitively negate B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A (the remote control is on the coffee table) is true.\n- Conclusion: No, we cannot infer this.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Reasoning: If it is not necessarily true that the remote control is hiding under the couch, then it is possible (might be the case) that it is not hiding under the couch.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
