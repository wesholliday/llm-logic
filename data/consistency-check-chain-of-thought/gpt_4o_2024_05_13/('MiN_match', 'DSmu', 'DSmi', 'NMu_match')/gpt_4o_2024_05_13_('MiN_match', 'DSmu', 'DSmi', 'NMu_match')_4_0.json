            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- Reasoning: If the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, it implies that there is a possibility they are not there. Therefore, it is not necessary (must) for them to be in the pantry.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statements: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n- Reasoning: The first statement is a disjunction (either/or). The second statement negates one of the disjuncts (they must be hidden in the pantry). If one part of the disjunction is false, the other part must be true.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statements: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n- Reasoning: The first statement is a disjunction (either/or). The second statement indicates a possibility but does not definitively negate the second disjunct. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that the cookies are in the jar.\n- Conclusion: No, we cannot infer that.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n- Reasoning: If it is not necessary for the cookies to be in the pantry, it implies that there is a possibility they are not there.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
