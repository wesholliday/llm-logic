Therefore, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\n- \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements is true.\n- \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" negates the second part of the disjunction.\n- If the second part of the disjunction is false, the first part must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' together with 'The missing sock might not be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'?**\n\n- \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" is a disjunction.\n- \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" means it is possible that the sock is not under the bed, but it does not definitively negate the second part of the disjunction.\n- Since \"might not\" does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 4: From 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', can we infer 'The missing sock might not be under the bed'?**\n\n- \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" means it is not necessarily true that the sock is under the bed.\n- If it is not necessarily true that the sock is under the bed, then it is possible that the sock is not under the bed. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
