This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' means that if the notebook is not in the drawer, then it must be on the nightstand.\n- The statement 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means that it is possible for the notebook to not be on the nightstand.\n- If it is possible for the notebook to not be on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer to satisfy the first statement.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' together with 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' means that if the notebook is not in the drawer, then it must be on the nightstand.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' means that it is not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand.\n- If it is not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer to satisfy the first statement.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand', can we infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'?**\n\n- The statement 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means that it is possible for the notebook to not be on the nightstand.\n- If it is possible for the notebook to not be on the nightstand, then it is not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
