This implies that there is a possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' means that one of these two conditions must be true. The statement 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet' suggests that it is possible for the umbrella to be somewhere other than the closet, but it does not confirm that it is not in the closet. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'The umbrella is in the car'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' means one of these two conditions must be true. The statement 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet' negates the second condition, leaving only the first condition as true. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 4: From 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'?**\n\n- The statement 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet' suggests a possibility but does not provide certainty. However, if there is a possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet, it implies that it is not necessarily required to be in the closet. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
