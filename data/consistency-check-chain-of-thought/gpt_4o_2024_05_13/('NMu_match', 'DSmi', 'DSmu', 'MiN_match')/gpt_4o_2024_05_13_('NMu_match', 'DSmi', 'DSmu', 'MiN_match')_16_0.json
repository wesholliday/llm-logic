This implies that there is a possibility that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n- Therefore, we can infer that 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' presents two possibilities: the scarf is either in the backpack or it must be on the coat rack.\n- The statement 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack' suggests that it is possible for the scarf not to be on the coat rack, but it does not confirm that it is not on the coat rack.\n- Since 'might not' does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' together with 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack' presents two possibilities.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack' negates the necessity of the scarf being on the coat rack.\n- Given that the second statement negates one of the possibilities, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', can we infer 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'?**\n\n- The statement 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack' indicates a possibility but does not provide certainty.\n- However, if there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack, it implies that it is not a necessity for the scarf to be on the coat rack.\n- Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
