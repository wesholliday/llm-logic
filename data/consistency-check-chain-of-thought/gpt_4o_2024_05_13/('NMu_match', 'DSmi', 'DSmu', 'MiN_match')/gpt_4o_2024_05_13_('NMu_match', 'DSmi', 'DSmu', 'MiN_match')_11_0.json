This implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' presents two possibilities: the jacket is either on the chair or it must be in the closet.\n- The statement 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet' suggests that it is possible the jacket is not in the closet.\n- Given these two statements, if the jacket is not necessarily in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that it is draped over the chair.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' together with 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' again presents two possibilities.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet' means that it is not necessarily true that the jacket is in the closet.\n- Given these two statements, if the jacket is not necessarily in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that it is draped over the chair.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'?**\n\n- The statement 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet' means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet' means that it is not necessarily true that the jacket is in the closet.\n- Since both statements essentially convey the same idea that the jacket is not necessarily in the closet, we can infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
