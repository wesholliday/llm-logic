This implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?**\n\n- \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that it is possible for the keys not to be dangling in the cabinet, but it does not definitively state that they are not.\n- Since \"might not\" does not provide a definitive answer, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' together with 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'The keys are in the drawer'?**\n\n- \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" means one of these two conditions must be true.\n- \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" negates the second condition.\n- Therefore, if the second condition is false, the first condition must be true.\n- We can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet', can we infer 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'?**\n\n- \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests a possibility but does not definitively state that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n- \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is a stronger statement, indicating that it is not necessary for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet.\n- Since \"might not\" only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot infer the stronger statement from it.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
