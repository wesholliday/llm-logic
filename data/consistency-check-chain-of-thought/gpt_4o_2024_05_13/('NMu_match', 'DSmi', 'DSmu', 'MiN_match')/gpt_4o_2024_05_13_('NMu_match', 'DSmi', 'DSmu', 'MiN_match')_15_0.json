This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, but it does not confirm it.\n- Since \"might not be\" does not provide certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in the bag based on the given information.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n- \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" means that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n- Given that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the bag.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, then it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
