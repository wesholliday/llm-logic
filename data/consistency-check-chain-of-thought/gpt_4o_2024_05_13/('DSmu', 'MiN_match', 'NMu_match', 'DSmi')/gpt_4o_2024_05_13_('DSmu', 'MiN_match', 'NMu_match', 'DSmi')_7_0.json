The remote control is on the coffee table.\n2. The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with the first possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf something might not be true, it means that it is not necessarily true. Therefore, if the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, it is not the case that it must be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then it is possible that it is not hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table.\n2. The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is possible that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that it is hiding under the couch. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these statements alone.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
