Premise 2 negates the possibility that the watch must be on his wrist. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser. \n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Premise: The watch might not be on his wrist.\n- We need to infer: It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nIf the watch might not be on his wrist, it means there is a possibility that it is not on his wrist. This implies that it is not necessarily the case that the watch must be on his wrist. \n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Premise: It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n- We need to infer: The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nIf it is not the case that the watch must be on his wrist, it means that it is not a necessity for the watch to be on his wrist. This implies that there is a possibility that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Premise 1: Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n- Premise 2: The watch might not be on his wrist.\n- We need to infer: The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Premise 2 states that the watch might not be on his wrist, which means it is possible that it is not on his wrist. However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the watch is on his wrist. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based on these premises alone.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
