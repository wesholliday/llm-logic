            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not true that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf the book might not be resting on the table, it means there is a possibility that it is not on the table. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the book must be on the table. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table, it means that the book is not necessarily on the table. This implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 indicates that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not negate the possibility that the book must be on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
