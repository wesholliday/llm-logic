Therefore, the answer to Question 3 is **yes**.\n\n### Question 4:\n**Statement 1:** \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\nThis is \\( A \\lor B \\).\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\nThis is \\( \\neg B \\) in modal terms.\n\nFrom \\( A \\lor B \\) and \"might not be \\( B \\),\" we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\). Therefore, the answer to Question 4 is **no**.\n\n### Summary:\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
