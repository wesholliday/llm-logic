            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- Premise 2: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Premise 2 negates one of these possibilities (Fido must be in the garden). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Premise: Fido might not be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nIf Fido might not be in the garden, it means there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Premise: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nIf it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, it means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. This implies that there is a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- Premise 2: Fido might not be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Premise 2 states that Fido might not be in the garden, which means it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily confirm that Fido is inside, as it only indicates a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
