            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: \n1. The toy is in the toy box.\n2. The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with the first possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, it means there is a possibility that it is not on the bookshelf. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, it means that it is not a necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The toy is in the toy box.\n2. The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStatement 2 indicates that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which means it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf. This weakens the second possibility, but it does not definitively confirm the first possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
