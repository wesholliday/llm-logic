            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the book is on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based on these statements.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table (not B). If B is false, then A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the book to be on the table, it implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, it means that it is not a necessity for the book to be on the table. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
