            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either A (keys are in the drawer) or B (keys must be dangling in the cabinet). The second statement suggests that B is not necessarily true (the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet). However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A is true based on these statements.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either A (keys are in the drawer) or B (keys must be dangling in the cabinet). The second statement negates B (it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet). If B is false, then A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not necessary for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet. This implies that there is a possibility that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThe statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This implies that it is not a necessity for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
