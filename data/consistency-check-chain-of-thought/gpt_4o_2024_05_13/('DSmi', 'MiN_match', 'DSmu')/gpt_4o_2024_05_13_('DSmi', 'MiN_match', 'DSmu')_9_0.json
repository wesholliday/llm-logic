            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the sock being under the bed but does not definitively rule it out. Since \"might not\" does not equate to \"is not,\" we cannot definitively conclude that the sock is in the laundry basket based on these statements alone.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n\nThis statement implies that it is possible the sock is not under the bed. Therefore, it is not certain that the sock must be under the bed. This directly supports the inference that \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction. The second statement negates one of the disjuncts (\"it must be under the bed\"). If one part of a disjunction is false, the other part must be true. Therefore, if it is not the case that the sock must be under the bed, the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
