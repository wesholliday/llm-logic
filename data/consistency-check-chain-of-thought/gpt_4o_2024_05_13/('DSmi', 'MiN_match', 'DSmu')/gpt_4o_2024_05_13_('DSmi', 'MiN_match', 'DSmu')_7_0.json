Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement introduces a possibility but does not definitively rule out the remote being under the couch. Since \"might not\" does not provide a definitive negation, we cannot conclusively infer that the remote is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement implies that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the remote control must be under the couch. This means we can infer that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement negates the necessity of B (it is not the case that the remote must be hiding under the couch). Given that one part of the disjunction (B) is negated, we can infer that the other part (A) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
