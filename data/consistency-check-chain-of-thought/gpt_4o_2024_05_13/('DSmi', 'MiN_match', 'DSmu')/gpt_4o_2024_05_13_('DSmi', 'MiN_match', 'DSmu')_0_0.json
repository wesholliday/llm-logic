            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is 'Fido is inside' and \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden.\n3. Since 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not provide a definitive negation of \\( B \\), we cannot conclusively infer \\( A \\) (i.e., 'Fido is inside').\n\n**Question 2: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n2. If there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n3. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n1. The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\), where \\( A \\) is 'Fido is inside' and \\( B \\) is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n2. The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n3. Given \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), by the rule of disjunction elimination, we can infer \\( A \\).\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
