            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table but does not definitively state that the book is not on the table. Since \"might not\" implies that it is possible the book is not on the table, it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThis statement implies that it is possible the book is not on the table. If something \"might not\" be the case, it means it is not necessarily true. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement negates the second condition of the disjunction. If \"it must be resting on the table\" is false, then the only remaining option in the disjunction is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
