            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n  - This is a disjunction (A or B).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist, but it does not definitively state that it is not on his wrist.\n\nTo infer \"The watch is charging on the dresser,\" we need to be certain that the watch is not on his wrist. However, \"might not be\" does not provide that certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement:** \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist,\" we need to understand that \"must be\" implies certainty. Since \"might not be\" indicates that there is a possibility the watch is not on his wrist, it directly supports the idea that it is not necessarily the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n  - This is a disjunction (A or B).\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n  - This negates the second part of the disjunction (not B).\n\nGiven the disjunction (A or B) and knowing that B is false (not B), we can infer that A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
