The possibility of \\( \\neg P \\) does not eliminate \\( P \\) as a valid option.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 1:** No, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This implies that it is possible that \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" (\\( \\neg P \\)), we need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) is a valid conclusion.\n\nSince \"might not\" implies the possibility of \\( \\neg P \\), it directly supports the statement that it is not necessarily the case that \\( P \\) is true.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 2:** Yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( C \\lor P \\).\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTo infer \"The cookies are in the jar\" (\\( C \\)), we need to determine if \\( C \\) must be true given \\( C \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nFrom \\( C \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can conclude \\( C \\) because \\( P \\) is false, leaving \\( C \\) as the only remaining option.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 3:** Yes, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n**Answer:** no, yes, yes",
