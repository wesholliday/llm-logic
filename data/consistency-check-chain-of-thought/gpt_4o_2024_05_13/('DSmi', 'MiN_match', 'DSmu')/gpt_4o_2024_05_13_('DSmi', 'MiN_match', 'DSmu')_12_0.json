            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The toy is in the toy box.\n2. The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStatement 2 suggests that the toy might not be on the bookshelf, which means it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the toy is in the toy box based on these statements alone.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nThis statement implies that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is not certain that the toy must be on the bookshelf. Hence, we can infer that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The toy is in the toy box.\n2. The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
