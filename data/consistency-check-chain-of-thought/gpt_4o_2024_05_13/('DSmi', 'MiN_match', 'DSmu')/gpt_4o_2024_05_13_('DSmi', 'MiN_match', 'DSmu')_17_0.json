Therefore, this inference is valid.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"The notebook is in the drawer\" and \\( B \\) is \"The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n- To infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n  - Given \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can conclude \\( A \\) because if \\( B \\) is false, \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
