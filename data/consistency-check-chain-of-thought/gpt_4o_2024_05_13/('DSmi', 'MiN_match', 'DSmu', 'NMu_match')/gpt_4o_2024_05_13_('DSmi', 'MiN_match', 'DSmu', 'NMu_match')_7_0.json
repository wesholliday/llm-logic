            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out that it is under the couch. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these statements.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch. This directly supports the inference that it is not necessarily the case that the remote control must be under the couch.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates B (it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch). Therefore, if B is false, A must be true. Hence, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily the case that the remote control must be under the couch, it implies that there is a possibility that it is not under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
