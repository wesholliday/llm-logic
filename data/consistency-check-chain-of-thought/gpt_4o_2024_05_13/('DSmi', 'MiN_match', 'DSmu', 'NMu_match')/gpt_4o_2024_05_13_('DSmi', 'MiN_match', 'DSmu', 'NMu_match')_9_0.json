            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either the sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. The second statement introduces a possibility but does not definitively rule out the sock being under the bed. Since \"might not\" does not provide certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\nIf the sock might not be under the bed, it implies that it is not necessarily under the bed. Therefore, it is not the case that the sock must be under the bed.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction. The second statement negates one of the disjuncts (the sock must be under the bed). By the rule of disjunction elimination, if one disjunct is false, the other must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the sock must be under the bed, it means there is a possibility that it is not under the bed. Therefore, the sock might not be under the bed.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
