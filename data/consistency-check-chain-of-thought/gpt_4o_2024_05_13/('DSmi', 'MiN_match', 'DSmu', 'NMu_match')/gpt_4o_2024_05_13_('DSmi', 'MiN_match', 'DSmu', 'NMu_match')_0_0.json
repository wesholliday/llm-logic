Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' can be written as \\( \\neg B \\).\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination to infer \\( A \\) (i.e., 'Fido is inside').\n\n**Question 4: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?**\n\n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden.\n- If it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden, then it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
