            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the book is on the shelf\" and B is \"the book must be resting on the table.\" Statement 2 suggests that B is not necessarily true, which means B is not definitively true. However, this does not confirm A (the book is on the shelf) because B being not necessarily true does not rule out the possibility that the book is not on the shelf either. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf the book might not be resting on the table, it implies that it is not necessarily true that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the book is on the shelf\" and B is \"the book must be resting on the table.\" Statement 2 negates B, which means B is false. In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true. Therefore, if B is false, A must be true. Hence, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table, it means that it is possible for the book to not be resting on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
