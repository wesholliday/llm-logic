            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and B is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" Statement 2 suggests that B is not necessarily true, but it does not definitively rule out B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A is true based on these statements alone.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf something might not be true, it means that it is not necessarily true. Therefore, if the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it is indeed not the case that they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B). Statement 2 negates B. If B is false, then A must be true in a disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, it implies that there is a possibility that they are not dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
