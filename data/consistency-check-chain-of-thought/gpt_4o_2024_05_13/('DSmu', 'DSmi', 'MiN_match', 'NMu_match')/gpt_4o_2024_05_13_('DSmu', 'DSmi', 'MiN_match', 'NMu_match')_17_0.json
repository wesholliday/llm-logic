Statement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be on the nightstand. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the notebook being on the nightstand, but it does not definitively rule it out. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it implies that it is not necessarily on the nightstand. Therefore, it is not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand, it means there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Therefore, the notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
