            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box, or it must be on the bookshelf. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the toy must be on the bookshelf). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nStatement 1 gives us two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box, or it must be on the bookshelf. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf (it might not be there). However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf the toy might not be on the bookshelf, it means there is a possibility that it is not there. This directly implies that it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer the given statement.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf, it means there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can infer the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
