            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. Statement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not necessary for the milk to be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the milk chilling in the fridge but does not negate it. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nIf the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, it implies that it is not necessarily the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the milk to be chilling in the fridge, it means there is a possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
