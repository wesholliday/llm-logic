            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- Premise 2: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside (A) or Fido must be in the garden (B). Premise 2 negates B (It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden). Therefore, if B is false, A must be true. Hence, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- Premise 2: Fido might not be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nPremise 1 gives us two possibilities: Fido is inside (A) or Fido must be in the garden (B). Premise 2 states that Fido might not be in the garden, which means it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively negate B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that Fido is inside based on this information.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Premise: Fido might not be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nIf Fido might not be in the garden, it means there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Premise: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- We need to determine if we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nIf it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, it means that it is not a necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This implies that there is a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
