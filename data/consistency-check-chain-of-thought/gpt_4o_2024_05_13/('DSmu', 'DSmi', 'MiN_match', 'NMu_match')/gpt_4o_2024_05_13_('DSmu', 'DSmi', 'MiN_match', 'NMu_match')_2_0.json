The keys are in the drawer.\n2. The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The keys are in the drawer.\n2. The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty about the keys dangling in the cabinet but does not definitively negate it. \"Might not\" means it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, but it does not rule out the possibility that they are. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThis statement introduces uncertainty about the keys dangling in the cabinet. It means it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. If it were a necessity, there would be no room for doubt.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThis statement means that it is not a necessity for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet. There is a possibility that they are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, as the necessity is negated.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
