            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag (A) or they must be perched on her head (B). Statement 2 negates the necessity of B, meaning B is false. If B is false, then A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag (A) or they must be perched on her head (B). Statement 2 says that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, which means B is not necessarily true, but it doesn't definitively make B false. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A is true based on this information alone.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, it means there is a possibility that they are not on her head. This implies that it is not a necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, it means there is no necessity for them to be on her head. This implies that there is a possibility that they are not on her head. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
