Given Statement 1, if the remote control is not necessarily under the couch, the only remaining option is that it is on the coffee table.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n### Question 2:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nStatement 2 indicates a possibility but not a certainty. It means the remote control could be under the couch or it might not be. This does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Inference:** No, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n### Question 3:\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch. This aligns with the idea that it is not necessarily under the couch.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\n### Question 4:\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement means that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that it might not be under the couch.\n\n**Inference:** Yes, we can infer that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
