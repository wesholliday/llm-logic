            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the book must be resting on the table). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nStatement 1 gives us two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the book resting on the table (it might not be resting on the table). This does not definitively rule out the possibility that the book must be resting on the table, so we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf the book might not be resting on the table, it implies that it is not necessarily true that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table, it means that there is a possibility that the book is not resting on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
