The umbrella is in the car.\n2. The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, leaving us with the first possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The umbrella is in the car.\n2. The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not negate it. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet, it means there is a possibility that it is not there. This implies that it is not necessarily the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. Therefore, we can infer this statement.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet, it means that it is not a necessity for the umbrella to be there. This implies that there is a possibility that the umbrella might not be there. Therefore, we can infer this statement.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
