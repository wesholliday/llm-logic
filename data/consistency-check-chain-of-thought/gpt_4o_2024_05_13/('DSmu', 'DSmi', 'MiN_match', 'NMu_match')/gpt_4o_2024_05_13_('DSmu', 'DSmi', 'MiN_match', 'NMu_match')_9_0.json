            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the sock must be under the bed). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nStatement 1 gives us two possibilities: the sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the sock being under the bed (it might not be under the bed), but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the sock must be under the bed. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\nIf the sock might not be under the bed, it means there is a possibility that it is not under the bed. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the sock must be under the bed. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the sock must be under the bed.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the sock must be under the bed, it means that the sock is not necessarily under the bed. This implies that there is a possibility that the sock might not be under the bed. Therefore, we can infer that the sock might not be under the bed.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
