Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the cat must be playing in the bedroom). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the cat is either napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the cat playing in the bedroom (it might not be playing there). However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n**Answer: No**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n\nIf the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, it means there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom, it means that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom. This implies that there is a possibility that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Final Answers:**\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
