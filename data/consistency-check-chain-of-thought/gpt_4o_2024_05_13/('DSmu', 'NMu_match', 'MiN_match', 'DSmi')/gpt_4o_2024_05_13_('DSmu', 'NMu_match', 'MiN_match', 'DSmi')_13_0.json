            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the milk must be chilling in the fridge). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nIf it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, it means that it is possible that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nIf the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, it means there is a possibility that it is not chilling in the fridge. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. Statement 2 indicates that it is possible that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
