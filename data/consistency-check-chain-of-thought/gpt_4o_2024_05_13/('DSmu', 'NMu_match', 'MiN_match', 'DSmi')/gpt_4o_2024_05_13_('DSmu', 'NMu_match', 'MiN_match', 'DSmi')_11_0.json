The jacket is draped over the chair.\n2. The jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from Statement 1 is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Answer to Question 1: Yes.**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the jacket to be hanging in the closet, then it is possible (i.e., it might be the case) that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n**Answer to Question 2: Yes.**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nIf it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it cannot be the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\n**Answer to Question 3: Yes.**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The jacket is draped over the chair.\n2. The jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is possible the jacket is not hanging in the closet, which means it is not necessarily hanging in the closet. This aligns with the first possibility from Statement 1, but it does not definitively confirm it. The jacket might be draped over the chair, but it is not a certainty based on the given information.\n\n**Answer to Question 4: No.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
