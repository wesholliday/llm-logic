            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have a logical disjunction: \\( A \\lor B \\) (where \\( A \\) is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and \\( B \\) is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\").\nFrom Statement 2, we have \\( \\neg B \\) (the negation of \\( B \\)).\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction elimination (if \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), then \\( A \\)), we can infer that \\( A \\) is true.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 1 is \"yes\".\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" (\\( \\neg \\text{must}(B) \\)) implies that it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This means that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, which aligns with the statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nSo, the answer to Question 2 is \"yes\".\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nIf the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, it means there is a possibility that they are not there. This directly implies that it is not necessarily the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 3 is \"yes\".\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (where \\( A \\) is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and \\( B \\) is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\").\nFrom Statement 2, \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that \\( \\neg \\text{must}(B) \\), but it does not provide a definitive \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nSince \"might not\" does not definitively negate \\( B \\), we cannot conclusively infer \\( A \\) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \"might not B\".\n\nSo, the answer to Question 4 is \"no\".\n\n**Answer:**\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
