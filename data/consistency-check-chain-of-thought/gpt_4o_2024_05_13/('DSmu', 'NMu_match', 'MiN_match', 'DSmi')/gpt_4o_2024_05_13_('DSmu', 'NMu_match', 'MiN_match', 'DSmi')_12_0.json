            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: \n1. The toy is in the toy box.\n2. The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf, then it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This means the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nIf the toy might not be on the bookshelf, it implies that it is not a certainty that the toy must be on the bookshelf. Therefore, it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The toy is in the toy box.\n2. The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStatement 2 indicates that it is possible the toy is not on the bookshelf, which means it is not necessarily on the bookshelf. This aligns with the first possibility from Statement 1, suggesting that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
