Statement 2 negates the second possibility (the book must be resting on the table). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. \n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf it is not necessary for the book to be resting on the table, then it is possible that the book is not resting on the table. This means there is a possibility that the book might not be on the table.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the book might not be resting on the table, then it cannot be the case that the book must be resting on the table. If it were a necessity, there would be no possibility of it not being on the table.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- We need to determine if we can infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table. Statement 2 indicates that it is possible for the book not to be on the table, which means it is not a necessity for the book to be on the table. This aligns with the first possibility in Statement 1, which is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
