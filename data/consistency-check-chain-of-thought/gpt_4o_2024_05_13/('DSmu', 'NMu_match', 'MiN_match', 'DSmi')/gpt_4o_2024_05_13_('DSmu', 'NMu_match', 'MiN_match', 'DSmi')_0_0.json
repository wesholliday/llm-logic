            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- Premise 2: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- We need to infer: Fido is inside.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Premise 2 negates one of these possibilities (Fido must be in the garden). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Premise: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- We need to infer: Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nIf it's not necessary for Fido to be in the garden, then it is possible that Fido might not be in the garden. This means there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Premise: Fido might not be in the garden.\n- We need to infer: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nIf there is a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- Premise 2: Fido might not be in the garden.\n- We need to infer: Fido is inside.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Premise 2 states that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside based on these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
