            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Additional Information: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement suggests that it is possible the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively rule out the book being on the table. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n- Conclusion: No, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- Additional Information: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: The first statement is a disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table (not B). If B is false, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: This statement indicates a possibility but does not provide certainty. It does not directly address the necessity of the book being on the table.\n- Conclusion: No, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" from \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n- Analysis: This statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table, which implies that there is a possibility the book is not on the table.\n- Conclusion: Yes, we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table\" from \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
