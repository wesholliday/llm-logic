            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B). Statement 2 introduces a possibility (not necessarily B). However, \"might not\" does not definitively rule out B. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that A (the remote control is on the coffee table) is true.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B). Statement 2 negates B (not necessarily B). If B is not necessarily true, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer that A (the remote control is on the coffee table).\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n\"Might not\" implies a possibility, which means it is not certain that the remote control is under the couch. This aligns with the statement that it is not necessarily the case that the remote control must be under the couch. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily the case that the remote control must be under the couch, it implies that there is a possibility that it might not be under the couch. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
