            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement introduces a possibility (might not be B), but it does not definitively rule out B. Since the second statement does not provide a definitive negation of B, we cannot conclusively infer A.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement negates B. If B is negated, then A must be true. Therefore, we can infer A.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nIf something might not be the case, it implies that it is not necessarily the case. Therefore, if the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, it is not necessarily true that it must be draped on the coat rack. Thus, we can infer the statement.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, it means that it is not a necessity. This implies that there is a possibility that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack. Therefore, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
