            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either the notebook is in the drawer (A) or it must be on the nightstand (B). The second statement suggests that it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which means B is not necessarily true. However, this does not definitively confirm that A is true. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either the notebook is in the drawer (A) or it must be on the nightstand (B). The second statement negates B, meaning it is not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand. If B is false, then A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it implies that it is not necessarily true that the notebook must be on the nightstand. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nIf it is not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand, it means that it is possible for the notebook to be elsewhere. Therefore, it is possible that the notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
