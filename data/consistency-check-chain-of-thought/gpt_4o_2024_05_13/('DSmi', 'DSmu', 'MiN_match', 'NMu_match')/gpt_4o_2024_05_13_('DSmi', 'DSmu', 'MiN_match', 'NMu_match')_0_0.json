            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- Statement 2: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n- We need to infer: \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement suggests that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that Fido is inside based on the given information.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- We need to infer: \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction. The second statement negates one of the disjuncts (\"Fido must be in the garden\"). If \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false, then the only remaining option from the disjunction is \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nIf it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- We need to infer: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden, it means there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
