Statement 2 suggests that B (blending in on the floor) is not necessarily true, but it doesn't definitively rule it out. Since \"might not\" does not provide a definitive negation, we cannot conclusively infer that the missing piece is in the box.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction (A or B). Statement 2 negates B (blending in on the floor). If B is negated, then A (the missing puzzle piece is in the box) must be true.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n\n\"Might not\" implies that it is possible that the piece is not blending in on the floor, which aligns with the idea that it is not necessarily the case that it must be blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the piece must be blending in on the floor, it implies that there is a possibility that it might not be blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can infer this.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
