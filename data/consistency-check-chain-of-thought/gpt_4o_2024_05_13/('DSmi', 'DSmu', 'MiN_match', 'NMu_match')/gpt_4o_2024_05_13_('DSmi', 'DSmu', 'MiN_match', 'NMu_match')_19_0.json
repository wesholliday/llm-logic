The second statement suggests that B (sunglasses perched on her head) is not necessarily true, but it doesn't definitively rule it out. Since \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (either A or B). The second statement negates B (sunglasses must be perched on her head). If B is negated, then A (sunglasses are in her bag) must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\n\"Might not\" implies a possibility, which means there is a chance that the sunglasses are not on her head. This aligns with the statement that it is not necessarily the case that the sunglasses must be on her head. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses must be on her head, it implies that there is a possibility they might not be on her head. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
