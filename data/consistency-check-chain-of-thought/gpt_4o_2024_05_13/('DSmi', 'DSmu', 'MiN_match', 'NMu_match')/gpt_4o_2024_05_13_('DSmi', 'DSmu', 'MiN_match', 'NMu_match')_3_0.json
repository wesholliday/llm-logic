The second statement introduces a possibility: the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, which means it is possible that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but it does not definitively rule out that the cat is playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction: either A (cat is napping on the couch) or B (cat must be playing in the bedroom). The second statement negates B: it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This negation of B leaves A as the only remaining possibility. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n\nThe statement \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\" means that it is possible that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\n**Question 4:**\n- Statement: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n- We need to infer: \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\"\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" means that it is not necessarily true that the cat is playing in the bedroom. This implies that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we can infer that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
