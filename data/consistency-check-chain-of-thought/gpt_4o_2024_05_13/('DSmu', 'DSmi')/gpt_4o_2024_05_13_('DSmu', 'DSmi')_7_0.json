Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas. The first answer is for the first question, the second answer is for the second question, etc. Each answer should be either 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and B is \"it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This is a negation of B (\u00acB).\n\nGiven these two statements:\n- The disjunction (A or B) means that at least one of A or B must be true.\n- The negation (\u00acB) means B is false.\n\nIf B is false, then for the disjunction (A or B) to hold true, A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This is the same disjunction (A or B) as in Question 1.\n2. **Statement 2**: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This suggests that it is possible that B is false, but it does not definitively state that B is false.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n- The disjunction (A or B) means that at least one of A or B must be true.\n- The possibility that B might be false (but not definitively false) does not provide enough information to conclude that A must be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- For Question 1, the answer is \"yes.\"\n- For Question 2, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
