It only indicates that \\( B \\) is not necessarily true, but it does not confirm \\( \\neg B \\).\n- Since \\( \\neg \\text{necessarily } B \\) does not definitively rule out \\( B \\), we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based on the given information.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- For Question 1, the answer is \"yes\".\n- For Question 2, the answer is \"no\".\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
