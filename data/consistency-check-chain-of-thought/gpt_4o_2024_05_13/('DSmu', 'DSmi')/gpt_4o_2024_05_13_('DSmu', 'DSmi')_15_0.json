Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas. The first answer is for the first question, the second answer is for the second question, etc. Each answer should be either 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

It only suggests that \\( Q \\) is not necessarily true.\n- Since \\( Q \\) might still be true, we cannot definitively conclude \\( P \\) based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
