            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( A \\vee B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"the milk is on the counter\" and \\( B \\) is \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (\"The milk is on the counter\").\n\n- From \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination (if one part of an \"or\" statement is false, the other must be true).\n- Since \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( A \\vee B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"the milk is on the counter\" and \\( B \\) is \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, but not certain.\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (\"The milk is on the counter\").\n\n- The phrase \"might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that \\( B \\) is not necessarily true, but it does not definitively state that \\( B \\) is false.\n- Since \\( \\neg B \\) is only a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\) based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the reasoning above, the answers to the questions are:\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
