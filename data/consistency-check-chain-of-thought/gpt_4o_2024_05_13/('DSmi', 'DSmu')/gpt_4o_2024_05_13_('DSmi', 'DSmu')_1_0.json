Therefore, we cannot infer \"The book is on the shelf\" with certainty.\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the book is on the shelf\" and B is \"the book must be resting on the table.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This negates B, meaning \"the book must be resting on the table\" is false.\n\nGiven these two statements, if B is false, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
