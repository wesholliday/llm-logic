Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas. The first answer is for the first question, the second answer is for the second question, etc. Each answer should be either 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and B is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not definitively state that they are not in the cabinet.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer because the second statement only introduces a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" with certainty.\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and B is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This negates the second part of the disjunction (not B).\n\nGiven these two statements, if B is false (the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet), then the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is A (the keys are in the drawer). Therefore, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
