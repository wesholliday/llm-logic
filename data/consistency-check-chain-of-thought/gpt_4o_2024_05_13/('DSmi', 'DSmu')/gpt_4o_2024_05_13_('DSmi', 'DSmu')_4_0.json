Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas. The first answer is for the first question, the second answer is for the second question, etc. Each answer should be either 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

Therefore, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( C \\lor P \\).\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nGiven these two statements, if \\( \\neg P \\) is true, then \\( P \\) is false. Since \\( C \\lor P \\) must be true and \\( P \\) is false, \\( C \\) must be true. Therefore, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
