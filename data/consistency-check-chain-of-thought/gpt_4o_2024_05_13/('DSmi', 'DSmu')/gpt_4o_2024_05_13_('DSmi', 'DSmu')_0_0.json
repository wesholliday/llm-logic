The first statement provides two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden. The second statement introduces uncertainty about Fido being in the garden but does not eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based on these statements.\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\text{Fido is inside} \\vee \\text{Fido must be in the garden} \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg (\\text{Fido must be in the garden}) \\).\n\nTo infer \"Fido is inside,\" we need to determine if the given statements logically lead to that conclusion. The first statement provides two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden. The second statement negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that Fido is inside.\n\nThus, we can infer that Fido is inside based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
