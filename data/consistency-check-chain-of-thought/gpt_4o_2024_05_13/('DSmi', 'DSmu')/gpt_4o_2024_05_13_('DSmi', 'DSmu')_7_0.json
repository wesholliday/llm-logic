Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (A or B), where A is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and B is \"the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This suggests that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out that it is under the couch.\n\nTo infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, we need to definitively rule out that it is under the couch. However, the second statement only indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n### Question 2:\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This is the same disjunction (A or B) as in Question 1.\n2. **Statement 2**: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch, effectively ruling out B.\n\nIf B is ruled out, then A must be true because in a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
