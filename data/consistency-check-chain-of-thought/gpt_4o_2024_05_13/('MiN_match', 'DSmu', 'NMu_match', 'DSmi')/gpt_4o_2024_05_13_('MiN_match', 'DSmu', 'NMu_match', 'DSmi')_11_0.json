Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n- This inference is valid.\n\n### Question 2:\nStatements: \n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nInference: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction: either A (jacket is draped over the chair) or B (jacket must be hanging in the closet).\n- The second statement negates B (jacket must be hanging in the closet).\n- If B is false, then A must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n- This inference is valid.\n\n### Question 3:\nStatement: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\nInference: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\n- If it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, it means there is no necessity for it to be there.\n- This implies that there is a possibility (might) that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n- This inference is valid.\n\n### Question 4:\nStatements:\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n2. \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nInference: \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\n- The first statement is a disjunction: either A (jacket is draped over the chair) or B (jacket must be hanging in the closet).\n- The second statement indicates a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not negate B (jacket must be hanging in the closet).\n- Since the second statement does not provide a definitive negation of B, we cannot conclusively infer A.\n- This inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
