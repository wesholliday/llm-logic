This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'?**\n\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk, then it cannot be the case that the pen must be on the desk.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'The pen might not be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n- \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n- If it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag to satisfy the first statement.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' together with 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?**\n\n- \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n- \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" means that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n- If it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk, then the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in my bag.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, yes",
