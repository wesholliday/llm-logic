This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\n**Question 2: From 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'?**\n\n- The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' means that it is possible for the toy to be somewhere else, which implies that it is not a necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be on the bookshelf.\n- The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' means that it is possible for the toy to be somewhere other than the bookshelf, which does not necessarily mean it is in the toy box.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively infer 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' together with 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf', can we infer 'The toy is in the toy box'?**\n\n- The statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be on the bookshelf.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf, which implies that the toy could be in the toy box or somewhere else.\n- Given the disjunction and the negation of the necessity, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box if it is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
