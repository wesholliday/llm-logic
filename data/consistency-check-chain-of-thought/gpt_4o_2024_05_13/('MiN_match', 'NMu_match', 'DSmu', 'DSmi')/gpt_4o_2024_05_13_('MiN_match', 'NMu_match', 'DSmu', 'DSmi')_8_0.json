Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n\n**Question 2: From 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor'?**\n\n- \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" means that it is not necessarily true that the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\n- \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" means that it is possible that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n- If it is not necessarily true that the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, then it is possible that it is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n\n**Question 3: From 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?**\n\n- \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" means that the second condition is not true.\n- If the second condition is not true, then the first condition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\n**Question 4: From 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?**\n\n- \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\" means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n- \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" means that it is possible that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is blending in on the floor.\n- Since \"might not\" does not definitively rule out the second condition, we cannot definitively infer that the first condition (the missing puzzle piece is in the box) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
