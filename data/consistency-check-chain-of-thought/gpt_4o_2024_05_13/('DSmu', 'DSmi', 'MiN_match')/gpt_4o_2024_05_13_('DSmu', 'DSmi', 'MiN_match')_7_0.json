            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch. Given the disjunction in Statement 1, if one part of the disjunction is false (the remote control must be hiding under the couch), then the other part (the remote control is on the coffee table) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n- Statement 2: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nStatement 2 indicates a possibility but not a certainty. It means that it is possible that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, but it does not rule out the possibility that it might be hiding under the couch. Therefore, this does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nThus, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This implies that it is not necessarily true that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
