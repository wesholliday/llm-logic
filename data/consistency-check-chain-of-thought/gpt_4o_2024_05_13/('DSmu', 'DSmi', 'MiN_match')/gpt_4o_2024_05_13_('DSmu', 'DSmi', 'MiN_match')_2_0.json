            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n  - This is a disjunction (A or B), where A = \"the keys are in the drawer\" and B = \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n  - This is the negation of B, i.e., \u00acB.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n- From the disjunction (A or B) and the negation of B (\u00acB), we can infer A (the keys are in the drawer) because if B is false, A must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 1 is **yes**.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n  - This is the same disjunction (A or B).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, but it does not definitively state that they are not. It introduces uncertainty about B but does not negate B.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n- The possibility that B might not be true does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that A is true. The disjunction (A or B) still holds if B is possibly true.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 2 is **no**.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement:** \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, but it does not definitively state that they are not.\n- We need to infer: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n  - This is the negation of the necessity of B (\u00acB).\n\nGiven the statement:\n- If it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then it cannot be the case that they must be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, the possibility of not being in the cabinet implies that it is not a necessity.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 3 is **yes**.\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
