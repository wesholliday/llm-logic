This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and the possibility of \\( \\neg B \\), we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\) because \\( B \\) might still be true. The possibility of \\( \\neg B \\) does not provide enough information to conclude \\( A \\).\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n  - This means it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf. In other words, if it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it cannot be the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
