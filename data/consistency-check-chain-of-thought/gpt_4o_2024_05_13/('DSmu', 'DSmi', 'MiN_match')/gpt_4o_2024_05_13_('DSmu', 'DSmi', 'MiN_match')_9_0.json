            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"the missing sock is in the laundry basket\" and \\( B \\) is \"the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination:\n- If \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box B \\) (where \\( \\Box B \\) means \"it must be the case that B\").\n\nThe statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" (\\( \\neg \\Box B \\)) does not provide definitive information about whether \\( B \\) is true or false. It only indicates that \\( B \\) is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer \\( A \\) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg \\Box B \\).\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement:** \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box B \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\neg \\Box B \\), we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that \\( B \\) is true. This directly translates to \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" (\\( \\neg B \\)).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
