Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Premise 1:** Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nPremise 2 negates one of these possibilities: Fido must be in the garden is false.\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nSo, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Premise 1:** Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n- **Premise 2:** Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nPremise 1 gives us two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nPremise 2 states that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not definitively rule out that Fido must be in the garden.\nSince 'might not' does not provide a definitive negation, we cannot conclusively infer that Fido is inside.\n\nSo, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Premise:** Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nThis means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. If it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden (because 'must' implies certainty, and 'might not' implies uncertainty).\n\nSo, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
