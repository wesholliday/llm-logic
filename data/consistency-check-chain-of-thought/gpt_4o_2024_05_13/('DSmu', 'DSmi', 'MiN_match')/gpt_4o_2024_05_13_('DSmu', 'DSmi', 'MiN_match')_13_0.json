            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"the milk is on the counter\" and \\( B \\) is \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n- **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination:\n- If \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement 1:** \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- **Statement 2:** \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, but it does not definitively state \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and the possibility of \\( \\neg B \\), we cannot definitively conclude \\( A \\) because \\( B \\) might still be true. The possibility of \\( \\neg B \\) does not provide enough information to conclude \\( A \\).\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement:** \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nFrom the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we can infer that it is not necessarily true that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
