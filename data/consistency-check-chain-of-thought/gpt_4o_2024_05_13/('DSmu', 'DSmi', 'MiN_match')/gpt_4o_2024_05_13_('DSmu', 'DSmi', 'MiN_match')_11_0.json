It only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n- Since \\( \\neg B \\) is not definitively true, we cannot conclusively infer \\( A \\) from \\( A \\lor B \\).\n\nSo, the answer to Question 2 is **no**.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement:** \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\text{ might be true} \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" (\\( \\neg B \\)).\n\n- The phrase \"might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that it is possible that \\( \\neg B \\) is true, but it does not definitively state \\( \\neg B \\).\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively infer \\( \\neg B \\) from the possibility that \\( \\neg B \\) might be true.\n\nSo, the answer to Question 3 is **no**.\n\n### Final Answers:\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
