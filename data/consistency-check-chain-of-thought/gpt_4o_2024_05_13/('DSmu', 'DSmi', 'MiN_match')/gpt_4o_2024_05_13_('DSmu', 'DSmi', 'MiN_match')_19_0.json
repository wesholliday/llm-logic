            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Question 1:\n- **Statement 1:** Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n- **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The sunglasses are in her bag.\n2. The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second possibility, meaning it is not true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 1:** Yes, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n### Question 2:\n- **Statement 1:** Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n- **Statement 2:** The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n1. The sunglasses are in her bag.\n2. The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty about the second possibility, saying that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This does not definitively negate the second possibility; it only introduces doubt. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based on this information alone.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 2:** No, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n### Question 3:\n- **Statement:** The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nThis statement introduces the possibility that the sunglasses are not perched on her head. If something might not be true, it means it is not necessarily true. Therefore, it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n**Conclusion for Question 3:** Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n**Answer:** yes, no, yes",
