            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\) where \\( A \\) is \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\" and \\( B \\) is \"the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\) by the rule of disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is \"yes.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- Statement 2: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box B \\) (where \\( \\Box B \\) means \"it must be the case that B\").\n\nThe statement \\( \\neg \\Box B \\) means that it is not necessarily true that the piece must be blending in on the floor, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that \\( B \\) is false. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( A \\) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg \\Box B \\). The answer to Question 2 is \"no.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box B \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\neg \\Box B \\), we can infer that it is not necessarily true that \\( B \\) must be the case. This directly translates to \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\" Therefore, the answer to Question 3 is \"yes.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
