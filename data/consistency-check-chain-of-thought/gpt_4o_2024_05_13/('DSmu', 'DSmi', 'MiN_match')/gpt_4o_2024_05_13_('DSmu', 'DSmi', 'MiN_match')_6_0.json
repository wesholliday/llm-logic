The possibility of \\( \\neg C \\) does not provide enough information to make a definite inference.\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\"\n  - This means it is possible that \\( \\neg C \\) is true.\n\nFrom the statement \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet,\" we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This means \\( \\neg C \\) is possible, which aligns with \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
