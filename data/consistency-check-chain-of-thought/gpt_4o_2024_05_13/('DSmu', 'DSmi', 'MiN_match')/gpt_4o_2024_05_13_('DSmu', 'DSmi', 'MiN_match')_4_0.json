            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n**Question 1:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( C \\lor M \\) (where \\( C \\) is \"cookies are in the jar\" and \\( M \\) is \"cookies must be hidden in the pantry\").\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nGiven \\( C \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use disjunctive syllogism:\n- If \\( C \\lor M \\) is true and \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\n- Statement 1: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( C \\lor M \\).\n- Statement 2: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box M \\) (where \\( \\Box M \\) means \"it is necessarily the case that the cookies are hidden in the pantry\").\n\nThe statement \\( \\neg \\Box M \\) means it is not necessarily the case that the cookies are hidden in the pantry, but it does not provide a definitive answer about whether \\( M \\) is true or false. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer \\( C \\) from \\( C \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg \\Box M \\).\n\n**Question 3:**\n- Statement: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg \\Box M \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\neg \\Box M \\), we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This directly translates to \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n**Summary:**\n1. Yes, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n2. No, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n3. Yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
