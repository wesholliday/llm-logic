            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. This implies uncertainty about the location of the jacket. The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that it is not necessarily true that the jacket is in the closet; there is a possibility that it might be elsewhere. Therefore, if it might not be hanging in the closet, it follows that it is not necessarily the case that it must be hanging there. Hence, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities. If it is known that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" this eliminates the possibility that the jacket must be in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair. Thus, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" only suggests a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet; it does not confirm it. Since there remains a possibility that the jacket could still be hanging in the closet (as \"might not\" does not eliminate the possibility that it is), we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair based solely on this information. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be in the closet; it could be elsewhere. This aligns with the idea that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" which acknowledges the possibility of the jacket being in a different location. Thus, if it is not necessarily in the closet, it might not be there, making the inference valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
