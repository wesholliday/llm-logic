            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. If Fido might not be in the garden, it implies uncertainty about his presence in the garden, which aligns with the statement that it is not necessarily the case that he must be there. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" then the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that Fido is inside. Therefore, from these two statements, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. However, the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" only suggests a possibility that Fido is not in the garden; it does not negate the necessity of him being in the garden. Since it does not definitively rule out the possibility that Fido must be in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This aligns with the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden, as it opens up the possibility of his absence. Therefore, from \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
