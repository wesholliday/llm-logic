            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty that the remote control is under the couch. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the idea that it is not certain (or must not be) under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the necessity of the remote being under the couch is negated, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: Similar to Question 2, we have the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" However, the additional information here is \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" which only suggests a possibility that the remote is not under the couch but does not negate the necessity of it being there. Since there remains a possibility (not a certainty) that the remote could still be under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote to be under the couch, which inherently suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. Therefore, from the statement that it is not necessary for the remote to be under the couch, we can infer that it might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
