            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first premise is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). The second premise negates one of the parts of the disjunction. If it is not the case that \"Fido must be in the garden,\" then the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This does not assert that Fido is definitely not in the garden, but it opens up the possibility that he might not be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm it as a certainty. Since the first premise includes the condition that Fido must be in the garden as one of the options, and the second premise does not definitively negate this possibility (it only suggests it might not be true), we cannot conclusively infer from these premises alone that \"Fido is inside.\" There remains a possibility that Fido could still be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not assert this as a certainty. Therefore, it does not necessarily imply that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because the latter would require a definitive exclusion of the possibility of Fido being in the garden. Thus, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
