            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" negates the second possibility. Therefore, by process of elimination, the jacket must be draped over the chair. So, the answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. This does not necessarily mean the jacket is not hanging there, but it opens up the possibility that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. Thus, the answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not confirm this as a fact. Since it's not definitively stated that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet, we cannot conclusively infer that the jacket must be draped over the chair. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 4, the statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" indicates a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. However, this does not necessarily negate the necessity of the jacket hanging in the closet. It merely suggests that there is a possibility of an alternative. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" Thus, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
