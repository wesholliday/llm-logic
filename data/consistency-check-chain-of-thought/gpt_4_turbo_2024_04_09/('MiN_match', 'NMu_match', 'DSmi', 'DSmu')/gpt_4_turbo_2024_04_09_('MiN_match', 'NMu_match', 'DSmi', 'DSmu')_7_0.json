            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is under the couch. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch; it could be elsewhere. This aligns with the idea expressed in \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" which acknowledges the possibility of the remote control being in a different location. Thus, the first statement implies the second.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive possibilities. If we also know \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" this suggests there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch, as \"might not\" does not equate to \"is not.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table just based on these statements.\n\nQuestion 4: Again, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" directly negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
