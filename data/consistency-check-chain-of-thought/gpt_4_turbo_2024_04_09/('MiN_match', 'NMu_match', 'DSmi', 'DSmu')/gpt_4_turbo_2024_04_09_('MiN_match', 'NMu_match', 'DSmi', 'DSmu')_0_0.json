            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This means that it is not certain or necessary that Fido is in the garden.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not a necessity that Fido is in the garden.\n- Therefore, if Fido might not be in the garden, it logically follows that it is not necessary (or a must) that Fido is in the garden.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?\n- The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' indicates that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity; however, it does not exclude the possibility that Fido is in the garden.\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests a possibility of Fido not being in the garden.\n- Since the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated, it opens up the possibility (but does not confirm) that Fido might not be in the garden. Thus, this inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' sets up two possibilities.\n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden.\n- Since it is not confirmed that Fido is definitely not in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that Fido is inside. Fido might still be in the garden despite the possibility of him not being there.\n\nQuestion 4: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' again presents two exclusive options.\n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' confirms that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity.\n- Since Fido being in the garden is not a necessity and these are the only two options presented, it logically follows that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
