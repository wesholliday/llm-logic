            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This implies uncertainty about the location of the cookies, specifically that it is not certain they are in the pantry. The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" directly asserts that it is not a necessity that the cookies are in the pantry. Since the first statement introduces the possibility that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry, it supports the inference in the second statement. Therefore, the answer is \"yes\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry; they could be elsewhere. This directly implies that there is a possibility that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the answer is \"yes\".\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it completely, as \"might not\" suggests a possibility rather than certainty. Since there remains a possibility that the cookies could still be in the pantry, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The cookies are in the jar\" based solely on these statements. Therefore, the answer is \"no\".\n\nQuestion 4: Here again, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"The cookies are in the jar\". Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\". Hence, the answer is \"yes\".\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
