            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not definitively negate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be there. This does not eliminate the possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
