            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility as true. Therefore, if it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then the only remaining option from the original statement is that the milk is on the counter. Thus, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively negate it. The use of \"might not\" indicates a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, but it does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge. Since there remains a possibility that the milk could still be in the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk is on the counter based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
