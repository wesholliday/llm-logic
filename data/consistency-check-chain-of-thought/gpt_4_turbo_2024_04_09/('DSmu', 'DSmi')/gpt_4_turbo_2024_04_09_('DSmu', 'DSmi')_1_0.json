            "content": "For Question 1:\nThe first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). The second premise negates the necessity of the book resting on the table, stating it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This implies that the book being on the table is not a necessity, leaving the possibility that the book is on the shelf as the only necessary condition. Since the disjunction must be true and one part (the necessity of the book being on the table) is negated, the other part (the book is on the shelf) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nFor Question 2:\nThe first premise is the same as in Question 1. However, the second premise here states that the book might not be resting on the table, which implies that there is a possibility of the book not being on the table, but it does not negate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Since this premise does not eliminate the possibility of the book being on the table, it does not necessarily force the conclusion that the book must be on the shelf. The statement \"might not be\" does not exclude the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
