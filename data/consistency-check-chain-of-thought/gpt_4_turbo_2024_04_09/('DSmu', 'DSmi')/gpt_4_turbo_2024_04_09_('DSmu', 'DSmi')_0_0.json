Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 2 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that Fido is inside. Since the second option is negated, the only remaining valid conclusion under the given statements is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not definitively negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden; it only suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This does not eliminate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden as a necessity. Since the necessity of Fido being in the garden is not conclusively negated, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
