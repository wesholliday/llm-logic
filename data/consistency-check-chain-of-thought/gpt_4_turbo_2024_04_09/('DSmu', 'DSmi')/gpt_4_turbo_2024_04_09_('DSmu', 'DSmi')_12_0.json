            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf, leaving the only remaining possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is indeed in the toy box.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. However, the statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" only suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Since this statement does not definitively exclude the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot conclusively infer that the toy must be in the toy box based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, no",
