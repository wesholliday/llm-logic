            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Since there remains a possibility that the book is on the table, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that it is not necessary for the book to be on the table, effectively ruling out the necessity of the book being on the table. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is uncertainty about the book's location, indicating that it is possible for the book not to be on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the book to be on the table. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies a stronger condition, stating that the book definitively cannot be required to be on the table. The possibility (might not) does not equate to a definitive negation of necessity (must not). Therefore, we cannot infer the stronger condition based solely on the possibility. Thus, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
