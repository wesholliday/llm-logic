            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on these statements, because there remains a possibility, however uncertain, that the remote could still be under the couch.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively rules out the second possibility. If it is not the case that the remote must be under the couch, then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not assert this with certainty. The phrase \"might not\" indicates uncertainty and does not equate to a definitive negation of the necessity that it must be hiding there. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" as this would require a stronger, more definitive statement about the impossibility or exclusion of the remote being under the couch.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
