            "content": "To answer these questions, let's analyze each statement and its implications:\n\n**Question 1:**\nThe statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden. Since there remains a possibility that Fido could still be in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Fido is inside\" with certainty.\n\n**Question 2:**\nAgain, the initial statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" directly negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden, leaving the only remaining possibility that Fido is inside. Since the statement that Fido must be in the garden is negated, the only logical conclusion under the given conditions is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n**Question 3:**\nThe statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests uncertainty about Fido's location; it indicates that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not equate to \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which would imply a definite negation of the necessity of Fido being in the garden. \"Might not be\" is about possibility and does not negate the necessity that Fido could still be required to be in the garden. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
