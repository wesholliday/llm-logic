            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The cookies are in the jar\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be in the pantry.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" definitively rules out the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests uncertainty about the location of the cookies in the pantry but does not definitively rule out that they must be hidden there. \"Might not\" implies a possibility but not a certainty, whereas \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" would require a definitive negation of the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry. Therefore, from \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
