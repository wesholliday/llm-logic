            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the milk being in the fridge but does not definitively exclude it. Since there remains a possibility that the milk could still be in the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two exclusive options. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" definitively rules out the fridge as an option. This leaves only the other possibility that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Hence, the answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies uncertainty or possibility about the milk's location, suggesting that it is not necessarily in the fridge. However, this does not equate to \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which would imply a definite assertion that the milk cannot be in the fridge under any circumstances. The original statement only indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer the stronger assertion from the weaker possibility. Thus, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no",
