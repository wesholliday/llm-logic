            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies uncertainty about the sunglasses being on her head but does not definitively exclude the possibility. Since there remains a possibility that the sunglasses could still be on her head, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be on her head.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two exclusive options. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" definitively rules out the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head. This leaves only the other option from the original statement, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not assert this as a certainty. It leaves room for the possibility that the sunglasses could still be on her head. On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" definitively states that the sunglasses being on her head is not a necessity. This aligns with the uncertainty expressed in the first statement, as both acknowledge that the sunglasses being on her head is not certain. Thus, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
