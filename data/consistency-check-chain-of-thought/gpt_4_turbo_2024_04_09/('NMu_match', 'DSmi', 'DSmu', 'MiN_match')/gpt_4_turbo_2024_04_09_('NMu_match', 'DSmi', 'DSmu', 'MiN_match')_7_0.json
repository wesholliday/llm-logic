            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is under the couch. This leaves open the possibility that the remote control might be somewhere else, thus it might not be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we also know \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" this suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch, as \"might not\" implies uncertainty rather than certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we have \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" combined with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The latter statement negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the only remaining option from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" indicates a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not assert this as a certainty. It does not negate the necessity that the remote control could still be under the couch; it only opens up the possibility that it might not be. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" as this would require a definitive negation of the necessity, not just a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
