            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the milk is in the fridge; it could be elsewhere. This logically leads to the possibility that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" since the necessity of its being in the fridge is negated. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" this suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the milk could still be in the fridge (since \"might not\" implies possibility, not certainty). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The milk is on the counter\" just because it might not be in the fridge. The inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge, leaving the only remaining possibility under the given conditions that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not negate the necessity that it could still be in the fridge. The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" is a stronger claim, asserting that it definitely isn't necessary for the milk to be in the fridge. The possibility (might not) does not imply the necessity (must not), so the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
