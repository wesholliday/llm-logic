            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. This does not mean Fido is definitely not in the garden, but rather that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" this suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden, as \"might not\" implies possibility, not certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Fido is inside\" just because he might not be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 3: From the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" combined with \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer that the necessity of Fido being in the garden is false. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the original disjunction, which is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is definitively true that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The possibility (might not) does not equate to a certainty about the necessity (must not). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" based solely on the statement that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
