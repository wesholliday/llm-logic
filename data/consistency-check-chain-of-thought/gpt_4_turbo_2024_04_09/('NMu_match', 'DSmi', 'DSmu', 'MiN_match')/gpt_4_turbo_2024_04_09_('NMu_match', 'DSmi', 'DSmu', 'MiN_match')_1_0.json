            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the book is on the table; it could be elsewhere. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests the possibility that the book is not on the table. Since the first statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table, it opens up the possibility that the book might not be there. Therefore, we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table\" from \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. If we also know \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" this implies there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Since the possibility of the book being on the table is not completely ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The book is on the shelf\" just based on these statements. There remains a possibility that the book is on the table.\n\nQuestion 3: From \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" combined with \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" we understand that the necessity of the book being on the table is negated. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the original disjunction that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" indicates a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the book to be on the table. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table, but it does not directly follow from the possibility that the book might not be on the table, as the book could still possibly be there. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" solely from \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
