            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility as true. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not definitively negate the possibility that the remote control is hiding under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be. Since this does not rule out the possibility of the remote being under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies uncertainty about the location of the remote control under the couch, but does not definitively assert that it is not there. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively states that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. The former statement implies a possibility but does not confirm the absence of necessity. Therefore, we cannot infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
