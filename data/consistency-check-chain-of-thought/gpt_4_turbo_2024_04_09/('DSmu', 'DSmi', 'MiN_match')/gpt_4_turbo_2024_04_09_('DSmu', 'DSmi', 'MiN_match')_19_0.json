            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" does not definitively negate the possibility that the sunglasses must be perched on her head; it only suggests that there is a possibility that they are not. Since this does not rule out the possibility that they must be perched on her head, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on this information.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses, meaning they could either be perched on her head or not. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" which definitively states that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. The possibility that they might not be perched on her head supports the idea that it is not a must for them to be perched on her head. Thus, from \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
