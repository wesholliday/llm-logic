    "system_prompt": "You will see a series of 3 yes/no questions. Think step by step about each question and explain your reasoning. Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas. The first answer is for the first question, the second answer is for the second question, etc. Each answer should be either 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "For Question 1, the first statement is a logical disjunction: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" Since the disjunction states that one of the two conditions must be true, and the second condition is negated, it logically follows that the first condition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the first statement remains the same as in Question 1. However, the second statement is different: \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\" This statement implies a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but it does not definitively negate the possibility that the cat must be playing there. Since there remains a possibility that the cat could still be playing in the bedroom, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The cat is napping on the couch\" based solely on these statements.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\" suggests that there is uncertainty about the cat's activity; it might or might not be playing in the bedroom. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom,\" which definitively states that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom. The first statement does not exclude the possibility that the cat must be playing in the bedroom; it only introduces doubt. Therefore, we cannot infer the definitive negation of necessity from a statement of possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
