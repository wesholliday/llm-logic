            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" just because it might not be under the couch. The remote could still potentially be under the couch.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not confirm this as a fact. The phrase \"might not\" indicates uncertainty, not a definite negation. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would require a definitive negation of the possibility of the remote being under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we combine \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The latter statement definitively negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch. Given the structure of the original statement (either/or), negating one of the options (\"must be hiding under the couch\") logically leads us to conclude the other option must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively states that there is no necessity for the remote to be under the couch. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" as it aligns with the possibility introduced by negating the necessity.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
