            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We are given two statements: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first statement presents a disjunction (either-or scenario) where the book must be in one of two places. The second statement introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table. Since the second statement does not definitively exclude the table as a location for the book, we cannot conclusively infer that the book must be on the shelf. The possibility remains that the book could still be on the table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not assert this as a certainty. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not necessarily true that the book is on the table. These two statements align in meaning; if the book might not be on the table, then it is not a necessity that the book is on the table. Therefore, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: Given the statements \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" we can infer that the book is not necessarily on the table. Since the disjunction requires that one of the conditions be true and the necessity of the book being on the table is negated, the only remaining option from the disjunction is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table, but it does not exclude the possibility of the book being on the table. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" aligns with this as it also suggests a possibility (not a certainty) that the book is not on the table. Thus, from \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
