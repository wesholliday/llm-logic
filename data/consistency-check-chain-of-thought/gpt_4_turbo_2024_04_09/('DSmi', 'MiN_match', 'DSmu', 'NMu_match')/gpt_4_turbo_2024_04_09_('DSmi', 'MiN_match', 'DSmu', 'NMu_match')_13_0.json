            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The first statement is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). The second statement introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge. Since the second statement does not definitively exclude the fridge as a location, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk must be on the counter. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the milk to be in the fridge. The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" would mean that it is not a certainty that the milk is in the fridge. The possibility (might not) does not equate to certainty (must not), so we cannot infer the latter from the former. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we have \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" combined with \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" If it is not the case that the milk must be in the fridge, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge, but it does not exclude the possibility of the milk being in the fridge. However, if it is not necessary that the milk is in the fridge, it logically follows that there is a possibility that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" from \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
