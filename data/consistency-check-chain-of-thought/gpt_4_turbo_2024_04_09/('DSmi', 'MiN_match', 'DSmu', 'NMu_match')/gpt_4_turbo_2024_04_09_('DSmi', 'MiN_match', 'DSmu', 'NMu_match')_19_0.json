            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively exclude it. Since the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head is not completely ruled out, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This contrasts with the statement \"The sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" which implies certainty. By stating that there is a possibility they are not on her head, it directly negates the certainty of them having to be on her head. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: Given the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and the additional information \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" we can eliminate the possibility that the sunglasses must be on her head. This leaves only the other option from the original statement, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This does not automatically mean they are not on her head, but it does imply that there is a possibility that they might not be. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
