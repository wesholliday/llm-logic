            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" negates the second possibility. Since the second option is negated, the only remaining valid option is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not assert this as a certainty. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" definitively states that the keys are not necessarily in the cabinet. While the second statement implies the first, the first statement does not necessarily imply the second because it allows for the possibility that the keys could still be in the cabinet. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. This implies that there is a possibility that the keys might not be in the cabinet. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests a possibility but does not confirm that the keys are definitely not in the cabinet. Since there is still a possibility that the keys could be in the cabinet, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer based solely on these statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that the keys are in the drawer from these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
