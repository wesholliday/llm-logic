            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates the second possibility. Since one of the two must be true and the second possibility is negated, the first must be true. Therefore, the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This does not necessarily negate the possibility that they must be perched on her head, as \"might not\" suggests uncertainty rather than certainty. Therefore, it does not directly infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" definitively states that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Hence, from this statement, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies uncertainty about the sunglasses being on her head but does not definitively negate the possibility. Since the possibility that they must be perched on her head is not completely ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on the possibility that they might not be on her head.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
