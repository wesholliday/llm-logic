            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the second possibility. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out that it must be hiding there. It leaves room for uncertainty. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively states that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, from the possibility that it might not be hiding under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it must not be hiding under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This directly supports the idea that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of the remote control being elsewhere. Thus, we can infer that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since this does not definitively negate the possibility of the remote control being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on this possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
