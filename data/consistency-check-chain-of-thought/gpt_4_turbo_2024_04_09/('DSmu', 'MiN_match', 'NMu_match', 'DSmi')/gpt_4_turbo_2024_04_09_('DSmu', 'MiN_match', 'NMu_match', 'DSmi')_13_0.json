            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the second possibility. Since one of the two must be true and the second is negated, the first must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not completely rule out that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. It only indicates uncertainty, not impossibility. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which would require a definite negation of the necessity.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Hence, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
