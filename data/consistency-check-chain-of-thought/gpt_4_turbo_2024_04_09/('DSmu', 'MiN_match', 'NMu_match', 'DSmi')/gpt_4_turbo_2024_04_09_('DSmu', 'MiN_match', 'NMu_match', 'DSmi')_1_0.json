            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that there are only two possibilities: the book is either on the shelf or it must be on the table. The second premise negates the possibility that the book must be on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. Thus, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not necessarily rule out the possibility that the book must be on the table. It simply states that it's not necessarily always on the table. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively conclude that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" as the book could still possibly be required to be on the table in certain circumstances.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This implies that there is at least one scenario where the book is not on the table. Therefore, from this, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" since the possibility exists.\n\nQuestion 4: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThe second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table. Since the first premise states that the book must either be on the shelf or must be on the table, the possibility that the book might not be on the table does not necessarily eliminate the condition that it could still be on the table. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf just based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
