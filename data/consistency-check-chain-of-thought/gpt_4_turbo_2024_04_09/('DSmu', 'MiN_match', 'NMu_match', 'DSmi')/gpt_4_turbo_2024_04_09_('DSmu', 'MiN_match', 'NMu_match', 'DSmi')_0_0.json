            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the second possibility. Since either one or the other must be true, and it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, it logically follows that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for Fido to be in the garden. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not a certainty that Fido is in the garden. The possibility that Fido might not be in the garden does not rule out that Fido could still be in the garden, just not necessarily so. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot definitively infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" indicates that it is not a certainty or requirement that Fido is in the garden. This implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm Fido's absence from the garden as a certainty. Since the possibility exists that Fido could still be in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' from these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
