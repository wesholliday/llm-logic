            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not negate the possibility that the toy must be sitting there. Since the certainty of the toy being on the bookshelf is not completely ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box based solely on this information.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not a certainty that the toy is on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which is exactly what \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" from \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm that the toy definitely isn't there. It leaves room for the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Therefore, from \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because the latter requires a definitive negation of the toy's presence on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
