            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not definitively negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden; it only suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This does not eliminate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden as a necessity. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside based solely on this information.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity. This logically supports the idea that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of Fido not being in the garden. Therefore, we can infer that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity. It leaves open the possibility that Fido must be in the garden but might not be there at a particular time or under certain conditions. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
