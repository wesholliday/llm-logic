            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" negates the second possibility. Since the second option is negated and the statement is an either/or scenario, the only remaining valid option is that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\" Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not definitively negate the possibility that it must be hanging there. Since this does not rule out the second option entirely (as it still might be hanging in the closet), we cannot definitively conclude that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" based solely on this information.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" indicates that it is not a necessity for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. This implies that there is a possibility where the jacket is not hanging in the closet. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not confirm that it definitely isn't. This does not equate to saying \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which would imply that it definitely cannot be hanging there. Therefore, from the statement that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, we cannot infer that it is necessarily not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
