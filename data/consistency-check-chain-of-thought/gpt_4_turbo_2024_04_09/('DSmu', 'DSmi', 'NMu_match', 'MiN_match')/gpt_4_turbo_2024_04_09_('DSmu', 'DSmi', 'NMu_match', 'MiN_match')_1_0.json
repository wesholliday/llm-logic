            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. However, the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does not definitively negate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Since this does not rule out the possibility that the book must be resting on the table, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that it is not a certainty that the book is resting on the table. This aligns with the idea that \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" which suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, we can infer that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies uncertainty about the book's location, suggesting that it is possible the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the book to be resting on the table. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which would imply a definitive negation of the possibility that the book must be on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
