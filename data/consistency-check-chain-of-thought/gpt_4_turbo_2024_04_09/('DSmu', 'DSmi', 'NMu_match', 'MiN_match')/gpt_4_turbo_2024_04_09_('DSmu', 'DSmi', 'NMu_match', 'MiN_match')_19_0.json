            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates the second possibility. Since the second possibility is negated and the statement is a strict either/or, the only remaining valid option is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not definitively negate the possibility that they must be perched on her head. Since this statement does not conclusively eliminate the second possibility, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on this information.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" definitively negates the necessity of the sunglasses being perched on her head. This implies that there is at least a possibility where the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" indicates a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not rule out the possibility that they could still be necessarily perched on her head in some circumstances. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" as the necessity is not negated by a mere possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
