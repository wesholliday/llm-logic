            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The first premise is a disjunction (either/or statement), and the second premise negates one of the disjuncts. According to the rules of logic, if one disjunct in a disjunction is false, the other must be true. Therefore, since it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, the milk must be on the counter.\n\nQuestion 2: The premises are \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The second premise indicates a possibility (might not), not a certainty. This does not negate the disjunct that the milk must be chilling in the fridge; it only suggests that there is a possibility that it isn't. Since we do not have a definitive negation of the disjunct, we cannot conclude with certainty that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This statement indicates that it is not a necessity for the milk to be chilling in the fridge. From this, we can infer that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, which is what \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" expresses. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion from the premise.\n\nQuestion 4: The premise is \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" This statement suggests a possibility but does not assert that it is necessarily true that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer from this that it is definitively not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, as the statement does not exclude the possibility that the milk could still be chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
