            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the second possibility. If the second possibility is negated, then the first must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not negate the possibility that it must be hiding under the couch. Since the possibility that it must be hiding under the couch is not negated, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty that the remote is under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote might not be under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not confirm that the remote definitely isn't under the couch. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would imply a certainty that the remote is not under the couch. Therefore, from the statement that the remote might not be hiding under the couch, we cannot infer that it definitely isn't under the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
