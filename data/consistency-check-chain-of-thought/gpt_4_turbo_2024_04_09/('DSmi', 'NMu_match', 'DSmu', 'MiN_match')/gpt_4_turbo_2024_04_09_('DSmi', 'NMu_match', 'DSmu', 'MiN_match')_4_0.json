            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be there. Since it's not definitively stated that the cookies are not in the pantry, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" The possibility remains that they might still be in the pantry.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that it is not a necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This directly leads to the inference that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of the cookies being elsewhere.\n\nQuestion 3: From the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" combined with \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" we can infer that the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry is negated. This leaves the only remaining option from the original statement that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not assert that they definitely aren't there. It does not negate the necessity that they could still be required to be in the pantry. Therefore, from \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" as the latter requires a definitive negation of any necessity, not just a possibility.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
