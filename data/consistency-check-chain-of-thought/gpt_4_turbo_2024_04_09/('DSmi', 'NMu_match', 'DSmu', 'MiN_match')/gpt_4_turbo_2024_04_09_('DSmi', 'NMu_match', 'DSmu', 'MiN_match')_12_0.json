            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf but does not eliminate the possibility entirely. Since there is still a possibility that the toy could be on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the toy is on the bookshelf. This logically leads to the conclusion that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" since it is not a certainty. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: From the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" combined with \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we can infer that the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is negated. This leaves the only remaining possibility from the original statement, which is that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" indicates a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not assert that it definitely isn't there. It does not negate the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf; it only suggests it's not certain. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which would require a definitive negation of the necessity. Hence, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
