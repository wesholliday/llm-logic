            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The first statement presents two possibilities, one of which must be true. The second statement suggests that it's possible the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since the second statement does not definitively exclude the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This directly leads to the conclusion that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of the remote being elsewhere. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we combine \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The second statement negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the only remaining option from the first statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not assert this as a certainty. It does not negate the possibility that the remote control must be hiding under the couch; it merely opens up the possibility that it might not be. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would require a definitive exclusion of the remote being under the couch. Thus, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
