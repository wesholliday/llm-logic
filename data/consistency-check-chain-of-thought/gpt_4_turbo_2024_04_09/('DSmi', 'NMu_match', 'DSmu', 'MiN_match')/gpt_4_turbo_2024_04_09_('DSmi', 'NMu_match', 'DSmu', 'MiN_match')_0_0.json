            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm it definitively. Since it's not certain that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that it is not a necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This means that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" Hence, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: From the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" combined with \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we know that the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the original statement, which is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\" Hence, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not assert that Fido definitely cannot be in the garden. It does not negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden; it only suggests uncertainty. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" Hence, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
