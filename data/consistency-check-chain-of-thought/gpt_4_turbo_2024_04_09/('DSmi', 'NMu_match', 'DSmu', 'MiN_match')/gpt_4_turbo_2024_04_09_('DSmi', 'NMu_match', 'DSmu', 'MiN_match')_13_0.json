            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it. Since the first statement requires one of the conditions to be true, and the second statement does not definitively eliminate the fridge as a possibility, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge. This does not mean the milk cannot be in the fridge; it simply means it's not a requirement. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" aligns with this, as it suggests a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, saying it \"might not be\" chilling in the fridge is a weaker claim than saying it \"must not be\" chilling in the fridge. The first statement does not necessarily imply the second, as the second introduces uncertainty rather than negation of necessity. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge, leaving the only remaining necessary condition that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\" The answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 4, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not assert this as a certainty. The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge, which is a stronger statement. The possibility (might not be) does not necessarily imply the negation of necessity (must not be). Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, no",
