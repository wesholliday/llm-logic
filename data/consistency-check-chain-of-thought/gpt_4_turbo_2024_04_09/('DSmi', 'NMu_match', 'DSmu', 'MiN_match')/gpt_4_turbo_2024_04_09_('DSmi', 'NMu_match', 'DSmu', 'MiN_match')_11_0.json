            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" The first statement presents two possibilities, one of which must be true. The second statement suggests that it's possible the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not confirm this as a fact. Since the possibility exists that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it's not certain, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket must be draped over the chair. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be hanging in the closet. This directly leads to the conclusion that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" as this statement simply acknowledges the possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we have \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" combined with \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" The second statement negates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet, leaving the only remaining possibility from the first statement that the jacket is draped over the chair. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" indicates a possibility but does not assert certainty. It does not necessarily imply that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which would be a definitive statement about the jacket's location. The possibility (might not be) does not equate to a certainty (must not be), so we cannot infer the latter from the former. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
