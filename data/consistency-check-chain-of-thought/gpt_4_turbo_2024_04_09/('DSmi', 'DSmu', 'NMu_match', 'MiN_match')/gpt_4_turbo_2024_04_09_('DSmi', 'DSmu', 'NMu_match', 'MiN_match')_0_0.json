            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Fido is inside\" just because he might not be in the garden. There remains a possibility that he could be either inside or in the garden.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden. This implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, which aligns with the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" Thus, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" from \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not rule out the possibility that he could still be in the garden. Therefore, it does not necessarily imply that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" as the latter would require a definitive negation of the necessity of Fido being in the garden. Hence, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
