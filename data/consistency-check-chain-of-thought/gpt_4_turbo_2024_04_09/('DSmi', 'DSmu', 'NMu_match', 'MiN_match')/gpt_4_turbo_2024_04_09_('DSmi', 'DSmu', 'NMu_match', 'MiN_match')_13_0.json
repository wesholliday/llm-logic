            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be chilling there. Since the certainty of the milk not being in the fridge isn't established, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two exclusive options. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" directly negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This logically leads to the possibility that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" since it is not required to be there. Thus, we can infer that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm that it definitely isn't there. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which would imply a definite negation of the necessity of the milk being in the fridge. Therefore, from the possibility alone, we cannot infer the definite absence of necessity.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
