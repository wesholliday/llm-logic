            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on these statements, as there remains a possibility, however slight, that the remote could still be under the couch.\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively eliminates the second possibility, leaving only the first. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that there is no necessity for the remote to be under the couch. However, this does not imply that the remote \"might not be hiding under the couch,\" as it could still possibly be there without it being a necessity. Thus, we cannot infer \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" from this statement alone.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which negates the necessity but not the possibility. Therefore, from \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" as the possibility negates the necessity.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
