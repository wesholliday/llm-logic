            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" because the notebook still might be on the nightstand.\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" definitively rules out the possibility that the notebook has to be on the nightstand. This leaves only the other possibility that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" means that it is not a necessity for the notebook to be on the nightstand. This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which is exactly what \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests. Thus, we can infer that \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could be there. Therefore, it does not necessarily imply that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" which would require ruling out the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand entirely. Hence, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
