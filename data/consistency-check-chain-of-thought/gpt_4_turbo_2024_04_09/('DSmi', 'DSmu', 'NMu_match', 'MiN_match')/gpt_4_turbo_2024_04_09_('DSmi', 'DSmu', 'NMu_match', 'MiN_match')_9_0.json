            "content": "Question 1 Analysis:\nThe statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" implies that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since there remains a possibility that the sock could be under the bed, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be in the laundry basket. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2 Analysis:\nHere, the statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" negates the necessity of the sock being under the bed, leaving the laundry basket as the only remaining option. Thus, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3 Analysis:\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" indicates that there is no necessity for the sock to be under the bed. This does not directly imply that the sock might not be under the bed, as it could still possibly be there without being a necessity. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" from this statement alone. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4 Analysis:\nThe statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed. This implies that it is not necessarily under the bed. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
