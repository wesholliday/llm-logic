            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The book is on the shelf\" just because it might not be on the table. There remains a possibility that the book is still on the table.\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving the only remaining necessary condition that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table, but it does not rule out the possibility of the book being on the table. However, saying \"The book might not be resting on the table\" is a weaker statement that simply acknowledges the possibility of the book not being on the table. Since the necessity of the book being on the table is negated, it logically follows that it might not be on the table. Thus, we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not negate the necessity of the book being on the table. It leaves open the possibility that the book could still necessarily be on the table. Therefore, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" as the necessity could still exist.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
