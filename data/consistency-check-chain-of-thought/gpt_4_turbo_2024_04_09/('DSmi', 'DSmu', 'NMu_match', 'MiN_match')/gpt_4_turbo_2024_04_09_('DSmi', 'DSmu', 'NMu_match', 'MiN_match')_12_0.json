            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be there. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box\" solely based on these statements, as the toy still might be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf, leaving the only remaining possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf; however, it does not exclude the possibility of the toy being there. The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" is a weaker claim, merely suggesting a possibility of the toy not being there. Since the necessity (must) is negated, it logically follows that the possibility (might not) is true. Therefore, we can infer \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" indicates a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not assert that the toy definitely isn't there. The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. The possibility (might not) does not necessarily imply the negation of necessity (must not), as the toy could still possibly be there without it being a necessity. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" based solely on the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, no",
