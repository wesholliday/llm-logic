            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?\n- If \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" it implies there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This statement suggests uncertainty about Fido's location. \n- \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not necessary or certain that Fido is in the garden.\n- Since the first statement introduces the possibility of Fido not being in the garden, it logically supports the idea that Fido's presence in the garden is not a necessity. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- The first statement is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario) where either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden.\n- Given that Fido being in the garden is negated, the only remaining valid option from the disjunction is that Fido is inside. Thus, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?\n- \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" indicates that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden.\n- \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests the possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- Since there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden, it is logically possible that Fido might not be in the garden. Hence, we can infer the possibility from the lack of necessity.\n\nQuestion 4: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- The first statement again presents a logical disjunction where either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden.\n- The second statement, \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" introduces a possibility but does not confirm Fido's absence from the garden.\n- Since the second statement does not definitively negate Fido's presence in the garden (it only suggests it as a possibility), we cannot conclusively infer from these premises that Fido is inside. The possibility that Fido might not be in the garden does not eliminate the scenario where Fido could still be in the garden.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
