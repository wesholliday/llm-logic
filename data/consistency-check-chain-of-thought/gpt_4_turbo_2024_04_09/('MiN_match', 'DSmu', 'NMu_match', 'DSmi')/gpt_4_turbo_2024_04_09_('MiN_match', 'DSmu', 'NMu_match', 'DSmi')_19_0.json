            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses are on her head. Both statements align in that neither confirms the sunglasses are definitely on her head. Therefore, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" then the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\" Thus, this can be inferred.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head, which means they might or might not be there. This aligns with the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" which also acknowledges the possibility of the sunglasses not being on her head. Therefore, we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests a possibility but does not confirm the absence of the sunglasses on her head. Since it does not eliminate the possibility that the sunglasses could still be perched on her head, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" based solely on the possibility they might not be. This requires certainty, not just a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
