            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is under the couch. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the necessity of it being under the couch is ruled out, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch; it could be elsewhere. This aligns with the idea that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" which acknowledges the possibility of the remote control not being under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the third statement from the second.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since this does not definitively rule out the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that it must be on the coffee table based solely on this possibility. Therefore, we cannot make a definite inference that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
