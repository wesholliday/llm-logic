            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not necessarily true that the keys are in the cabinet. Both statements align in that neither confirms the keys must be in the cabinet. Therefore, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. If it is not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, then the only remaining possibility from the given options is that the keys are in the drawer. Thus, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet; they could be elsewhere. This aligns with the possibility that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" which also acknowledges that the keys could be elsewhere. Therefore, from the third statement, we can infer the fourth.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces uncertainty about the keys being in the cabinet but does not eliminate the possibility entirely. Since it does not confirm that the keys are definitely not in the cabinet, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys must be in the drawer based solely on the possibility that they might not be in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
