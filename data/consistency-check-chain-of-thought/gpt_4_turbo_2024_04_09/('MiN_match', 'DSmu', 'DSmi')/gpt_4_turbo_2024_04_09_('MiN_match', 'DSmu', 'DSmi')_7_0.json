            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is definitely under the couch. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the necessity of the remote being under the couch is ruled out, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since this statement does not definitively rule out the remote being under the couch (as it only speaks to a possibility, not a certainty), we cannot conclusively infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
