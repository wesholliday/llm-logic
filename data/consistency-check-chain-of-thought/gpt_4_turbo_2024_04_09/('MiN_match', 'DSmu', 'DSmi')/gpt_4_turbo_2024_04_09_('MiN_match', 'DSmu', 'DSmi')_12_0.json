            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which means that it is not necessarily true that the toy is on the bookshelf. The first statement suggests uncertainty about the toy's location, while the second statement denies the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf. Therefore, if it might not be on the bookshelf, it follows that it is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" then the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is negated. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the original statement, which is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not negate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Since this statement does not eliminate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf as a necessity, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy must be in the toy box based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
