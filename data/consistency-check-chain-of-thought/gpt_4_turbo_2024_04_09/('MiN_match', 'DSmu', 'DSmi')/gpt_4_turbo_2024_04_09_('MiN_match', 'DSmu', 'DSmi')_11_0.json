            "content": "To answer these questions, let's analyze each statement and its implications:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. This does not confirm the jacket's location but indicates uncertainty about it being in the closet. The inference \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that it is not necessarily true that the jacket is in the closet. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the jacket is not in the closet, it supports the inference that it is not necessarily in the closet. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities. If it is known that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" this eliminates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet, leaving the only other option provided by the original statement: the jacket being draped over the chair. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" only suggests a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet but does not confirm it. Since there remains a possibility (not a certainty) that the jacket could still be in the closet, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket must be draped over the chair based solely on the possibility that it might not be hanging in the closet. Therefore, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
