            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm it. The phrase \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not necessarily true that the book is on the table. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, it aligns with the idea that the book's presence on the table is not a necessity. Therefore, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" this negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, from these two statements, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm it as a certainty. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table (it only suggests it might not be), we cannot conclusively infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on these statements. The possibility remains that the book could still be on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
