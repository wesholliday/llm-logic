            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This implies uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not a certainty or requirement that the sunglasses are on her head. Since the first statement introduces the possibility that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head, it supports the inference that it is not mandatory for the sunglasses to be on her head. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" eliminates the second possibility, leaving only the first. Since the second option (that the sunglasses must be on her head) is negated, the only remaining possibility under the given conditions is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" introduces a possibility but does not confirm the absence of the sunglasses on her head as a certainty. It merely suggests that there is a chance they are not on her head, but does not rule out that they could still be there. Since this does not definitively negate the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head, we cannot conclusively infer that they must be in her bag based solely on this possibility. Therefore, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
