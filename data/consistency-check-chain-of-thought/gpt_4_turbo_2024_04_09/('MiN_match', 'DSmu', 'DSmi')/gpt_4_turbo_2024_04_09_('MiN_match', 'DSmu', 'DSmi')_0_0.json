            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not necessary or certain that Fido is in the garden.\n- Since 'might not' introduces a possibility of Fido not being in the garden, it contradicts the necessity implied by 'must be'. Therefore, if Fido might not be in the garden, it logically follows that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- The first statement presents a disjunction: either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden.\n- The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction, stating that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n- Since the second part of the disjunction is negated, the only remaining valid option from the disjunction is that Fido is inside.\n- Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- The first statement is a disjunction similar to the previous question.\n- The second statement, 'Fido might not be in the garden', introduces a possibility but does not confirm Fido's location. It does not negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden; it only suggests that there is a chance he might not be.\n- Since 'might not be' does not definitively negate the condition that Fido must be in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer from these statements alone that Fido is inside. There remains a possibility that Fido could still be in the garden as required by the 'must be' condition.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
