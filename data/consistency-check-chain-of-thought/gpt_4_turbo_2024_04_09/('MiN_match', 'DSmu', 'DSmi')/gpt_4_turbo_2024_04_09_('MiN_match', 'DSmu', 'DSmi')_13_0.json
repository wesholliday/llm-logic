            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This implies uncertainty about the milk's chilling status. The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not necessarily true that the milk is chilling in the fridge; there is a possibility that it might not be. Since the first statement introduces a possibility of the milk not chilling, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily chilling. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" then the necessity of the milk chilling in the fridge is negated. This leaves the only other possibility presented in the initial statement, which is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional information \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" only suggests a possibility that the milk is not chilling; it does not confirm it. Since this does not definitively negate the possibility of the milk chilling in the fridge (as it still might be chilling), we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
