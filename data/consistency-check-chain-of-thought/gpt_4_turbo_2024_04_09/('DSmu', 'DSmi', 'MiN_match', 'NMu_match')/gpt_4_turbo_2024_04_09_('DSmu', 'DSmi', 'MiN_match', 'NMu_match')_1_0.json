            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does not definitively negate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This does not eliminate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table, so we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm that the book definitely is not on the table. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not a necessity that the book is on the table. Since \"might not\" introduces uncertainty but does not negate necessity, we cannot infer from \"The book might not be resting on the table\" that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not necessary for the book to be on the table. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
