            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a logical disjunction. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" negates the second part of the disjunction. According to the rules of disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true to satisfy the overall statement. Therefore, since it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, Fido must be inside. Thus, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is again considered. The second statement, \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" implies a possibility that Fido is not in the garden but does not confirm it as a certainty. Since the disjunction requires only one true statement for the whole to be true, and \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not definitively negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that 'Fido is inside' based solely on the possibility.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not assert with certainty that Fido cannot be in the garden. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" definitively states that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity. The possibility (might not) does not equate to a definitive negation (must not), so we cannot infer the latter from the former.\n\nQuestion 4: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity; it is not required that he be there. This implies that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from the statement that Fido must not be in the garden, we can infer that 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
