            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" does not definitively negate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf; it only suggests that it's possible for the toy not to be there. Since this does not rule out the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This does not equate to \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which would require a definitive negation of the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf. Therefore, from \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which aligns with the statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" Therefore, from \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we can infer \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
