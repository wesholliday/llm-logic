            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements:\n1. \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know there are only two possibilities for the location of the remote control. The second statement negates one of these possibilities (that it must be hiding under the couch). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statements are:\n1. \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe second statement here indicates a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not negate the possibility that it could still be there (as \"might not\" implies uncertainty, not certainty). Since there remains a possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it is on the coffee table based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement is:\n\"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not assert this as a definite fact (it does not rule out that the remote control could still be under the couch). Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement alone that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because the latter would require a definitive negation of the possibility that the remote control is under the couch.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement is:\n\"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThis statement definitively negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch. It implies that there is no obligation or certainty that the remote control is under the couch, which inherently suggests that there is a possibility it might not be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
