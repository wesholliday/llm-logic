            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates the second possibility. Since one of the two must be true and the second possibility is negated, the only remaining valid option is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not definitively negate the possibility that they must be perched on her head. Since the possibility that they must be perched on her head is not definitively ruled out, we cannot conclusively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on this information.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not assert this as a certainty. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not a necessity that the sunglasses are on her head. The possibility that they might not be perched on her head supports the idea that it is not a necessity, so we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" indicates that it is not a requirement for the sunglasses to be on her head. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
