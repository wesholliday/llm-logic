            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" again presents two possibilities. However, the additional statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" does not definitively negate the possibility that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand; it only suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not there. Since this does not rule out the possibility that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not necessarily mean that it cannot definitively be there. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that it is definitely not true that the notebook must be on the nightstand. Since the possibility (might not) does not equate to a definitive negation (must not), we cannot infer the latter from the former.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" means that it is not a certainty that the notebook is on the nightstand. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
