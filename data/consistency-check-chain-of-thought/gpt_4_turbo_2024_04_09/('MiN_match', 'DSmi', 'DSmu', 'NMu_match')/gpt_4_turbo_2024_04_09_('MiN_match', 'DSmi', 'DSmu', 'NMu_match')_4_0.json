            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This implies uncertainty about the location of the cookies in the pantry. The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that it is not necessarily true that the cookies are definitely in the pantry. Since the first statement introduces a possibility of the cookies not being in the pantry, it supports the idea that it is not a certainty (or a must) that the cookies are in the pantry. Therefore, from \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" this implies there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be in the pantry; it only suggests that it's not certain. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The cookies are in the jar\" just because they might not be in the pantry, as they still could be there.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we have \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" The second statement negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry, leaving the only remaining option from the first statement that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is no necessity for the cookies to be in the pantry. This aligns with the idea that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" which suggests a possibility of the cookies not being in the pantry. Thus, from \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" we can infer \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
