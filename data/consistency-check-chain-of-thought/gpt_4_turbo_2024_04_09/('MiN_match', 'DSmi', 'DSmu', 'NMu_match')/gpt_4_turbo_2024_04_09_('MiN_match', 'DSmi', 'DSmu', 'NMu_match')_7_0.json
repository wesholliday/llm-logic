            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is under the couch. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch but does not eliminate the possibility. Since there remains a possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, we have \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This time, it is combined with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch. Since the necessity of the remote being under the couch is negated, the only remaining option from the original statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch, but it does not necessarily imply that the remote control might not be there. It only negates the certainty of its location under the couch. However, saying \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" is a direct implication that it is possible for the remote not to be under the couch, which is consistent with the negation of necessity. Thus, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" from \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
