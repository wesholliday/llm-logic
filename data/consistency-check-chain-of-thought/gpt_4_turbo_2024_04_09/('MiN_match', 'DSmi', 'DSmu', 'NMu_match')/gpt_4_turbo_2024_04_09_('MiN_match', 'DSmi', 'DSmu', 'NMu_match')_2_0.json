            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not necessarily true that the keys are in the cabinet. Both statements align in that they deny the certainty of the keys being in the cabinet. Therefore, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces uncertainty about the keys being in the cabinet but does not eliminate the possibility entirely. Since the possibility of the keys dangling in the cabinet is not ruled out completely, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys must be in the drawer. Thus, the inference \"The keys are in the drawer\" cannot be made solely based on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, we have \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This time, it is combined with \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet. This leaves the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet, which inherently suggests the possibility that the keys might not be there. Thus, from this statement, we can infer \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
