            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. If Fido might not be in the garden, it implies that there is uncertainty about Fido's presence in the garden, which aligns with the idea that it is not a necessity (must) for Fido to be in the garden. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" introduces uncertainty about Fido being in the garden but does not completely rule out the possibility. Since there remains a possibility (however slight) that Fido could still be in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside just based on these statements. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" solely from these premises.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" directly negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, leaving the only remaining option from the original statement that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden, but it does not necessarily imply that Fido might not be in the garden. Fido could still possibly be in the garden without it being a necessity. Therefore, from \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we cannot infer \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
