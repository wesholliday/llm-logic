            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" implies that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack. The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" means that it is not necessarily true that the scarf is on the coat rack. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack, it logically supports the second statement that the scarf does not have to be on the coat rack. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" suggests that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since the possibility that the scarf is on the coat rack is not completely ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\" Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, the statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" definitively rules out the necessity of the scarf being on the coat rack. This leaves only the other possibility that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" as the remaining option. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" means that there is no necessity for the scarf to be on the coat rack, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could still be there. The statement \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" implies uncertainty about the scarf's location, which is consistent with the lack of necessity. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
