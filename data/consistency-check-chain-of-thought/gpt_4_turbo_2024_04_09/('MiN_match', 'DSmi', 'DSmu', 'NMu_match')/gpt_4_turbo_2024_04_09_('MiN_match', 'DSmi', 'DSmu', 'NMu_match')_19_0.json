            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that it is not a necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. Both statements align in indicating that having the sunglasses on her head is not a requirement. Therefore, from the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional information \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" introduces uncertainty about the sunglasses being on her head but does not completely rule it out. Since there remains a possibility, albeit uncertain, that the sunglasses could still be perched on her head, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be on her head.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two exclusive options. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" definitively rules out the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head. This leaves only the other option from the exclusive pair, which is that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" indicates that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This logically implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, from \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
