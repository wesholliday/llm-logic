            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: From 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge'?\n- The statement 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. \n- 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' means that it is not necessarily true that the milk is chilling in the fridge; there is a possibility that it might not be.\n- Since the first statement opens the possibility that the milk is not chilling, it aligns with the idea that it is not a necessity (must) that the milk is chilling. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?\n- 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' sets up a condition where one of the two must be true.\n- 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, but it does not confirm it. Therefore, it does not eliminate the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge.\n- Since the possibility that the milk is chilling in the fridge is not ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling. Thus, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' together with 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', can we infer 'The milk is on the counter'?\n- 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' again sets up a condition where one of the two must be true.\n- 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' confirms that it is not necessary for the milk to be chilling in the fridge, which effectively rules out the necessity of the milk chilling in the fridge.\n- Since the necessity of the milk chilling in the fridge is ruled out, and given the either/or condition, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
