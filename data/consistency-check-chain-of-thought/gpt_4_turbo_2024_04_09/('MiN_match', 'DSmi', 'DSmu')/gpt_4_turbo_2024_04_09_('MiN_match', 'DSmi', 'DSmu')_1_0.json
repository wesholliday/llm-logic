            "content": "Question 1 Analysis:\nThe statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm it. This implies uncertainty about the book's location. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not necessarily true that the book is on the table. Since the first statement introduces the possibility that the book might not be on the table, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily on the table. Therefore, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 2 Analysis:\nThe statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table but does not eliminate the possibility entirely. Since there is still a chance that the book could be on the table, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based solely on these statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" just because it might not be resting on the table.\n\nQuestion 3 Analysis:\nAgain, we have \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" definitively rules out the necessity of the book being on the table. Since this necessity is ruled out, and the only other option presented is that the book is on the shelf, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
