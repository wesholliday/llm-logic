            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This implies uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses. The phrase \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not a certainty or requirement that the sunglasses are on her head. Since the first statement introduces the possibility that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head, it supports the inference that it is not mandatory for the sunglasses to be on her head. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nFor Question 2, we have two statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" The first statement presents a strict dichotomy, but the second statement only suggests a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, not a certainty. Since the second statement does not definitively rule out the possibility that the sunglasses are on her head, we cannot conclusively infer that they must be in her bag based solely on the possibility that they might not be on her head. Therefore, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statements are: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" The second statement definitively rules out the condition that the sunglasses must be on her head. Given the dichotomy in the first statement, if it is not the case that the sunglasses must be on her head, the only remaining option from the dichotomy is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. The answer is \"yes.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
