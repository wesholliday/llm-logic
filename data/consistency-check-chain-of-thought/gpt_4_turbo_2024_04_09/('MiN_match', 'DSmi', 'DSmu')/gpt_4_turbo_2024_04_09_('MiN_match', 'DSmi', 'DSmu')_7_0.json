            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The inference \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is definitely under the couch. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the inference that the remote control does not necessarily have to be under the couch. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch but does not completely eliminate this possibility. Since there remains a possibility (however uncertain) that the remote could still be under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: Again, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" directly negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
