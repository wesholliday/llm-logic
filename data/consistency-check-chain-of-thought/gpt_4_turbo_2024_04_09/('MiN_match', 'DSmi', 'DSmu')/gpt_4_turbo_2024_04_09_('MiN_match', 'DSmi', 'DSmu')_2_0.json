Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which asserts that it is not necessarily true that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. Both statements align in suggesting that there is no certainty or necessity about the keys dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, from the first statement, we can infer the second.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces uncertainty about the keys dangling in the cabinet but does not completely rule it out as a possibility. Since there remains a possibility that the keys could still be dangling in the cabinet, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer based solely on the provided statements.\n\nFor Question 3, similar to Question 2, the statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" sets up a dichotomy. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet, leaving the only remaining possibility under the given conditions that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
