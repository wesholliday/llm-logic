            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" The first statement is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). The second statement introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it. Since the second statement does not definitively exclude the fridge as a location (it only suggests it might not be there), we cannot conclusively infer that the milk must be on the counter. The possibility remains that the milk could still be in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This directly leads to the conclusion that it is not necessarily true that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge. This logically implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, which is exactly what \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" states. Therefore, we can infer this statement from the given premise.\n\nQuestion 4: Here, we have \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" combined with \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" Since it is established that the milk does not necessarily have to be in the fridge, and the only other given alternative is that the milk is on the counter, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
