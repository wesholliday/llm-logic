            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively exclude it. Since there remains a possibility, however slight, that the cookies could still be in the pantry, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. This directly implies that it is not necessarily true that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" means that it is not a certainty that the cookies are in the pantry. This logically implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, which is exactly what \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests. Therefore, we can infer this statement from the given premise.\n\nQuestion 4: From the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and the additional information \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" we can conclude that the only remaining valid option is that the cookies are in the jar. Since the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry is negated, the alternative (cookies in the jar) must be true.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
