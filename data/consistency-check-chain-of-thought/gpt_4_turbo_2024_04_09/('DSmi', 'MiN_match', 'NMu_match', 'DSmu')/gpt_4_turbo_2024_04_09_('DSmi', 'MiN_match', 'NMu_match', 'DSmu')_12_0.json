            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm it definitively. Since the first statement is an \"either/or\" condition and the second statement does not conclusively eliminate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" The toy might still be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is uncertainty about the toy's location on the bookshelf; it is not definite. This directly leads to the conclusion that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because if it were a must, there would be no uncertainty.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" indicates that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This logically implies that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" because if it's not a must, then it's possible that the toy is not there.\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and the additional information \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we can conclude that the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is ruled out. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the \"either/or\" condition, which is that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
