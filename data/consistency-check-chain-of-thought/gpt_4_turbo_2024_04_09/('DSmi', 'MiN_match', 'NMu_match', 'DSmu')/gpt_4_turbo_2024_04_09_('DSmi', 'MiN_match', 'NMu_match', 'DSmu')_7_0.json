            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" because the possibility of it being under the couch still exists.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This directly implies that it is not necessarily true that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. Hence, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not a certainty or requirement that the remote control is under the couch. This directly supports the idea that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" as it aligns with the notion that there is no necessity for the remote to be under the couch.\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and the additional information \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" we can eliminate the necessity of the remote being under the couch. Since the necessity of the second option is negated, the only remaining possibility under the given conditions is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
