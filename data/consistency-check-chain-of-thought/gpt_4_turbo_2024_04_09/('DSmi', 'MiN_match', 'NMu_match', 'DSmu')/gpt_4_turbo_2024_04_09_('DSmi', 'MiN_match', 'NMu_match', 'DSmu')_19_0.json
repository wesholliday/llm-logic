            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not confirm this as a fact. Since the statement does not definitively exclude the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\" The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty rather than certainty.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" which definitively states that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. The first statement does not confirm the absence of the sunglasses on her head; it only acknowledges the possibility. Therefore, from \"might not be,\" we cannot definitively infer \"must not be.\"\n\nQuestion 3: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" clearly states that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This directly supports the idea that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of the sunglasses not being on her head. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" from \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" definitively rules out the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head. Since this necessity is ruled out, the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: no, no, yes, yes",
