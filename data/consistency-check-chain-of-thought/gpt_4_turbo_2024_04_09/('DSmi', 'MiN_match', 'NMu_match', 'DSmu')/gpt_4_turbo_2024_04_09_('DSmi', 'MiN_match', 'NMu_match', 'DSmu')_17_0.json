            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively exclude it. Since the possibility that the notebook is on the nightstand is not completely ruled out, we cannot conclusively infer that the notebook must be in the drawer. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This directly supports the inference \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" which means it is not necessarily true that the notebook is on the nightstand. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" means that it is not a certainty that the notebook is on the nightstand. This directly implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which is exactly what \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" rules out the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand, leaving the only remaining possibility that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
