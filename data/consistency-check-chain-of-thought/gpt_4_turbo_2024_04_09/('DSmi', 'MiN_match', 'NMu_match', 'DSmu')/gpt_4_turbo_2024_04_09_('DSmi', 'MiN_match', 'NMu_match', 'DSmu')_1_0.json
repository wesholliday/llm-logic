            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table but does not definitively exclude it. Since there remains a possibility, however slight, that the book could still be on the table, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This directly supports the inference \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" because if the book must be resting on the table, there would be no possibility of it not being there.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that it is not a certainty that the book is on the table. This logically supports the inference \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of the book not being on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
