            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the milk being in the fridge but does not definitively exclude it. Since \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" just because it might not be in the fridge. It still could be in the fridge.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which definitively states that the milk does not necessarily have to be in the fridge. From \"might not,\" we can infer that it is not necessarily true that the milk must be in the fridge, aligning with the meaning of \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nFor Question 3, combining \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" with \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" leads to a direct inference. If it is not a necessity that the milk is in the fridge, and the only other given option is that the milk is on the counter, then logically, the milk must be on the counter. This is because the alternative (the milk must be in the fridge) has been negated, leaving only the other possibility.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
