            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively eliminate it. Since \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" just because they might not be on her head. They still could be on her head, despite the uncertainty.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This directly implies that it is not definitively true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nFor Question 3, combining \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" with \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" directly eliminates the second possibility, leaving only the first. If it is not the case that the sunglasses must be on her head, then the only remaining option from the original statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Thus, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
