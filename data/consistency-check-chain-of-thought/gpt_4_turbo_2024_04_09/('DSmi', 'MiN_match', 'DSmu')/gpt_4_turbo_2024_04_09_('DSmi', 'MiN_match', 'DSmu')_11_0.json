            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not confirm its falsehood. Since \"might not be\" does not definitively negate the possibility of the jacket hanging in the closet, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This directly implies that it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. Hence, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 3, given the statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" and the additional information \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair. Since the necessity of the jacket hanging in the closet is negated, the alternative must be true. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
