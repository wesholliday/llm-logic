            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is uncertainty about the book being on the table but does not definitively exclude the possibility. Since the possibility of the book being on the table is not completely ruled out, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This contrasts with the statement \"The book must be resting on the table,\" which would imply no other possibility exists but that the book is on the table. Since \"might not\" introduces uncertainty and does not confirm the book's location as being on the table, it logically follows that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Hence, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
