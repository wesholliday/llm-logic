            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that it is not certain that Fido is in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that he could be there. Since there remains a possibility that Fido could be in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is uncertainty about Fido's presence in the garden. This directly contradicts the assertion that \"Fido must be in the garden,\" which would imply certainty of his presence there. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nFor Question 3, combining \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" with \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" leaves us with only one remaining possibility from the original disjunction. If it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, then the only remaining option from the original statement is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
