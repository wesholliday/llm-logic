            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" introduces uncertainty about the notebook being on the nightstand but does not definitively exclude it. Since there remains a possibility that the notebook could still be on the nightstand, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be on the nightstand.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This directly leads to the conclusion that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" because if it were a must, there would be no possibility of it not being there. Thus, the inference is valid.\n\nFor Question 3, combining \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" with \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" eliminates the possibility that the notebook must be on the nightstand. This leaves only the other option from the original statement, which is that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
