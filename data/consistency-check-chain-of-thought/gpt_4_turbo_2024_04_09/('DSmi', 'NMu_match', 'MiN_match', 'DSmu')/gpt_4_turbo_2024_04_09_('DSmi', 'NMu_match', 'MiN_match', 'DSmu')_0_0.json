            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The first premise is a disjunction that states Fido is either inside or definitely in the garden. The second premise introduces a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that he could still be in the garden. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside\" solely based on these premises, as there remains a possibility, however slight, that Fido could still be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 2: The premise \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean Fido is not in the garden, but it does mean that his being in the garden is not a certainty. Therefore, it logically follows that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" since this statement aligns with the lack of necessity for Fido's presence in the garden.\n\nQuestion 3: The premise \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not strictly imply that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because the possibility (might not) does not negate the necessity (must). Fido might still be required to be in the garden, even if there's a chance he isn't. Thus, we cannot infer the suggested conclusion from the premise provided.\n\nQuestion 4: Here, the premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, leaving the only remaining option from the disjunction that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\" based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
