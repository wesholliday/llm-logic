            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The first statement presents two possibilities, one of which must be true. The second statement suggests that it's possible the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not confirm this as a fact. Since the second statement does not definitively exclude the possibility of the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table. It remains a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This does not directly translate to \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" which suggests a possibility but not a necessity. The original statement negates a necessity, not the possibility, so we cannot infer the suggested conclusion directly.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be under the couch at all (as would be implied by \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\"). The original statement allows for uncertainty, but does not negate the necessity that the remote could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer the suggested conclusion.\n\nQuestion 4: Here, we have \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" combined with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" The second statement negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the only remaining option from the first statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no, no, no, yes",
