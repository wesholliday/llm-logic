            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" The first statement presents a disjunction (either-or scenario) where the book must be in one of two places. The second statement introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table but does not confirm it. Since the possibility exists that the book is not on the table, but it is not certain, we cannot definitively conclude that the book must be on the shelf. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The book is on the shelf\" with certainty.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. This does not necessarily mean the book isn't on the table; it just means it's not required to be there. However, from this, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table\" because the possibility is open that the book is elsewhere.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This aligns with the idea that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which states there is no necessity for the book to be on the table. Thus, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: We have the statements \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" The second statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving the only other option provided by the first statement, which is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes, yes",
