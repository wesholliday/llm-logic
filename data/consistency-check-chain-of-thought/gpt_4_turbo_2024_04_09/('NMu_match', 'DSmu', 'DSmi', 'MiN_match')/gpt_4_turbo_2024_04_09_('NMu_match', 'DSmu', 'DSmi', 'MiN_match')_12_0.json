            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf; it could be elsewhere. This logically leads to the possibility that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" since it is not required to be there. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf, leaving the only remaining possibility that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Thus, this inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be there. Since the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is not negated (it still might be there), we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Therefore, this inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy must be there under certain conditions or contexts. This statement alone does not negate the necessity (must) of the toy being on the bookshelf; it only introduces uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be there. Thus, this inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
