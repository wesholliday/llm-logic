            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is under the couch. This leaves open the possibility that the remote control might be somewhere else, thus it might not be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" eliminates the second possibility (that it must be hiding under the couch). This leaves only the first possibility, that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: Here, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not definitively eliminate the possibility that the remote control is under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be there. Since there remains a possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could be there. This is different from saying \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which definitively states that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, from \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
