            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the cookies are hidden in the pantry. This means there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility valid. Thus, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that they could be in the pantry. Since this does not definitively negate the second possibility, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is definitively true that the cookies must not be hidden in the pantry. The statement allows for the possibility that the cookies could still be in the pantry, just not necessarily so. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
