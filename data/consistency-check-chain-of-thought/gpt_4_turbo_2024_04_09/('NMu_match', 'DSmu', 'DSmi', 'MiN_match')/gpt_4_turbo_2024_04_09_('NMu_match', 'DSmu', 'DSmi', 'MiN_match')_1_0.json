            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table; however, it does not rule out the possibility that the book could still be on the table. The inference \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that it is possible that the book is not on the table. Since the necessity is negated but the possibility (that the book might not be on the table) remains, this inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the necessity of the book being on the table, leaving the only remaining possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: Similar to Question 2, we have \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm it. Since there remains a possibility that the book could still be on the table, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based solely on the possibility that it might not be on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which negates the necessity of the book being on the table but does not negate its actual presence. However, if it is possible that the book is not on the table, then it cannot be necessarily on the table. Therefore, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
