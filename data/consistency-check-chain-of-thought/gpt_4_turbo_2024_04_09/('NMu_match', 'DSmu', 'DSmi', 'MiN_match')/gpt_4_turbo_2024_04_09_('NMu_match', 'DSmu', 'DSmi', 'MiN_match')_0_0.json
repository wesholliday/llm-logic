            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden. This means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests the possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Since the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated, it opens up the possibility that he might not be there. Therefore, we can infer \"Fido might not be in the garden\" from \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not negate the possibility that he must be in the garden (as it only suggests a possibility, not a certainty). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude \"Fido is inside\" based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden; it only suggests that it is not certain. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot definitively infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
