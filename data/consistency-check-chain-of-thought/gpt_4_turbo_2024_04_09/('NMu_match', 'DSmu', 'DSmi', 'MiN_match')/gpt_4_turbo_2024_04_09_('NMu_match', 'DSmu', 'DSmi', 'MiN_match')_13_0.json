            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the milk is in the fridge; it could be elsewhere. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests the possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Since the necessity (must) of the milk being in the fridge is negated, it opens up the possibility that the milk might not be there. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not negate the possibility that the milk could still be in the fridge. Since there remains a possibility (not a certainty) that the milk could be in the fridge, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based solely on the possibility that it might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not necessarily true that the milk is in the fridge. The possibility that the milk might not be in the fridge supports the idea that it is not necessarily in the fridge. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
