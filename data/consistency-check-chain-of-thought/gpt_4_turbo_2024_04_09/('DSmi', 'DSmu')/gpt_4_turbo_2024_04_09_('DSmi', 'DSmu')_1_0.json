            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not definitively exclude the table as a location for the book. Since it's still possible that the book is on the table, we cannot conclusively infer that the book must be on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is \"no.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" definitively rules out the table as a necessary location for the book. This leaves only the other possibility that the book is on the shelf. Since the table option is excluded as a necessity, the only remaining option under the given condition is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer to Question 2 is \"yes.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
