            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as \"might not\" implies a possibility but not certainty. Since there remains a possibility that the remote control could still be under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively eliminates the possibility of the remote control being under the couch. Since this possibility is ruled out, the only remaining possibility under the initial statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
