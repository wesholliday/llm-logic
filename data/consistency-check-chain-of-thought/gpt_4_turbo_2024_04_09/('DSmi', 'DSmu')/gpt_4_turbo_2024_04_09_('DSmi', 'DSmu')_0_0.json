            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities: Fido being inside or definitely being in the garden. The additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that it is not certain that Fido is in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Since there remains a possibility that Fido could be in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside. Therefore, from these statements, we cannot infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" definitively rules out the possibility that Fido is necessarily in the garden. This leaves only the other possibility from the original statement, which is that Fido is inside. Since the possibility of Fido necessarily being in the garden is negated, the only remaining valid conclusion under the given conditions is that Fido is inside. Therefore, from these statements, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
