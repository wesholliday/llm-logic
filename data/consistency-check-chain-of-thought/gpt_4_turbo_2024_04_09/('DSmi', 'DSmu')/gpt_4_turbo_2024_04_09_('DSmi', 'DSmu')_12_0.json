            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm that the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf. Since there remains a possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy must be in the toy box. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is \"no.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" definitively rules out the possibility that the toy is necessarily on the bookshelf. This leaves only the other possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box. Thus, the answer to Question 2 is \"yes.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
