            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not definitively exclude the fridge as a location for the milk. Since this statement does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk must be on the counter. The possibility remains that the milk could still be in the fridge.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two exclusive options. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" definitively rules out the fridge as a location for the milk. Since the fridge is ruled out and the only other presented option is that the milk is on the counter, we can infer that the milk must indeed be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
