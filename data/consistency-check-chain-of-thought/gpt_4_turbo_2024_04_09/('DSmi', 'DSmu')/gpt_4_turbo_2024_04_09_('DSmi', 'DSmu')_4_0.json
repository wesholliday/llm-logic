            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not eliminate the possibility that they could still be there. Since there remains a possibility that the cookies are in the pantry, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The cookies are in the jar\" based solely on the information given.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry, leaving the only remaining possibility under the given conditions that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no, yes",
