            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This means that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not necessarily imply that it is impossible for the toy to be on the bookshelf. The toy could still possibly be on the bookshelf, but it's not a must. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" combined with \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is negated. Since the toy must not necessarily be on the bookshelf, and the only other option provided is that the toy is in the toy box, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" combined with \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not rule out the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Since the statement does not negate the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf entirely (it only states it might not be), we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box\" based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
