            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no certainty or necessity that the remote control is under the couch. This allows for the possibility that the remote control might be elsewhere. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" since this possibility is not ruled out.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not necessarily imply that it cannot be under the couch at all (i.e., it is not a must). Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because the use of \"might not\" introduces uncertainty about the remote's location, contradicting any necessity that it must be there.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we also know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the necessity of the remote being under the couch is negated, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Thus, we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch but does not eliminate it as a possibility (since \"might not\" is not definitive). Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be under the couch, as it still could be there.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
