            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden; it is not a requirement. This does not necessarily mean Fido is not in the garden, but it opens up the possibility that Fido might not be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" because the necessity of his being in the garden is negated, allowing for the possibility of his absence.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This statement does not assert Fido's absence as a fact but acknowledges it as a possibility. This implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. If Fido must be in the garden, then there would be no possibility of him not being there. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" then the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not negate the necessity of him being there as a must. Since the necessity (must) is not negated and only the possibility is acknowledged, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based solely on this possibility. Therefore, from these statements, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
