            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the second possibility. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out that it must be hiding there. It merely opens up the possibility that it might not be. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily imply \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which would require a definitive negation of the remote being under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively negate it. Since it does not confirm that the remote control is definitely not under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that it must be on the coffee table based solely on this possibility.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" definitively negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
