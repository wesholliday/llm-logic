            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two premises:\n- \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that there are only two possibilities: the book is either on the shelf or it must be on the table. The second premise negates the possibility that the book must be on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. Hence, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table. \"Might not\" implies uncertainty and does not definitively rule out the necessity of the book being on the table. Therefore, from \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we cannot definitively infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: We have the premises:\n- \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n- \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility that the book might not be on the table, but it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table. Since it does not rule out the necessity of the book being on the table, we cannot conclusively infer from these premises that the book is on the shelf. The possibility remains that the book could still be on the table.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" definitively states that the book is not necessarily on the table. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the book is not on the table. Therefore, from \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" we can infer \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
