            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements:\n- \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that since it is not true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the sunglasses to be perched on her head, just that it's not certain. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not a necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. Since the possibility (might not) does not contradict the lack of necessity (must not), we can infer that if the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, it is indeed not necessary that they must be perched on her head. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: We have two statements:\n- \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n- \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nThe second statement suggests a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it does not confirm it. Since it only introduces a possibility and does not negate the necessity that the sunglasses must be on her head, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on these statements. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, from the statement that it is not necessary (must not), we can infer that it might not be the case, which aligns with the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" Thus, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
