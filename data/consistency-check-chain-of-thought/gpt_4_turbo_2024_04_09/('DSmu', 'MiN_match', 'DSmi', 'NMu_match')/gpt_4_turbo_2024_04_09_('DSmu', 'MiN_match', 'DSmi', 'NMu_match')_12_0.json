            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the second possibility. Therefore, the only remaining valid option is that the toy is in the toy box. Thus, we can infer that the toy is indeed in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. It simply suggests uncertainty about the toy's location. Therefore, it does not necessarily mean \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which would categorically deny that the toy must be there.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf but does not completely negate the possibility that it must be there. Since there remains a possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box based solely on this information.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" definitively states that the toy does not necessarily have to be on the bookshelf. This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, which aligns with the statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" Therefore, from the statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
