            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement). The additional information provided is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which negates the second part of the disjunction. According to the rules of disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true to satisfy the statement. Therefore, since it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not exclude the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that it is not a certainty or requirement that Fido is in the garden. The possibility that Fido might not be in the garden does not necessarily mean that it is certain Fido isn't required to be there. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the latter from the former.\n\nQuestion 3: Here, we have the same initial statement as in Question 1, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" The additional information is \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" which suggests a possibility but does not confirm Fido's location. Since this statement does not definitively negate that Fido must be in the garden (it only introduces uncertainty), we cannot conclusively infer from these premises that Fido is inside. The possibility remains that Fido could still be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" indicates that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This implies that there is at least a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from the statement that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, we can infer that it might be the case that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
