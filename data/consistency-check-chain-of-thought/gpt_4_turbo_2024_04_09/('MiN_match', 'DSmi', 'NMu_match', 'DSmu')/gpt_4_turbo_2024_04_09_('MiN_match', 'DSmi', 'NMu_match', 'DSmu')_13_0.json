            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This implies uncertainty about the milk's chilling status. The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that it is not necessarily true that the milk is chilling in the fridge; there is a possibility that it might not be. Since the first statement introduces the possibility of the milk not chilling, it supports the idea that it is not necessarily chilling. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the milk chilling in the fridge but does not confirm it is not chilling. Since there is still a possibility that the milk could be chilling in the fridge (even though it might not be), we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based solely on these statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be chilling in the fridge; it could be elsewhere. This aligns with the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" which acknowledges the possibility of the milk not chilling. Thus, if it is not necessarily chilling, then it might not be chilling, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" we have two exclusive conditions. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the necessity of the milk chilling in the fridge, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
