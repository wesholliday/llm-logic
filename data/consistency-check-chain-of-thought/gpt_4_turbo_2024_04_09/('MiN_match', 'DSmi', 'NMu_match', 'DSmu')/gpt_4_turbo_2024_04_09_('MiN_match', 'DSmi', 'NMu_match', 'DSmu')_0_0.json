            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. \n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not necessary or certain that Fido is in the garden.\n- Since the possibility exists that Fido is not in the garden, it follows that it is not a certainty that he must be in the garden.\n- Therefore, from 'Fido might not be in the garden', we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' sets up a dichotomy where one of the two conditions must be true.\n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that he could still be in the garden.\n- Since the possibility that Fido is in the garden is not ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based solely on the possibility that he might not be in the garden.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Fido is inside' just because 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?\n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' indicates that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden.\n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests the possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- If it is not necessary that Fido is in the garden, then it is possible that he is not in the garden.\n- Therefore, from 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', we can infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nQuestion 4: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' again sets up a dichotomy.\n- 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden.\n- Since Fido must not necessarily be in the garden, and the only other option provided is that Fido is inside, we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\n- Therefore, from these premises, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
