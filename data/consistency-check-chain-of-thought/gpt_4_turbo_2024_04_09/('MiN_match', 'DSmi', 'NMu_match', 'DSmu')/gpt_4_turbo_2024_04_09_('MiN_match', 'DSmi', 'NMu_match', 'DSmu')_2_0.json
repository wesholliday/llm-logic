            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This contrasts with the statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet but does not deny the possibility. Thus, if it is stated that the keys might not be dangling, it logically follows that it is not necessarily the case that they must be dangling. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not eliminate it entirely, as it only suggests a possibility of the keys not dangling. Since the possibility of the keys dangling is not completely ruled out, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys must be in the drawer. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet. This aligns with the statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" which suggests a possibility of the keys not being in the cabinet. Since the absence of necessity (from the first statement) supports the possibility of non-presence (from the second statement), the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet,\" and the additional information \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" we understand that the necessity of the keys dangling in the cabinet is negated. This leaves only the other part of the disjunction as true, which is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
