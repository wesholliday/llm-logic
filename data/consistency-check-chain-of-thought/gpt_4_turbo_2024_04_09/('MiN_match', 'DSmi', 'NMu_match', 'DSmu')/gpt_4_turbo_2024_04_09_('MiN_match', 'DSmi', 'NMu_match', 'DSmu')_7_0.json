            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is definitely under the couch. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, it supports the idea that the remote control being under the couch is not a necessity. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" this implies there is a possibility that it is not under the couch, but it does not confirm its absence from there. Since the possibility of the remote control not being under the couch does not eliminate it being under the couch as a necessity, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" directly implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch. This aligns with the idea that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" which acknowledges the possibility of the remote control not being under the couch. Thus, we can infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch,\" if we know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" this negates the necessity of the remote control being under the couch. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility presented in the original statement, which is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
