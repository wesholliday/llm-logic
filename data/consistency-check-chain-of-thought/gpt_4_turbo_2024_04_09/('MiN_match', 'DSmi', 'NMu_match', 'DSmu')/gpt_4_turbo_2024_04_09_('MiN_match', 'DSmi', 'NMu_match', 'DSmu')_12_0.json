            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not necessarily true that the toy is on the bookshelf. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, it aligns with the second statement that it is not necessarily on the bookshelf. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm it. Since the possibility exists that the toy might still be on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box based solely on these statements. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This directly supports the idea that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" as it acknowledges the possibility of the toy not being on the bookshelf. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf, leaving the only remaining possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
