            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. It simply states that it's not certain. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" because the necessity of Fido being in the garden isn't addressed directly.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm it as a fact. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer from these statements that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
