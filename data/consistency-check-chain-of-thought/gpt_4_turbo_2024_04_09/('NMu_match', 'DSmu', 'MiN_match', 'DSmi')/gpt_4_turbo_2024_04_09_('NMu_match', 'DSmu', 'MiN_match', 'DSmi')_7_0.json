            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch; it might be somewhere else. This logically allows for the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the necessity of the remote being under the couch is negated, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, we can infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it must be under the couch. This statement does not necessarily negate the necessity (must) of the remote being under the couch; it only introduces uncertainty. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" combined with \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" again introduces a possibility that the remote is not under the couch but does not confirm it. Since the necessity of the remote being under the couch is not definitively negated (only doubted), we cannot conclusively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
