            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" negates the second possibility. Since either one or the other must be true, and it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, it logically follows that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. \"Might not be\" indicates uncertainty and does not definitively rule out the necessity of the jacket hanging in the closet. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" based solely on the statement that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not confirm it. Since this does not definitively negate the possibility that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, we cannot conclusively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
