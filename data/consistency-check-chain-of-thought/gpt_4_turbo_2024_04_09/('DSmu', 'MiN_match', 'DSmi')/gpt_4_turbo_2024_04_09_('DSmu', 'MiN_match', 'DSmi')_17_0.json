            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" negates the second possibility. Since the second option is negated, the only remaining valid option from the original statement is that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. The statement \"might not be\" indicates uncertainty but does not rule out the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" based solely on the statement that \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" introduces a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not confirm it. Since this does not definitively negate the possibility that the notebook must be on the nightstand, we cannot conclude with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer. The possibility remains that the notebook could still be on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
