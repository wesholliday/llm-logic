            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it does not definitively rule out that they must be hidden there. The phrase \"might not be\" indicates uncertainty and does not equate to a definitive negation required by \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" Therefore, we cannot infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" introduces a possibility that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry, but it does not confirm that they are not in the pantry. Since this does not definitively eliminate the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, we cannot conclusively infer that the cookies are in the jar based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
