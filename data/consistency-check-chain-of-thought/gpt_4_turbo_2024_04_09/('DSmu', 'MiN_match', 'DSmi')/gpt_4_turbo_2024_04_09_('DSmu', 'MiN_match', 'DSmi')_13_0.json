Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility as true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, as \"might not\" suggests uncertainty rather than certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not definitively negate it. Since there remains a possibility that the milk could still be chilling in the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
