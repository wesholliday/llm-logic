            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not definitively rule out that they must be dangling in the cabinet. The modal verb \"might\" indicates uncertainty but does not negate the necessity (must) that the keys are in the cabinet. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces uncertainty about the keys being in the cabinet but does not definitively eliminate the possibility that they must be there. Since the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet is not negated, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys are in the drawer based solely on the possibility that they might not be in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
