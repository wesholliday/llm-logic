Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the second possibility. If the second possibility is negated, then the first must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it must be hiding there. The phrase \"might not be\" indicates uncertainty but does not definitively negate the necessity of the remote being under the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not confirm it. Since this does not definitively negate the possibility of the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
