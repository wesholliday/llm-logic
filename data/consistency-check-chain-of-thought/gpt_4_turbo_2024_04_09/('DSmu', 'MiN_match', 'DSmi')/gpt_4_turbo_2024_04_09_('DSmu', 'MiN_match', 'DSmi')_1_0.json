            "content": "For Question 1, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" negates the second possibility, leaving only the first possibility that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nFor Question 2, the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not necessarily negate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table. The modal verb \"might\" indicates uncertainty and does not rule out the necessity of the book being on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" solely based on the statement that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nFor Question 3, the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm it. Since it does not definitively negate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table, we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
