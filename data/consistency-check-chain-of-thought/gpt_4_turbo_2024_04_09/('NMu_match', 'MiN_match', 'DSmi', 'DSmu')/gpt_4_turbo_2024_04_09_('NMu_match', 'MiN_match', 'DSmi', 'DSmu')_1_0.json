            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that there is no necessity for the book to be on the table; it is not required or mandatory. This logically allows for the possibility that the book might not be resting on the table. Therefore, from the statement given, we can infer that \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily negate the possibility that the book must be on the table in some contexts or under certain conditions. Thus, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively conclude that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" as the necessity (must) and possibility (might) are addressing different modal scopes.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" combined with \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that while there is a possibility the book is not on the table, it does not eliminate the necessity that it could be on the table in some interpretations. Since the necessity isn't completely ruled out by the possibility, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" combined with \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" directly negates the necessity of the book being on the table. This leaves us with the only remaining option in the disjunction that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
