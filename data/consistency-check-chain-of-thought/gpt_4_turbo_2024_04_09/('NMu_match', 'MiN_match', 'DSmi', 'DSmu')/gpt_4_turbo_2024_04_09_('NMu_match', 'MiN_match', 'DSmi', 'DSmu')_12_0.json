            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it opens up the possibility that the toy might not be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This statement implies uncertainty about the toy's location, which means it is not necessarily required to be on the bookshelf. Thus, from this statement, we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf but does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since there remains a possibility that the toy could be on the bookshelf despite the uncertainty, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box\" based solely on these statements.\n\nQuestion 4: Again, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf, leaving the only remaining necessary option that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\" based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, yes",
