            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden; it does not have to be true that Fido is in the garden. This logically allows for the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden. Therefore, from the statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily imply that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden (i.e., it doesn't rule out that Fido must be in the garden under certain conditions or assumptions). Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot directly infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" combined with \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that while it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, there is still a necessity condition attached to him being in the garden. Since \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden (it only states a possibility of him not being there), we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside\" just based on these statements. The possibility remains that Fido could still be in the garden.\n\nQuestion 4: From the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" combined with \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer that Fido is inside. The second statement negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, leaving the only remaining option from the first statement that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
