            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch; it might be somewhere else. This directly leads to the possibility that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" since it is not necessarily there. Thus, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. However, this does not rule out the possibility that it must be under the couch in some contexts or under certain conditions. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively conclude \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" as the necessity might still exist in some scenarios. Thus, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch but does not eliminate the possibility entirely. Since there remains a possibility (even if not a certainty) that the remote could still be under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" based solely on the provided statements. Thus, the inference is not valid.\n\nQuestion 4: Again, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, leaving the only remaining possibility from the original statement that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" Thus, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no, yes",
