            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not confirm that the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf. Since there is still a possibility that the toy could be on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" definitively rules out the possibility that the toy must be on the bookshelf. This leaves only the other possibility that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. Therefore, it does not necessarily imply \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" which would require a definitive exclusion of the toy being on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" indicates that it is not a certainty that the toy is on the bookshelf. This implies that there is at least a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
