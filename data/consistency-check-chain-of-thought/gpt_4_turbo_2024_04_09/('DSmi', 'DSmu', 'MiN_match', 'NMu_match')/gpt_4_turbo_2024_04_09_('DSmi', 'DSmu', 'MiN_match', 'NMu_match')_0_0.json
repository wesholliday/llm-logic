            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Since it's not definitively stated that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" definitively rules out the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. This leaves only the other possibility that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\" The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies uncertainty about Fido's presence in the garden; it suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not rule out that Fido could still be in the garden. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" definitively states that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. Since \"might not be\" does not equate to a definitive negation of \"must be,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" solely from \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" clearly indicates that Fido being in the garden is not a necessity. This logically implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, which aligns with the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" Therefore, from \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can infer \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
