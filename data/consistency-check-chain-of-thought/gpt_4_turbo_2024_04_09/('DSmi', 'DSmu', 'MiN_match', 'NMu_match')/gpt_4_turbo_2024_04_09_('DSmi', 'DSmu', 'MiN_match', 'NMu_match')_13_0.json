            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it definitively. Since the first statement is a definite either/or and the second statement only suggests a possibility without confirming the absence of the milk from the fridge, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The milk is on the counter.\" The possibility remains that the milk could still be in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, the initial statement is \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\" The second statement here is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which definitively negates the necessity of the milk being in the fridge. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the either/or statement, which is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies uncertainty about the location of the milk\u2014it might or might not be in the fridge. However, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be in the fridge, but it does not exclude the possibility that it could still be there. The first statement does not necessarily lead to the second because the possibility (might not) does not negate the necessity (must be).\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means that there is no requirement for the milk to be in the fridge, which directly implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
