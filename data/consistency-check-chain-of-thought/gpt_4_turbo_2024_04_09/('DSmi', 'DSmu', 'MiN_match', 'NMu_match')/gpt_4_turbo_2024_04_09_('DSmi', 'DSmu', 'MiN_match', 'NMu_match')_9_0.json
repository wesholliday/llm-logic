            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed, but it does not confirm this as a fact. Since it's not definitively stated that the sock isn't under the bed, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\" It remains a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nQuestion 2: Here, the statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" again presents two exclusive options. The phrase \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" definitively rules out the bed as the location of the sock. Since the sock must be in one of the two locations mentioned and it's confirmed not to be under the bed, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" implies uncertainty about the location of the sock under the bed\u2014it might or might not be there. However, \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" implies a definite negation of the necessity of the sock being under the bed. The first statement does not necessarily lead to the second because suggesting a possibility (might not) does not equate to confirming that it definitely isn't the case (must not).\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" indicates that there is no necessity for the sock to be under the bed. This logically implies that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed, aligning with the statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\" Therefore, we can infer that from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
