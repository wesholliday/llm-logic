            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests a disjunction where one of the two conditions must be true. The additional statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" introduces a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not confirm that they definitely aren't there. Since this possibility does not eliminate the chance that the keys could still be in the cabinet, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The keys are in the drawer.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 2: Again, the initial statement is \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" The additional statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" definitively rules out the possibility that the keys are necessarily in the cabinet. This leaves the only remaining option from the disjunction that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\" The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not assert this as a certainty. On the other hand, \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that it is not a necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet, which is a stronger statement. Since the possibility does not imply the negation of necessity, we cannot infer the stronger statement from the weaker one. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" indicates that it is not necessary for the keys to be in the cabinet. This logically implies that there is at least a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, which aligns with the statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" from \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" The answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, no, yes",
