            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that it could be there. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that it is not necessarily true that the remote control is under the couch; it could be elsewhere. Thus, from the possibility that the remote control might not be under the couch, we can infer that it is not necessarily under the couch. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no certainty or requirement that the remote control is under the couch. This aligns with the statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" which acknowledges the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. Therefore, from knowing that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch, we can infer that it might not be under the couch. Hence, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we also know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" then the necessity of the remote being under the couch is negated, leaving the only remaining possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. Thus, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there is a possibility that the remote is not under the couch, but it does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there. Since this statement does not definitively rule out the remote being under the couch, we cannot conclusively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on this possibility. Therefore, the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
