            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: From 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'?\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This means that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden.\n- The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that it is not a certainty or requirement that Fido is in the garden.\n- Since 'Fido might not be in the garden' introduces the possibility of Fido not being in the garden, it logically supports the idea that Fido's presence in the garden is not a must. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' from 'Fido might not be in the garden'.\n\nQuestion 2: From 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido might not be in the garden'?\n- The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' indicates that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden, but it does not necessarily imply that Fido is not in the garden or that there is a possibility of him not being there.\n- 'Fido might not be in the garden' specifically suggests the possibility of Fido not being in the garden.\n- Since the absence of necessity does not automatically imply possibility (Fido could still be in the garden by choice or coincidence), we cannot directly infer 'Fido might not be in the garden' from 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nQuestion 3: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' sets up a dichotomy where only one of the two conditions can be true.\n- Adding 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' negates the second condition of the dichotomy.\n- Since the second condition (Fido must be in the garden) is negated, the only remaining valid condition under the dichotomy is that 'Fido is inside'. Therefore, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nQuestion 4: From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n- The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' again presents a dichotomy.\n- The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not negate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden.\n- Since 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not definitively negate the possibility of Fido being in the garden, we cannot conclusively infer that 'Fido is inside' based solely on this possibility. There remains a chance that Fido could be in the garden.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, no",
