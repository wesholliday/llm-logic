            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that they could be there. The inference \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not a certainty that the keys are in the cabinet. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, it supports the inference that it is not certain (or a must) that the keys are in the cabinet. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is no necessity for the keys to be in the cabinet; they could be elsewhere. This does not directly imply that \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet,\" which suggests a possibility of the keys not being there. However, if it is not a necessity that the keys are in the cabinet, it logically follows that there is a possibility they might not be there. Thus, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet. Since one of the conditions (keys must be in the cabinet) is negated, the only remaining valid condition under the original statement is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, the inference that \"The keys are in the drawer\" is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests a possibility but does not negate the possibility that the keys could still be in the cabinet. Since this does not definitively eliminate the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\" based solely on the possibility that they might not be in the cabinet. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes, no",
