            "content": "Question 1 Analysis:\nThe statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates the second possibility. Since either one or the other must be true, and the second option is negated, it logically follows that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nQuestion 2 Analysis:\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. This does not rule out the possibility that they could still be on her head, but it is not a requirement. Therefore, it can be inferred that \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" since this statement allows for the possibility that they are not on her head.\n\nQuestion 3 Analysis:\nThe statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, this does not strictly imply that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" because the original statement only indicates a possibility, not a necessity. The necessity (must) would be negated if it were certain that the sunglasses are not on her head, but \"might not\" only indicates uncertainty, not certainty.\n\nQuestion 4 Analysis:\nThe statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities. The additional statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" introduces uncertainty about the second possibility but does not negate it entirely. Since there is still a chance, however small, that the sunglasses could be on her head (as \"might not\" is not definitive), we cannot conclusively infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
