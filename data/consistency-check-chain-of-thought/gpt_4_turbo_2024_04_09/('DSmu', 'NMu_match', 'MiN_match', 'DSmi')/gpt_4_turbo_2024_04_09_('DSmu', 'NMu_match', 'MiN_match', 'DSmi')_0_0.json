            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The first statement is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). The second statement negates one of the disjuncts, specifically that \"Fido must be in the garden.\" According to the rules of disjunction, if one disjunct is false, the other must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, since it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, Fido must be inside.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that there is no necessity for Fido to be in the garden. This does not necessarily mean Fido is not in the garden, but it opens up the possibility that Fido might not be there. Thus, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" indicates a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not strictly negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden; it merely suggests that it's not certain. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we cannot definitively conclude \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" as the latter requires a definite negation of necessity, not just a possibility.\n\nQuestion 4: We have the statements \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" The second statement suggests a possibility that Fido is not in the garden but does not confirm it. Since it does not confirm Fido's absence from the garden, we cannot use it to definitively conclude that Fido must be inside. The possibility that Fido might not be in the garden does not eliminate the chance that he could still be there, thus we cannot infer that Fido is inside based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
