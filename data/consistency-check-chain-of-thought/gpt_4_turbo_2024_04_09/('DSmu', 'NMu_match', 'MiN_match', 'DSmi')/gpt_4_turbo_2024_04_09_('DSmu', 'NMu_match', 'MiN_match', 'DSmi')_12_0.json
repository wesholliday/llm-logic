            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. The additional information \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" negates the second possibility. Since the second possibility is negated, the only remaining valid option from the original statement is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf, but it opens up the possibility that the toy might not be there. Thus, from this statement, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not strictly negate the possibility that the toy must be on the bookshelf in some contexts or interpretations. The statement allows for uncertainty but does not confirm the absence of necessity. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot definitively infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" again presents two possibilities. The additional information \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" introduces a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf but does not confirm it. Since there is still a possibility that the toy could be on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box based solely on this information. Therefore, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box from these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no, no",
