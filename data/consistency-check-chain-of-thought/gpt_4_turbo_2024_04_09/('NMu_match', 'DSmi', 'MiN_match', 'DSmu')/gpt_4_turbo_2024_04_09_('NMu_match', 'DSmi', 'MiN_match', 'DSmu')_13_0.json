            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the milk is in the fridge. This means that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" this suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the milk could still be in the fridge (since \"might not\" implies possibility, not certainty). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The milk is on the counter\" just because it might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. This directly supports the idea that it is not necessarily true that the milk must be in the fridge. Thus, from \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" if we know \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" this eliminates the possibility that the milk must be in the fridge. Since this possibility is ruled out, the only remaining possibility under the given disjunction is that \"The milk is on the counter.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
