            "content": "Question 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is no necessity for the remote control to be under the couch; it does not have to be there. This allows for the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" this suggests that the necessity of the remote being under the couch is not certain. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be under the couch, as \"might not be\" does not equate to \"is not.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" just based on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This directly supports the idea that it is not necessarily under the couch. Thus, from \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch,\" if we know \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" this negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch. This leaves the only remaining possibility presented in the original statement, which is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
