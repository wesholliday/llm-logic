            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it opens up the possibility that the toy might not be there. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" this implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf, as \"might not\" does not equate to \"is not.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The toy is in the toy box\" just because it might not be on the bookshelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. This directly implies that it is not necessarily true that the toy must be on the bookshelf. Hence, from this statement, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" if we know \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" this negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf. Since one of the two conditions must be true and the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf is negated, the only remaining possibility under these conditions is that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
