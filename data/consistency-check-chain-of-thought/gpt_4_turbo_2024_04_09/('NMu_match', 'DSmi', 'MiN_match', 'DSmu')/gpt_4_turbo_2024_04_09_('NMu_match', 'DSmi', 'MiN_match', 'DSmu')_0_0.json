            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" implies that it is not necessarily true that Fido is in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities. If we also know that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" it suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden, as \"might not\" does not mean \"definitely not.\" Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Fido is inside\" just based on these statements.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This directly supports the idea that it is not necessarily true that Fido must be in the garden. Thus, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" if we know \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" then the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the original statement, which is that \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
