            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the book is on the table; it could be elsewhere. This logically leads to the possibility that \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" since the necessity of the book being on the table is negated. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities. If we also know \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" this suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that the book could still be on the table (since \"might not\" implies possibility, not certainty). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The book is on the shelf\" just because it might not be on the table. The book could still be on the table or on the shelf.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This directly supports the idea that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" because if there was a necessity for the book to be on the table, it could not possibly be elsewhere. Thus, the inference is valid.\n\nQuestion 4: Given the statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" if we know \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" this negates the necessity of the book being on the table. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility presented in the original statement, which is that \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes, yes",
