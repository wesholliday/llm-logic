Then when you are ready to answer all the questions, please write 'Answer: ' followed by 3 answers separated by commas.

            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- The first statement gives us two possibilities: the remote control is either on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n- The second statement eliminates the possibility that it must be hiding under the couch.\n- Since one of the two possibilities is eliminated, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nQuestion 2: \n- The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that it's not a necessity for the remote control to be hiding under the couch.\n- This directly aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\", as both indicate the lack of necessity for the remote control to be under the couch.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" from the given statement.\n\nQuestion 3: \n- The first statement gives us two possibilities: the remote control is either on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n- The second statement suggests that it's not necessary for the remote control to be hiding under the couch, but it doesn't eliminate the possibility entirely; it merely indicates that there are other possibilities.\n- Since the second statement doesn't conclusively eliminate the possibility of the remote control being under the couch (it only suggests it might not be), we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
