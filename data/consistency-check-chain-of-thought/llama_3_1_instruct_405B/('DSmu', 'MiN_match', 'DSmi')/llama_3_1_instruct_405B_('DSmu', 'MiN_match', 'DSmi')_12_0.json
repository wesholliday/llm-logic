            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- The first statement gives us two possibilities: the toy is either in the toy box or it must be on the bookshelf. \n- The second statement eliminates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf but doesn't eliminate the possibility of it being there.\n- Since the toy doesn't have to be on the bookshelf, but the first statement requires it to be in one of the two locations, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box because the necessity of it being on the bookshelf is negated.\n\nQuestion 2: \n- The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' implies there's a possibility it's not on the bookshelf, but it also leaves open the possibility that it could be.\n- 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' directly negates the necessity of the toy being on the bookshelf, which aligns with the implication that there's a possibility it's not on the bookshelf.\n- Therefore, from 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf', we can infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\nQuestion 3: \n- The first statement gives us two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box or it must be on the bookshelf.\n- The second statement suggests there's a possibility the toy is not on the bookshelf, but unlike Question 1, it doesn't eliminate the necessity directly; it merely introduces doubt.\n- Since the doubt about the toy being on the bookshelf doesn't negate the necessity directly as in Question 1, we cannot confidently infer the toy is in the toy box based on the combination of these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
