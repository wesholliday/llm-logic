            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- The first statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This is a disjunction (an 'or' statement) indicating that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n- The second statement is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This negates the second option of the disjunction.\n- Since one of the disjuncts is negated, we can infer the other disjunct must be true, which is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 2:\n- The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies there's a possibility Fido is not in the garden.\n- This directly contradicts the necessity implied by \"Fido must be in the garden.\"\n- Therefore, if Fido might not be in the garden, it's true that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Combining the insights from the first two questions, if we know \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and also that \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer from the second statement that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" (as per Question 2's reasoning).\n- Given this negation, we can then infer \"Fido is inside\" (as per Question 1's reasoning).\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
