            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" implies two possibilities: the sunglasses are either in her bag or they are necessarily on her head.\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" eliminates the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head.\n- Since one of the two possibilities is eliminated, we are left with the other possibility as a certainty, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nQuestion 2:\n- The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n- The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" indicates that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head, aligning with the possibility suggested in the first statement.\n- Since \"might not\" directly counters \"must,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" from \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nQuestion 3:\n- The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" again presents two possibilities.\n- The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" does not eliminate the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head entirely; it merely suggests that it's not a necessity.\n- Since the second statement does not conclusively eliminate one of the possibilities presented in the first statement, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
