            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there are only two possibilities: the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\", eliminates the second possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This statement does not rule out the possibility that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, it only suggests that there is some doubt or uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" from this statement alone.\n\nQuestion 3: This question combines the same statement from Question 1 with the statement from Question 2. As we established in Question 2, \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" does not provide sufficient information to conclude \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\". Without this conclusion, we cannot infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" as we did in Question 1.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
