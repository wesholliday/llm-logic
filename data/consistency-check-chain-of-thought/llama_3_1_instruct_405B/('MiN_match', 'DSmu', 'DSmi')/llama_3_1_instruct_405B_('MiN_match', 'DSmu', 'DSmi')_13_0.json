            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This directly supports the conclusion that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" because if there's even a possibility that the milk is not chilling, then it cannot be a necessity (must) that it is chilling. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" from the given statement.\n\n2. Given \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and knowing \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" we can logically conclude that since the necessity of the milk chilling in the fridge is negated, the only remaining option from the given disjunction is that \"The milk is on the counter.\" This is because in a disjunction (either/or statement), if one option is proven false, the other must be true.\n\n3. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" does not definitively tell us that the milk is not chilling; it merely suggests a possibility. Therefore, when combined with \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" we cannot conclusively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" because the possibility (might) does not negate the necessity (must) outright. The milk could still be chilling in the fridge even if there's a possibility it's not, which doesn't force the conclusion that it's on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
