            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This directly aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" because if the book might not be on the table, it certainly doesn't have to be on the table. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" from \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n\n2. The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities: the book is either on the shelf, or it is a necessity that the book is on the table. When combined with \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" which negates the necessity of the book being on the table, we are left with the only other option provided by the first statement: \"The book is on the shelf.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The book is on the shelf\" from these two statements together.\n\n3. Given \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" we cannot directly infer \"The book is on the shelf.\" The reason is that \"The book might not be resting on the table\" does not exclude the possibility that the book is on the table; it merely states that it's not a necessity. Therefore, the book could still be on the table even if it doesn't have to be, which means we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
