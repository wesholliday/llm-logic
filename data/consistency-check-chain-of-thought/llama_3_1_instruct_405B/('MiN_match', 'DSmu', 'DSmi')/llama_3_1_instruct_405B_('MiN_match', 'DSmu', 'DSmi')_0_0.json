            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This directly counters the idea that Fido must be in the garden, because if Fido must be in the garden, then there would be no possibility of him not being there. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n2. Given \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and knowing \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can logically conclude that since one of the options (Fido must be in the garden) is not true, the other option (Fido is inside) must be true. This is a straightforward application of the principle of disjunction elimination in logic.\n\n3. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not directly tell us that Fido is not in the garden; it only indicates a possibility. However, when combined with \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" and considering our analysis in question 1 that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" leads to \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can then follow the same reasoning as in question 2. This means we can infer \"Fido is inside\" because the possibility that Fido might not be in the garden is enough to negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden, thus triggering the disjunction elimination similar to question 2.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
