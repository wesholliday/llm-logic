            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. This directly negates the necessity that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n\n2. Given \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet,\" if we know \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" we can conclude that since the jacket doesn't have to be in the closet, the other option must be true. Thus, we can infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\n3. Knowing \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" doesn't necessarily mean it's not in the closet; it just means there's a possibility it's not. This doesn't directly negate the condition in \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" because \"might not\" doesn't exclude \"must\" entirely since \"must\" implies certainty, and \"might not\" allows for uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" with certainty from these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
