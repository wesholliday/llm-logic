            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This directly aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" because if there's a possibility it's not under the couch, then it cannot be a necessity (must) for it to be under the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" from the given statement.\n\nQuestion 2: Given \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and knowing \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" we can logically conclude that since the necessity (must) of it being under the couch is negated, the only remaining option from the given either/or statement is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\" This is because in an either/or scenario, if one option is proven false, the other must be true.\n\nQuestion 3: This question combines \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" with \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" The second statement here only suggests a possibility and does not negate the necessity directly as in Question 2. Saying \"might not\" leaves open both possibilities (it could be under the couch or not), which doesn't directly negate the \"must\" condition in the either/or statement. Therefore, we cannot confidently infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" from these statements because the possibility (might) does not provide a strong enough logical basis to eliminate the \"must\" condition entirely.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, no",
