            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" implies that if the remote control is not on the coffee table, then it must be hiding under the couch. However, the additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces uncertainty about the remote control's location under the couch. It does not provide enough information to conclude that the remote control is definitely on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is \"no\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" directly contradicts the idea that the remote control \"must\" be hiding under the couch. If it might not be there, then it's not a necessity (must) for it to be there. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\". The answer to Question 2 is \"yes\".\n\nQuestion 3: Given the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and knowing from Question 2 that we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\", we can deduce that since the \"must\" condition is negated, the only remaining option from the original either/or statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, the answer to Question 3 is \"yes\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
