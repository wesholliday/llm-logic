            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" implies that there are only two possibilities: the book is either on the shelf or it has to be on the table. However, \"The book might not be resting on the table\" introduces uncertainty about the book's presence on the table but does not confirm its absence. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" because the book might still be on the table or it might not be on either the shelf or the table. The presence of \"might\" introduces a level of uncertainty that prevents a definitive conclusion.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" directly challenges the necessity of the book being on the table. If the book might not be on the table, then it cannot be a must for the book to be on the table. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" because \"might not\" contradicts the necessity implied by \"must.\"\n\nQuestion 3: Given \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and knowing \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" we can infer that the condition for the book to be on the table (it must be resting on the table) is not met. Since one of the two options is negated (the necessity of being on the table), the other option (the book is on the shelf) becomes the only viable choice within the context of this binary scenario.\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
