            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" implies that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden. However, \"Fido might not be in the garden\" introduces uncertainty about Fido's location in the garden, but it does not confirm that he is not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based on these two statements.\n\n2. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" directly implies uncertainty about the necessity of Fido being in the garden. If there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be a must for him to be there. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" from \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\n3. Given \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and knowing \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\", we can infer that since the option of Fido \"must be in the garden\" is negated, the only remaining possibility from the original statement is that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
