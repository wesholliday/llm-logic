            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" implies that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table. However, the statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. It does not rule out the possibility that the book is resting on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is the same as before. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" directly negates the \"must\" condition. This means that the book is not necessarily resting on the table, which leaves the only other option: the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" suggests a possibility, not a certainty. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" directly negates the \"must\" condition, which is a stronger claim. The \"might not\" statement does imply that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, because if it must be, then there would be no possibility of it not being on the table. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
