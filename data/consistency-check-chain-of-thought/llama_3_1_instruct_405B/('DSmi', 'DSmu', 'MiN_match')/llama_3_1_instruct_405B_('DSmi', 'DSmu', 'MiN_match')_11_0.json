            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" implies that if the jacket is not draped over the chair, then it must be hanging in the closet. However, the statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. It does not rule out the possibility that the jacket is indeed hanging in the closet. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" is a disjunction, where one of the options is a necessity (must be hanging in the closet). The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" negates this necessity, which means that the jacket being draped over the chair becomes the only remaining option. Therefore, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\".\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This is equivalent to saying that it's not necessary (or must be the case) that the jacket is hanging in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
