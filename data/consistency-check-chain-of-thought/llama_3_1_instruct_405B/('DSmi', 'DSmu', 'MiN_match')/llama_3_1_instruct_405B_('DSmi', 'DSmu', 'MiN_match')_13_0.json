            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that if the milk is not on the counter, then it must be chilling in the fridge. However, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. It does not rule out the possibility that the milk is indeed chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The milk is on the counter\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" directly negates the \"must be chilling in the fridge\" part of the first statement. Given the initial either-or statement, if it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, the only remaining option is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer \"The milk is on the counter\".\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies there's a possibility that it's not chilling in the fridge. This directly supports the idea that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\", because if there's even a possibility it's not chilling, then it cannot be a must. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
