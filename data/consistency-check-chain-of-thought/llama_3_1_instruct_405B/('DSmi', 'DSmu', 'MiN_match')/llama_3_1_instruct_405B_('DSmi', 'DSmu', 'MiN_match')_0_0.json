            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" implies that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden. However, the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. It does not rule out the possibility that Fido is indeed in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" implies that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" directly negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Given that one of the two options must be true, and it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This directly implies that it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden, because if he must be in the garden, then there would be no possibility of him not being there. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
