            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that if the keys are not in the drawer, then they must be dangling in the cabinet. However, the statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. It does not rule out the possibility that the keys are indeed dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" directly negates the second option of the initial statement. This means that the condition for the keys not being in the drawer (i.e., they must be dangling in the cabinet) is not met. Given the initial statement's structure, if the keys don't have to be in the cabinet, the only remaining option is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" suggests there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. This implies it's not a necessity for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, from \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\", we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\".\n\nAnswer: no, yes, yes",
