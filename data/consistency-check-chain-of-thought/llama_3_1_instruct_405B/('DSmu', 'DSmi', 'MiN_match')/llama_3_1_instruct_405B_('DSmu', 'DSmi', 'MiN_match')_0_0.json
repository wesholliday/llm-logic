            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: \n- The first statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This is a disjunction (an 'or' statement) that presents two possibilities: Fido being inside or it being necessary that Fido is in the garden.\n- The second statement is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden but does not negate the possibility of Fido being in the garden.\n- Since the necessity of Fido being in the garden is negated, we are left with the first option of the disjunction as the only necessity: Fido is inside.\n- Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nQuestion 2:\n- The first statement remains the same as in Question 1.\n- The second statement is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This introduces a possibility rather than a necessity, suggesting that it is not certain whether Fido is in the garden or not.\n- This possibility does not negate the necessity presented in the first statement; it merely suggests uncertainty about one of the options.\n- Since the second statement does not definitively negate the necessity of Fido being in the garden (it only suggests a possibility), we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" with certainty based on the given statements.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n- If Fido might not be in the garden, then it cannot be necessary that Fido is in the garden, because necessity implies no alternative possibilities.\n- Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
