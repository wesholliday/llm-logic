            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have two statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\". The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), and the second statement negates one of the disjuncts. When we negate one disjunct, we can infer the other disjunct. Therefore, we can infer \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nQuestion 2: We have two statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\". The second statement does not negate the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head; it only suggests that it's not a necessity. This does not provide enough information to infer \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nQuestion 3: We have one statement: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\". This statement implies that it's not a necessity for the sunglasses to be perched on her head. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\".\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
