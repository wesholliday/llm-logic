            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there are only two possibilities: the jacket is draped over the chair, or it is obligatory that it hangs in the closet. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" negates the obligation of the jacket hanging in the closet, which directly leads to the conclusion that the jacket is draped over the chair, as the first statement presents these as the only two options.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" is combined with \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" The second statement introduces uncertainty about the jacket's location, suggesting it's possible it's not in the closet, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could still be in the closet. This doesn't provide enough information to definitively conclude the jacket is draped over the chair, as the jacket not necessarily being in the closet doesn't negate the possibility it could still be there.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests there is a possibility the jacket is not in the closet. This directly contradicts the notion that it must be hanging in the closet, as \"must\" implies no alternative. Therefore, if there's a possibility the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it cannot be the case that it must be hanging in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
