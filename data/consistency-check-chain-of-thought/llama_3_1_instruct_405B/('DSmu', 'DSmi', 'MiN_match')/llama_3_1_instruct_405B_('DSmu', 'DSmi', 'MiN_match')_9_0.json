            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" implies that there are only two possibilities for the missing sock's location. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\", eliminates the option that the sock must be under the bed. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" is the same as in Question 1. However, the second statement, \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\", only suggests a possibility, rather than eliminating the option entirely. Therefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" implies that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed. This is equivalent to saying that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\".\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
