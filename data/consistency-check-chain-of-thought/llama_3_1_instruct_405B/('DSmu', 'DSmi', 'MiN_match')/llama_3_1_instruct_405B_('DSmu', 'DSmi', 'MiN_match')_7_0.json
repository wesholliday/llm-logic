            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: We have a statement that says the remote control is either on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. Then, we are given that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This directly negates one of the two options given in the first statement, leaving us with the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table. This is a straightforward application of disjunctive syllogism, where if we have \"A or B\" and \"not B\", we can conclude \"A\".\n\nQuestion 2: Here, we're told the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, which doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table. The word \"might\" suggests a possibility rather than a certainty, so it doesn't rule out the option of the remote control being under the couch entirely. It merely introduces doubt, which isn't enough to make a definitive conclusion about the remote control's location.\n\nQuestion 3: This question asks if we can infer that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch from the statement that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. The key here is understanding the difference between \"might not\" and \"must not\". \"Might not\" suggests a possibility of not being under the couch, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of it being under the couch entirely. Therefore, we cannot infer a \"must not\" condition from a \"might not\" condition. They speak to different levels of certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, no",
