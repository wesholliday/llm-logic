            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This directly counters the idea that Fido must be in the garden, because if Fido must be in the garden, then there would be no possibility of him not being there. Therefore, from \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n2. The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities: Fido is inside, or it is necessary that Fido is in the garden. When combined with \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" which as we've established implies \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" we can see that the necessity of Fido being in the garden is ruled out. This leaves us with the only other option from the original statement, which is \"Fido is inside.\" Therefore, we can infer \"Fido is inside\" from these two statements together.\n\n3. Given the analysis in question 1, we know that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" Therefore, the reasoning for question 3 essentially mirrors that of question 2. Since \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and we've established that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" the only remaining option is that \"Fido is inside.\" Thus, we can infer \"Fido is inside\" from these two statements together as well.\n\nAnswer: yes, yes, yes",
