            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This directly negates the necessity that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" from the given statement.\n\n2. The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two possibilities: the milk is either on the counter, or it is necessarily chilling in the fridge. When combined with \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\", we understand that the necessity of the milk chilling in the fridge is not guaranteed. However, this does not directly imply that the milk is on the counter because \"might not\" introduces uncertainty rather than a definitive conclusion. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The milk is on the counter\" from these statements.\n\n3. Given \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\", the latter statement directly negates the second option of the former statement. In a situation where one of two options must be true and one option is eliminated, the remaining option must be true. Therefore, we can infer \"The milk is on the counter\" from these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
