            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This directly negates the necessity that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nQuestion 2: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities, but the use of \"must\" in the second option implies a necessity for the remote control to be under the couch if it's not on the coffee table. The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" introduces doubt about the necessity of the remote control being under the couch but does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that the remote control is on the coffee table. It merely suggests that there's a possibility it's not under the couch, not that it cannot be under the couch.\n\nQuestion 3: This question combines \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" with \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" Since we've established that the remote control doesn't necessarily have to be under the couch, and given the binary choice presented, if it's not necessarily under the couch, the only other option provided is that it is on the coffee table. This question, unlike Question 2, does not deal with possibilities but with the negation of a necessity, which allows us to infer the other option as a fact.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
