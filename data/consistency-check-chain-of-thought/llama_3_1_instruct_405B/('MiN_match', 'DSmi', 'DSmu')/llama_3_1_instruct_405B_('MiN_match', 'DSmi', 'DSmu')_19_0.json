            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\nQuestion 1: The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This directly negates the necessity that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\".\n\nQuestion 2: From \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\", if the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head (as suggested by \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\"), it does not directly imply that the sunglasses are in her bag because \"might not\" introduces uncertainty, not a definitive conclusion about their location.\n\nQuestion 3: Given \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and knowing \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\", we can deduce that since the necessity of the sunglasses being perched on her head is negated, the only remaining option from the original statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
