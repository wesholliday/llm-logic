            "content": "Let's analyze each question step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. This directly aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry,\" because if the cookies might not be hidden, then it cannot be a necessity (must) for them to be hidden there. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" from the given statement.\n\n2. The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" presents two possibilities: the cookies are either in the jar, or it is necessary that they are hidden in the pantry. When combined with \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" we understand that the necessity of the cookies being hidden in the pantry is not a given. However, this does not directly imply that the cookies are in the jar because \"might not\" introduces uncertainty rather than a definitive exclusion of the possibility of being hidden. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\" from the given statements.\n\n3. The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" coupled with \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" directly negates the second option of the necessity (must) of the cookies being hidden in the pantry. Since one of the two options is negated, we are left with the only other possibility from the original statement, which is that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" This is a clear case of disjunctive syllogism where if one disjunct is negated, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes, no, yes",
