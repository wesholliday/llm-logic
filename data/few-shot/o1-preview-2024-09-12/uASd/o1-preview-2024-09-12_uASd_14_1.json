Without information about how the test being in Chinese affects your ability to pass, we cannot conclude that studying hard will suffice under this new condition.\n\nIn logical terms, the original statement is conditional: **If** you study hard (**S**), **then** you will pass the test (**P**). However, the modified statement adds an extra condition: **If** you study hard **and** the test is in Chinese (**S \u2227 C**), **then** you will pass the test (**P**). This is not a valid inference because the additional condition (**C**) could impact the truth of the conclusion (**P**). \n\nFor example, if you do not understand Chinese, the test being in Chinese could prevent you from passing despite studying hard. Therefore, the inference is invalid without additional information confirming that the test language does not hinder your ability to pass.",
