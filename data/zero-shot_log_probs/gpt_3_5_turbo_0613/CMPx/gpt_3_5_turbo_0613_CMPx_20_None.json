    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",
