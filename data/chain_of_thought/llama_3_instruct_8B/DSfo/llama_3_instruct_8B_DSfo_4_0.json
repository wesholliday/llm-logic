This means that one of these options must be true, but we don't know which one.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know the cat isn't playing in the bedroom (statement 1).\n* We have two possibilities: either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch (statement 2).\n\nSince we've ruled out the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom, we can conclude that the other option must be true. Therefore, the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
