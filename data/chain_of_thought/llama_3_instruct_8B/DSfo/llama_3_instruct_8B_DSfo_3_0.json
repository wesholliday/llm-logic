The statement \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options: either the keys are in the cabinet (which we know is false) or they are in the drawer.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer. If they weren't in the drawer, then they would have to be in the cabinet, but we already know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
