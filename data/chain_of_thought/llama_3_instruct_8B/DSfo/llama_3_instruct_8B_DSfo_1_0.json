From the first statement, we know that Fido is not in the garden.\n3. The second statement says that either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that there are two possibilities:\n\t* Fido is in the garden (which we already know is false)\n\t* Fido is inside\n4. Since one of these possibilities must be true, and we've ruled out the first possibility (\"Fido is in the garden\"), it follows that the second possibility must be true: \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
