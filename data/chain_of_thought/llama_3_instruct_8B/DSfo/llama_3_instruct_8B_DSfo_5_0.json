We have two statements:\n\t* \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\"\n\t* \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\"\n2. From statement (1), we know that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n3. Statement (2) presents a disjunction: either the cookies are hidden in the pantry, or they are in the jar. This means that one of these two options must be true.\n4. Since we already know from statement (1) that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, this option is ruled out.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
