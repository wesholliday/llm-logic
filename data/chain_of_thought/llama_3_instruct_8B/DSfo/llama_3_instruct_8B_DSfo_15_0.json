We have two statements:\n\t* \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\"\n\t* \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet\"\n2. From statement (1), we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n3. Statement (2) gives us a disjunction: either the shoes are lined up by the door, or they are in the closet.\n4. Since we've already established that the shoes aren't lined up by the door (from statement 1), we can eliminate the first option from the disjunction.\n5. This leaves us with only one option remaining: the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
