We have two statements:\n\t* \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\"\n\t* \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\"\n2. From statement (1), we know that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n3. Statement (2) presents a disjunction, which means it's either true or false. If the sunglasses are not on her head (as stated in statement 1), then one of the two options must be true: either they're perched on her head or they're in her bag.\n4. Since we've already established that they're not on her head, the only remaining option is that they're in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
