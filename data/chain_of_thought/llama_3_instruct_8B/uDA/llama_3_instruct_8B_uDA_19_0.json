            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n2. However, the second part of the statement \"Tom did not watch football\" contradicts the first part, which means that the condition is not met.\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Jen watched basketball based on the original statement.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Jen's activity (watching or not watching basketball) because the initial conditional relationship is no longer valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
