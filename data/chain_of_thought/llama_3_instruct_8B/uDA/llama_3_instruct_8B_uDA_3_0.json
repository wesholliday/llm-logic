The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies that there is a relationship between James and the genre of the book.\n2. We are given additional information that \"the book was not written by James\". This means that the condition in the original statement (\"the book was written by James\") is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze what this means for our conclusion:\n\n* If the book were indeed a mystery novel, it would have to be because someone other than James wrote it (since we know James didn't write it).\n* However, there is no information that suggests anyone else wrote the book. We only know that James didn't write it.\n\nGiven this lack of information about who did write the book, we cannot conclude whether the book is a mystery novel or not. The original statement only provides a relationship between James and the genre, but since James didn't write the book, we can't infer anything about the genre from this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
