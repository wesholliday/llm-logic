The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies a conditional relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location.\n2. We are given that the dog was not inside (from the second part of the sentence).\n3. Since the dog is not inside, it means the condition in step 1 is not met.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the cat was outside because the condition for the cat to be outside (the dog being inside) is not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: no",
