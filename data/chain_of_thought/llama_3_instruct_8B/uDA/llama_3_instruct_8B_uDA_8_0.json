This means that if the vampire is in a certain state (awake), then the mummy must also be in that same state.\n2. However, we are given additional information: \"the vampire was not awake\". This contradicts the initial condition stated in step 1.\n\nGiven this new information, we can conclude that the mummy cannot be awake, as the conditional relationship between the two statements is no longer valid. If the vampire is not awake, then it's possible for the mummy to be asleep or in any other state besides awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
