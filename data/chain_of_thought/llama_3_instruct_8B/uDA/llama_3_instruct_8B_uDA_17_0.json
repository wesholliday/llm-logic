The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" implies a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n2. However, the second statement \"Ben did not eat pasta\" contradicts the first condition.\n3. Since Ben didn't eat pasta, the conditional relationship is no longer applicable.\n4. We cannot infer that Kate did not eat salad because there's no direct connection between Ben not eating pasta and Kate's food choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
