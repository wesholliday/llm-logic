The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n2. However, this statement does not imply that if the apple is not red, then the banana must be non-yellow.\n3. We are given additional information: \"The apple was not red\". This means we can conclude that the apple has a different color (not red).\n4. But this new information does not provide any direct connection between the apple's color and the banana's color. The original conditional statement only established a relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow, but it did not establish a relationship between the apple being non-red and the banana being non-yellow.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
