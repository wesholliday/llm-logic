            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. However, we are given additional information that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". This means that the condition in the original statement is not met (i.e., Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the original statement.\n4. However, we can still analyze the situation further. If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean that she bought something else (like the blue shirt). Similarly, if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean that he bought something else (like the red shirt).\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty whether Mark did or did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
