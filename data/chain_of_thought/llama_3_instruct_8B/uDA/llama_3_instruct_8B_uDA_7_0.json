It suggests that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish the race.\n2. However, we are given additional information: \"Alex did not finish the race\". This means that the condition in step 1 is not met (i.e., Alex did not finish the race).\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Chris finished the race. The conditional statement only implies a relationship between Alex and Chris's finishing times if the condition is true.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
