The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. However, we are given additional information that \"Joe did not go to the park\". This means that the condition in the original statement is not met (i.e., Joe did not go to the park).\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Lucy went to the zoo based on the original statement.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
