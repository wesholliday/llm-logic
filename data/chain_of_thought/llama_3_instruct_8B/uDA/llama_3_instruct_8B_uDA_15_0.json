The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that there is a correlation between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's mode of transportation.\n2. However, the statement also says \"Sam did not take a plane\". This means that Sam's actual mode of transportation is not a plane.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If Sam took a train (which is not the case), then Erin would have taken a plane (according to the initial correlation). But since Sam didn't take a plane, this scenario is ruled out.\n* If Sam took a car or any other mode of transportation, there is no direct correlation with Erin's mode of transportation. We can't infer anything about Erin's mode of transportation.\n\nSince we can't conclude anything about Erin's mode of transportation from the given information, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
