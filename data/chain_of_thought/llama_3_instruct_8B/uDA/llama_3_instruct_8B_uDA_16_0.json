The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies a conditional relationship between the shirt and pants.\n2. We are given that the shirt is not cotton.\n3. Since the shirt is not cotton, we cannot conclude that the pants are denim based on the original conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim when the shirt is indeed cotton. Since the shirt is not cotton, this condition is not met, and we cannot make any conclusions about the pants being denim or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
