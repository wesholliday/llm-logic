            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue. It suggests that if Mary is present at the wedding, Sue will also be present.\n2. However, we are given additional information: \"Mary was not at the wedding\". This means that the condition in step 1 is not met (Mary is not at the wedding).\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding solely based on Mary's absence from the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
