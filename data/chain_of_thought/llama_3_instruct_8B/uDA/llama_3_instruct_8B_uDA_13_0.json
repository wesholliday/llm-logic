The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck.\n2. However, this statement does not imply that if the car is not red, the truck must be blue. It only states that if the car is red, the truck is blue.\n3. The second statement \"The car was not red\" tells us that the car's actual color is not red.\n4. Since we don't know what the car's actual color is, we can't conclude anything about the truck's color based on this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue. We only know that the car was not red, but we have no information about the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
