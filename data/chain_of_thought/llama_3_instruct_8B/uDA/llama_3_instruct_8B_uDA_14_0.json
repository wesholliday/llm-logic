The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" implies a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"the bear was not in the cave\".\n3. Since the bear is not in the cave, we can conclude that the condition stated in the original statement (\"If the bear was in the cave\") is not met.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: \"then the wolf was in the den\". This conclusion is only valid if the condition is met (i.e., the bear is in the cave). Since the condition is not met, we cannot infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the wolf was not in the den. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the wolf's presence in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
