We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The splat might not have quanked\"\n\t* \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement with a consequent (\"then the splat must have quanked\"). This means that if the antecedent (\"the splat was morphed\") is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n3. We are trying to infer whether \"The splat was not morphed\" from these two statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the splat was not morphed, then it might or might not have quanked (from statement 1).\n* But if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked (from statement 2). This means that \"The splat was morphed\" is incompatible with \"The splat was not morphed\".\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The splat was not morphed\" is a possible scenario.\n\nAnswer: yes",
