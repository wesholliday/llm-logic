We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The smonk might not have plagged\"\n\t* \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement with a consequent (\"then the smonk must have plagged\"). This means that if the antecedent (\"the smonk was vreebled\") is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n3. We want to infer whether \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use a process of elimination:\n\n* If the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged (by statement 2).\n* But if the smonk might not have plagged (statement 1), then it cannot be the case that the smonk was vreebled.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
