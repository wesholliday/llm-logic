            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement with a hypothetical scenario: if the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink.\n3. Since Statement A says that the sneg might not have sproted the frink, we can conclude that there's a possibility that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n4. Now, let's consider the possibility that the sneg was crampled (as stated in Statement B). If it was crampled, then according to Statement B, it would have sproted the frink.\n5. However, we already concluded that there's a possibility that the sneg did not sproted the frink (from Statement A).\n6. This means that if the sneg was crampled, it would have contradicted our previous conclusion that the sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n7. Therefore, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled, because if it were, it would have sproted the frink, which is contradictory to Statement A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
