We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The flug might not have been zimmed\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement with two parts: the antecedent (\"if the flug was blummed\") and the consequent (\"then the flug must have been zimmed\").\n3. We are asked to infer whether \"The flug was not blummed\" from these statements.\n4. To do this, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n\t* Scenario 1: The flug is blummed\n\t\t+ If the flug is blummed, then it must have been zimmed (by Statement B)\n\t\t+ But we know that the flug might not have been zimmed (by Statement A), which contradicts the conclusion from Statement B. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\t* Scenario 2: The flug is not blummed\n\t\t+ In this case, there is no conflict with either statement, and we can conclude that the flug was indeed not blummed.\n\nSince we have shown that the only possible scenario where the flug is not blummed is consistent with both statements, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
