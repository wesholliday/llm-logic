We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The whiffle might not have tinked.\"\n\t* \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. We are asked to infer whether \"The whiffle was not shanked\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: The whiffle was shanked.\n\t+ If the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked (by the second statement).\n\t+ But we know that \"The whiffle might not have tinked\" (from the first statement). This is a contradiction, so this scenario cannot be true.\n* Scenario 2: The whiffle was not shanked.\n\nIn this case, there are no contradictions, and both statements can be true simultaneously. Therefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked\" is possible.\n\nAnswer: yes",
