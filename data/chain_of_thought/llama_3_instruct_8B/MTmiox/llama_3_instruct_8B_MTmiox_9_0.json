To do this, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The twonk was plinked.\nIn this scenario, statement 2 implies that the twonk must have been varnished. But this contradicts statement 1, which says that the twonk might not have been varnished. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: The twonk was not plinked.\nThis scenario does not contradict either of the given statements. It's a possible scenario where the twonk was not plinked and might or might not have been varnished.\n\nSince we've considered all possible scenarios, we can conclude that the twonk being not plinked is indeed a possibility. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: yes",
