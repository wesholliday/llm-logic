We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The clug might not have been snugged\"\n\t* \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"\n2. The second statement implies that if the clug is fleeked, it must be snugged. This means that being fleeked is a sufficient condition for being snugged.\n3. We are trying to infer whether \"The clug was not fleeked\" can be concluded from these statements.\n4. If we assume that the clug was not fleeked, then the second statement does not apply (since it only talks about the case where the clug is fleeked).\n5. In this scenario, the first statement \"The clug might not have been snugged\" still applies, since it's a possibility even if the clug is not fleeked.\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the clug was not fleeked from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
