We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The shank might not have been nugged\"\n\t* \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\"\n2. The second statement implies that if the shank is plooked, it must be nugged.\n3. We want to infer whether the shank was not plooked.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the shank might not have been nugged. This doesn't directly tell us about the plooking of the shank.\n\nHowever, if we combine this information with the second statement, we can deduce that if the shank is not nugged (from the first statement), it cannot be plooked either (since being plooked implies being nugged).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
