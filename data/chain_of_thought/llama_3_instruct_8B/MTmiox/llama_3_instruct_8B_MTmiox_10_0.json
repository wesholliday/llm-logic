We want to know if we can conclude that \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the wug was not garpled. But this doesn't give us any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the wug is not sproinged. It only talks about the necessary condition for being sproinged (i.e., being garpled).\n\nSince we don't know whether the wug was sproinged or not, and we also don't have any additional information that would allow us to conclude that it wasn't sproinged, we cannot infer that \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: no",
