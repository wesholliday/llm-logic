            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The fribble might not have crinked\"\n\t* \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. We are asked to infer whether \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: The fribble was snurgled\n\t+ If the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked (by the second statement)\n\t+ But the first statement says that \"The fribble might not have crinked\", which contradicts the conclusion from the second statement. This scenario is impossible.\n* Scenario 2: The fribble was not snurgled\n\t+ In this case, there is no need to consider the second statement, as it only applies when the fribble is snurgled.\n\nFrom these scenarios, we can conclude that if the fribble might not have crinked (as stated in the first sentence), then it must be the case that the fribble was not snurgled. This is because if the fribble were snurgled, it would have to crinked, but this contradicts the possibility that it might not have crinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
