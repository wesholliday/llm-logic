It implies that these are the only two possible locations for the phone.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the phone were not ringing in the kitchen (as stated in 1), then it must be in the living room (according to 2). This is because if it weren't in the living room, it would have to be ringing in the kitchen, which we know might not be the case.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
