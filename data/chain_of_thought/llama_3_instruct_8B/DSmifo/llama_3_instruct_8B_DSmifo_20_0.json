We have two statements:\n\t* \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\"\n\t* \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\"\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options: either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n3. Since the first statement says that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, we can conclude that there's a possibility that they're not perched on her head.\n4. Given this possibility, we cannot directly infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. The second statement only provides two options, but it doesn't guarantee which one is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: no",
