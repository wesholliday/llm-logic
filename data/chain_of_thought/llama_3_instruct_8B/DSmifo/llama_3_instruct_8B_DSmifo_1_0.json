The second statement is a disjunction, which means it's saying that one of the two options (Fido being in the garden or Fido being inside) must be true.\n3. Since we know that \"Fido might not be in the garden\", this implies that the first option (\"Fido must be in the garden\") is false.\n4. Therefore, by the disjunction principle, we can conclude that the second option (\"Fido is inside\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
