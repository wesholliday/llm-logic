We have two statements:\n\t* \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\"\n\t* \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\"\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options: either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n3. Since the first statement says that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, we can conclude that there's a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n4. Given this possibility, we cannot directly infer that the cookies are in the jar. The second statement only provides two options, but it doesn't provide any information about which one is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no",
