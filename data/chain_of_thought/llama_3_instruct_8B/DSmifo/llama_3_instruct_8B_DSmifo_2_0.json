It implies that these are the only two possible locations for the book.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. This means that the first option in statement 2 (\"the book must be resting on the table\") is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the second option (\"it is on the shelf\") is still possible, and it's the only remaining option, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
