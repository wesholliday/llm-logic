If the first option is true, then the second option must be false, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cat is not playing in the bedroom (as stated in statement 1), then we can infer that the cat might be napping on the couch (since it's one of the two mutually exclusive options).\n\nAnswer: yes",
