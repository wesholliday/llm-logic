It doesn't explicitly state that the pen is in the bag, but rather provides a choice between two possibilities.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the pen is not on the desk (as stated in statement 1), then it must be in the bag (according to statement 2).\n* However, we can't conclude for certain that the pen is indeed in the bag. The possibility remains that the pen might not be in the bag either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The pen is in my bag\". There's still a chance that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
