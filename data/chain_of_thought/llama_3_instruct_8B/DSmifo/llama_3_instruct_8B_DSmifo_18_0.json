This means that if the notebook is not on the nightstand (as stated in statement 1), then it must be in the drawer.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that since the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, and either it's on the nightstand or in the drawer, then it follows that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
