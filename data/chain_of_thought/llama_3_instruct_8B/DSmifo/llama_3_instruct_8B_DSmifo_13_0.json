It implies that these are the only two possible locations for the toy.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf (statement 1), then there is a possibility that it's actually in the toy box (since statement 2 says either/or).\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that the toy is indeed in the toy box. The first statement only suggests a possibility, but doesn't provide conclusive evidence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\" with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
