The statement \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" is a disjunction, which means it's saying that one of two things must be true: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* It's possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (from statement 1).\n* If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer (from statement 2).\n\nSo, we can infer that the keys are indeed in the drawer. Therefore,\n\nAnswer: yes",
