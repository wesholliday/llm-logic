This means that if the remote control is not under the couch (as stated in 1), then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n* If it's not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
