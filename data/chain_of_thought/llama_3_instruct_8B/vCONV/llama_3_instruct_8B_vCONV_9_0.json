However, this is not a valid logical operation.\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion should logically follow from the premise(s). In this case, the conclusion is attempting to draw a new conditional statement that is not supported by the original premise.\n\nFor example, if we know that Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark indeed bought the blue shirt. But just because Mark bought the blue shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other scenarios where Mark bought the blue shirt for some reason unrelated to Lisa's purchase of the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
