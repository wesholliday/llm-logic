However, the premise only establishes a connection between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter, but it doesn't provide any information about the converse.\n\nIn other words, just because the alien visited Mars implies that the robot visited Jupiter, but we can't infer from this that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. The conclusion is trying to make a leap that isn't justified by the premise.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
