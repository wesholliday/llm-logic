However, this reversal doesn't necessarily follow logically from the premise.\n\nTo see why, let's consider a counterexample. Suppose the apple was indeed red, but the banana was not just yellow, but also green. In this case, the premise would be true (the apple being red implies the banana being yellow), but the conclusion would be false (the banana being yellow does not imply the apple being red).\n\nThis shows that the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
