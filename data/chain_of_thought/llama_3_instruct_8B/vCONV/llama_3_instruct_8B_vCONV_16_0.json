However, the original premise only establishes a connection between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim, but it doesn't imply that the converse is true.\n\nIn other words, just because the pants are denim, we can't conclude that the shirt was cotton. The original premise only provides information about the shirt's material when the pants' material is denim, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
