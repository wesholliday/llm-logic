However, the premise only establishes a relationship between \"book was written by James\" and \"book is a mystery novel\".\n\nNotice that the premise is saying \"if-then\", which means it's making a claim about the necessary condition for something to be true. In this case, it's saying that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, is trying to flip this relationship around and say that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. However, this is not logically justified because the premise only talks about the condition for something to be true, but doesn't provide any information about the converse.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel, it doesn't mean that if the book is a mystery novel, then James must have written it. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels!\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
