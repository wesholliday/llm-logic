However, the premise only talks about Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n\nNotice that the premise doesn't provide any information about the reverse scenario (Tom not watching football or Jen not watching basketball). The conclusion is trying to make an inference based on the opposite scenario, which is not supported by the premise.\n\nIn other words, the argument is attempting to establish a causal relationship between Tom's actions and Jen's actions, but it only provides evidence for one direction of the relationship. This is a classic example of a flawed argument, known as \"equivocation\" or \"fallacy of converse\".\n\nAnswer: no",
