However, there seems to be a mismatch in the premises and conclusions. The premise talks about Alex and Chris finishing a \"race\", whereas the conclusion mentions Chris finishing a \"face\".\n\nA face is not a type of race or competition, so it's unclear what kind of relationship exists between Chris finishing a face and Alex finishing a race. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine whether the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
