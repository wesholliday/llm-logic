However, the original premise only establishes a connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence, but it doesn't imply that their presence is equivalent.\n\nIn other words, just because Mary being at the wedding implies Sue being at the wedding, it doesn't mean that Sue being at the wedding implies Mary being at the wedding. The conclusion is trying to make an unjustified leap by reversing the direction of the implication.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
