However, the premise only establishes a relationship between the bear being in the case and the wolf being in the den.\n\nNotice that the premise does not provide any information about the reverse situation: whether the wolf being in the den implies the bear being in the case. The conclusion is trying to make an inference from the wolf's presence in the den to the bear's presence in the case, but this is not supported by the given premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it attempts to draw a conclusion that is not justified by the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
