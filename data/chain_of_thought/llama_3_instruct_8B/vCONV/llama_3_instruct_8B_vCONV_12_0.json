However, the premise only establishes a connection between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, but it doesn't provide any information about the converse.\n\nIn other words, just because Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo, we can't conclude that if Lucy goes to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. The premise only provides a one-way implication, not a two-way implication.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: no",
