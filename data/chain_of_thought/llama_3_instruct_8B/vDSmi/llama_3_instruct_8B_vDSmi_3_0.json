            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. This can be represented as a disjunction: (K \u222a D) where K represents the keys being in the drawer and D represents the keys being dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The second premise states that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, which can be represented as \u00acD.\n3. The conclusion is that the keys are in the drawer, which can be represented as K.\n\nUsing logical operators, we can rewrite the argument as:\n\n(K \u222a D) \u2227 \u00acD \u22a2 K\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nK \u22a2 K\n\nWhich is a tautology, meaning it's always true. This suggests that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
