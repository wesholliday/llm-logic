Premise 1: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the shelf\"\nThis premise states that there are only two possibilities for the location of the toy.\n\n2. Premise 2: \"The toy might not be sitting on the shelf\"\nThis premise suggests that one of those possibilities (the toy being on the shelf) is actually false.\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The toy is in the toy box\"\nIf the toy is not on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box according to Premise 1.
