This can be represented as a disjunction: (P \u222a Q)\n2. The second premise states that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. This can be represented as \u00acQ\n3. The conclusion claims that the missing puzzle piece is in the box, which can be represented as P\n\nUsing logical operators, we can rewrite the argument as:\n\n(P \u222a Q) \u2227 \u00acQ \u22a2 P\n\nThis is a valid form of argument, known as modus ponens with a disjunction. It follows the rules of logic because it uses the principle of excluded middle (\u00acP \u2228 P) and the fact that if P \u222a Q is true, then either P or Q must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
