The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" implies that there is a possibility (less than 100%) that the griffin was not in the forest.\n2. This possibility means that it's not certain or guaranteed that the griffin was in the forest.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it's possible for the griffin to have been outside of the forest.\n4. Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".\n5. This statement is equivalent to saying that there is no necessity or obligation for the griffin to be in the forest.\n6. Given the possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest (from step 1), we can conclude that it's indeed possible for the griffin not to be in the forest, which means there is no necessity or obligation for it to be there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
