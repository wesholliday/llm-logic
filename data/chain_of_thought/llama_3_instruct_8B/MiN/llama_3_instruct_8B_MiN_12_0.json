The sentence \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" implies that there is a possibility (i.e., less than certainty) that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n2. This possibility does not necessarily imply that the jacket must not be draped over the chair. In other words, just because it's possible for the jacket to not be draped over the chair doesn't mean it's impossible or necessary for it to not be draped over the chair.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
