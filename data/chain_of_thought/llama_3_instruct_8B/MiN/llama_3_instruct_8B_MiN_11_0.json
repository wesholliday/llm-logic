The sentence \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" implies that there is a possibility (less than 100%) that the newspaper is not in the driveway.\n2. This possibility means that it's not certain or guaranteed that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it's possible for the newspaper to NOT be in the driveway.\n4. Since \"it's not the case\" is a negation of \"it is the case\", we can conclude that it's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
