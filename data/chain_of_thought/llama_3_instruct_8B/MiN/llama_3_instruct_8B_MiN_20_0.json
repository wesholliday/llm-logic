The sentence \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" implies that there is a possibility (less than 100%) that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n2. This possibility means that it's not certain or guaranteed that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it's possible for the sunglasses to NOT be in her bag.\n4. From this inference, we can conclude that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
