The sentence \"The milk might not be on the counter\" implies that there is a possibility (i.e., less than certainty) that the milk is not on the counter.\n2. This possibility means that it is not ruled out that the milk could be somewhere else, such as in the fridge or on the table.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the milk must be on the counter.\n4. The sentence does not provide any information about whether the milk must be on the counter or not; it only suggests a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
