This possibility means that it's not certain that Mary was at the wedding, and therefore, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that she must have been at the wedding.\n3. The negation of \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\".\n4. Since we've established that it's possible (but not certain) that Mary was not at the wedding, we can infer that it's indeed not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
