The statement \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" implies that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n2. This possibility means that it is not certain that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n4. Since we cannot rule out the possibility that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, it follows that \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
