The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" implies that there is a possibility (i.e., less than certainty) that the toy is not in the toy box.\n2. This possibility means that it is not ruled out that the toy could be somewhere else, or even nowhere at all.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the toy must be in the toy box.\n4. The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" is equivalent to saying that there are other possibilities for where the toy could be.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
