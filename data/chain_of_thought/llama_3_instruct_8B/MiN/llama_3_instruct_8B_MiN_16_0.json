The sentence \"The pen might not be in my bag\" is a statement about possibility, indicating that there is a chance the pen is not in the bag.\n2. This implies that it is possible for the pen to not be in the bag.\n3. From this, we can infer that it is not necessary or guaranteed that the pen must be in the bag.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
