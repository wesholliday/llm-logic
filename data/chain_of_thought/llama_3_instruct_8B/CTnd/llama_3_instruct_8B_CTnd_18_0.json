It doesn't necessarily mean that if an issue is discussed in depth, it wasn't discussed.\n\nHowever, we can use a technique called \"contrapositive\" to infer the opposite statement:\n\n\"If the issue was not discussed, then it was discussed\"\n\nThis is equivalent to saying:\n\n\"If the issue was discussed, then it was not not discussed\"\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n\"If the issue was discussed, then it was discussed\"\n\nNow we can combine this with the original statement:\n\n\"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\"\n\"If the issue was discussed, then it was discussed\" (derived from contrapositive)\n\nWe can conclude that if an issue was discussed, it's either not discussed in depth or it is discussed. This means we can infer that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was indeed discussed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
