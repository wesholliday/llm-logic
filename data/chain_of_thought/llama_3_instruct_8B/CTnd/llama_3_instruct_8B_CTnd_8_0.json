It's saying that the issue still exists or has not been resolved properly.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite:\n\n\"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\"\n\nThis inferred statement seems to be saying that if an issue is addressed effectively, it means that it wasn't actually addressed at all. This doesn't make sense, as addressing something effectively implies that the problem has been resolved or mitigated.\n\nThe given statement and its negation are logically inconsistent with each other. The original statement suggests that ineffective addressing leads to unresolved issues, while the inferred statement would imply that effective addressing leads to unaddressed issues.\n\nAnswer: no",
