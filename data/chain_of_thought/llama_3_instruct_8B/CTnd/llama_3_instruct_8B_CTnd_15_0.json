This implies that there is some level of tidying that is less than thorough.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion we want to infer:\n\n\"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\"\n\nThis statement is saying that if the room was tidied in a way that is complete and perfect (i.e., thoroughly), then it was not tidied at all. This seems counterintuitive, as one would expect that if something is done thoroughly, it means it's being done completely.\n\nHowever, we can rephrase the conclusion to make it more accurate:\n\n\"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was tidied (but not necessarily tidied again)\"\n\nThis revised statement is saying that if the room was tidied in a way that is complete and perfect, then it has been tidied at least once. This is consistent with the original statement, which implies that there is some level of tidying that is less than thorough.\n\nGiven this rephrased conclusion, we can see that the original statement does not provide enough information to infer the revised conclusion. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
