This statement implies that exercising and exercising strenuously are mutually exclusive.\n3. If exercising strenuously means the opposite of exercising (i.e., not exercising), then we can infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, it would mean she didn't exercise at all.\n4. However, this inference is only possible because exercising strenuously is equivalent to not exercising in this context.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
