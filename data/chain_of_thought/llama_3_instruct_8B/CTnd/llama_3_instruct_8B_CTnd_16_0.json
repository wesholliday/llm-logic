This seems counterintuitive, as \"completed well\" implies that the job was indeed finished.\n\nHowever, we can rephrase the original statement to make it more symmetric:\n\n\"If the job was not completed well, then it was completed\"\n\nThis revised statement is saying that if a job did not meet certain standards of quality (i.e., \"not completed well\"), then it still got finished (i.e., \"completed\").\n\nBy doing so, we can see that the original statement and its rephrased version are logically equivalent. This means that we can indeed infer the opposite statement:\n\n\"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
