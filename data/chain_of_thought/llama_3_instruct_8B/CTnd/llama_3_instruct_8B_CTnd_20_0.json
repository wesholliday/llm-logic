This implies that if a strong recommendation were to be made, it would not be considered a recommendation.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite:\n\n\"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\"\n\nTo determine whether this inference is valid, we need to see if the original statement provides any information about what happens when a strong recommendation is made. The original statement only talks about what happens when a recommendation is made (i.e., it's not strong). It doesn't provide any information about what happens when a strong recommendation is made.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't provide any relevant information, we cannot infer that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. The two statements are logically independent, and we can't conclude one from the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
