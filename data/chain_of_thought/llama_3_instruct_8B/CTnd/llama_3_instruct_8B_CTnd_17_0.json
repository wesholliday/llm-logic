This implies that there are two possible scenarios:\n\t* Scenario 1: The customer was greeted and was not greeted warmly.\n\t* Scenario 2: The customer was not greeted (or was not greeted at all).\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\".\n4. This implies that there are two possible scenarios:\n\t* Scenario 1: The customer was greeted warmly and was not greeted.\n\t* Scenario 2: The customer was not greeted (or was not greeted at all).\n\nNotice a pattern? Both scenarios in the converse statement have the same possibilities as the original statement! This means that the converse statement is logically equivalent to the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" is indeed true, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
