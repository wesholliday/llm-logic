This implies that there is a relationship between the provision of directions and their explanation.\n3. If we negate both parts of the original statement, we get: \"If directions were NOT provided, then they WERE explained clearly\".\n4. Now, let's try to infer the opposite statement: \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were NOT provided\".\n\nNotice that this new statement is actually equivalent to the negation of the original statement (step 3). This means that if we can logically conclude the original statement, we can also logically conclude its negation.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
