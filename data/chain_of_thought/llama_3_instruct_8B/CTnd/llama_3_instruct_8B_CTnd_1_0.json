            "content": "Let's break down the given statement \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\".\n\nThis is a conditional statement that implies two things:\n\n1. If it's raining (the antecedent), then\n2. It's not raining hard (the consequent)\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement we want to infer: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\". This statement is trying to say the opposite of what the original statement says.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this new statement from the given one, we need to check if the original statement implies the negation of the new statement. In other words, does the original statement imply \"If it's raining hard, then it IS raining\"?\n\nThe key insight here is that the original statement only talks about \"raining\" and \"not raining hard\", but not about \"raining hard\". The antecedent \"it's raining\" doesn't specify the intensity of the rain. Therefore, we can't conclude anything about \"raining hard\" from the given statement.\n\nIn fact, it's possible that it's raining hard while still being true that it's not raining hard (if there are multiple levels of intensity). This means that the original statement does NOT imply the negation of the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
