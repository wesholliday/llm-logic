This is because the statement explicitly states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If helpful advice was offered\". If helpful advice was indeed offered, then by the definition of helpful advice, it would mean that the advice was useful and effective. However, this contradicts the first statement which says that if advice was offered, it was not helpful.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. This is because the existence of helpful advice implies that the original advice offered was not helpful, which in turn means that no advice was actually offered (since the original advice was non-helpful).\n\nAnswer: yes",
