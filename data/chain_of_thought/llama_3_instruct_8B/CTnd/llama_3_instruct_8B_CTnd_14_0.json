This means we can't directly conclude the desired statement from the given one.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive rule to help us. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not-Q then not-P\". Applying this rule to our original statement:\n\n\"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully\"\n\nWe get:\n\n\"If the meal was not prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\"\n\nNow, we can see that the consequent of this contrapositive statement is similar to what we want to infer (\"it was not prepared\"). This means we can conclude that if the meal was prepared carefully (which implies it was prepared), then it must have been prepared.\n\nAnswer: yes",
