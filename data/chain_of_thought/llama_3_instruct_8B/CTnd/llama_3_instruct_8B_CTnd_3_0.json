This is an if-then statement, which means that the antecedent (eating a meal) implies the consequent (not eating a large meal).\n2. We want to infer the converse of this statement, which would be \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\".\n3. To do this, we need to swap the antecedent and consequent of the original statement.\n4. The original statement says that eating a meal implies not eating a large meal. This means that if you eat a meal, it's possible that you didn't eat a large meal (because there are other possibilities, like eating a small or medium-sized meal).\n5. If we swap the antecedent and consequent, we get \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\". This statement says that eating a large meal implies not eating a meal.\n6. However, this implication is not necessarily true. It's possible to eat a large meal and still eat a meal (because there are other possibilities, like having multiple meals or having a large snack).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
