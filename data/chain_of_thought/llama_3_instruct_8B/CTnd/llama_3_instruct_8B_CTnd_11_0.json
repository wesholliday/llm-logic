This statement implies that going to the store and buying vegetables are mutually exclusive events.\n3. If we negate both parts of the original statement, we get: \"If I did not go to the store, then I bought vegetables\" (this is equivalent to the original statement).\n4. Now, let's try to infer the opposite: \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\".\n5. This statement implies that buying vegetables and going to the store are also mutually exclusive events.\n6. Since we already established in step 2 that going to the store and buying vegetables are mutually exclusive, it follows logically that buying vegetables and going to the store are indeed mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
