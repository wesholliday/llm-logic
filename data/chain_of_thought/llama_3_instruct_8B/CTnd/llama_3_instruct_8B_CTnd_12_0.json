This implies that studying and studying long are mutually exclusive events.\n3. If studying and studying long were not mutually exclusive, we could have a scenario where Jane studies and also studies long, which would contradict the original statement.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that if Jane studied, it means she did not study long.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\".\n\n1. We know that studying and studying long are mutually exclusive events (from step 2).\n2. If Jane studied long, it implies that she did not study (since they are mutually exclusive).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if Jane studied long, indeed, she did not study.\n\nAnswer: yes",
