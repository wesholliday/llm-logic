This implies that there is a relationship between the two clauses: if instructions are given, then they must not be explained clearly.\n3. To infer the opposite statement, we need to flip the condition and conclusion.\n\nThe inferred statement would be: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given\".\n\n4. This new statement implies that there is a relationship between the two clauses: if instructions are explained clearly, then they must not have been given.\n5. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens when instructions are explained clearly. It only talks about the relationship between \"instructions being given\" and \"instructions being explained clearly\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the opposite statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
