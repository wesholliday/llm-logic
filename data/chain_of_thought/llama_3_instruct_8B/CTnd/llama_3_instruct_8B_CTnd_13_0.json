This statement implies that exercising (the antecedent) leads to not exercising much (the consequent).\n3. Now, we want to infer the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\".\n4. To do this, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement.\n5. Negating the antecedent \"Alex exercised\" gives us \"Alex did not exercise\", which is equivalent to \"Alex exercised much\" (since exercising implies doing it a lot).\n6. Negating the consequent \"he did not exercise much\" gives us \"he exercised much\".\n7. Combining these negations, we get \"If Alex did not exercise, then he exercised much\".\n\nThis new statement is logically equivalent to the original one, but with the antecedent and consequent swapped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
