This implies that if a customer was served, it means they were not served promptly.\n3. Now, we need to infer the converse: \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\".\n\nFrom the original statement, we can't directly conclude that if a customer was served promptly, then they were not served. The original statement only talks about the relationship between being served and being served promptly, but it doesn't provide any information about the converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
