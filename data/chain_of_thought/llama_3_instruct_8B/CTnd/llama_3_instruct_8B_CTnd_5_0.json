This implies that there might be some level of cleaning, but it's not sufficient.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite statement:\n\n\"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\"\n\nThis statement would mean that if the room was cleaned thoroughly (i.e., with great care and attention), then it wasn't cleaned at all. This seems counterintuitive, as thorough cleaning implies a certain level of effort and completion.\n\nHowever, we can rephrase the original statement to get closer to the inferred statement:\n\n\"If the room was not cleaned thoroughly, then it was cleaned\"\n\nThis revised statement is saying that if the room wasn't cleaned thoroughly, then some level of cleaning occurred. This is more in line with our initial understanding of the original statement.\n\nNow, let's try to flip this revised statement again to get closer to the inferred statement:\n\n\"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\"\n\nThis flipped statement is saying that if the room was cleaned (at all), then it wasn't done thoroughly. Ah-ha! This looks familiar!\n\nWe've essentially arrived at the original statement, which means we can indeed infer the opposite statement:\n\n\"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
