From statement 2, we know that the pants are indeed denim.\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true.\n4. Since we don't have any information about the shirt being cotton or not, we can't conclude that the shirt is indeed cotton.\n5. However, since we know the pants are denim (from statement 2), and the conditional statement says \"if the shirt was cotton\", it implies that if the shirt were cotton, then the pants would be denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
