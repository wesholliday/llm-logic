The first statement is an implication (if-then), which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n3. We know that the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is indeed true, as stated in the second statement.\n4. However, we don't have any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nSince we can't conclude for certain whether Tom watched football or not, we cannot logically conclude that \"Tom watched football\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
