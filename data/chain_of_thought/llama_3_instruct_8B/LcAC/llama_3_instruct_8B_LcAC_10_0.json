From statement 2, we know that the cat is indeed outside.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the dog being inside) is true.\n\n4. Since we already know from statement 2 that the cat is outside, this doesn't necessarily mean the dog is inside. The cat could be outside for some other reason, not because the dog is inside.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"The dog was inside\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
