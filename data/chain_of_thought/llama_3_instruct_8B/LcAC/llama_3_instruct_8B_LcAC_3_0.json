We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* The book is a mystery novel (fact)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n3. Now, we have the fact that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n4. Since the book is a mystery novel, and from our previous inference, we know that if the book was written by James, it would also be a mystery novel... \n5. ...we can conclude that the book being a mystery novel is a sufficient condition for the book to have been written by James.\n\nIn other words, we've established a logical connection between the two statements:\n\nIf the book was written by James \u2192 The book is a mystery novel\nThe book is a mystery novel \u2192 The book was written by James\n\nThis is an example of a logical equivalence, where the two statements are equivalent in terms of their truth value. Therefore...\n\nAnswer: yes",
