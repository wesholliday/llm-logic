We have two statements:\n\t* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (conditional statement)\n\t* Erin took a train (factual statement)\n2. The conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that if Sam takes a plane, it will lead to Erin taking a train.\n3. We know that Erin did take a train, as stated in the factual statement \"Erin took a train\".\n4. However, we don't have any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not.\n\nFrom these steps, we can conclude that:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train (based on the conditional statement)\n* We know Erin did take a train (based on the factual statement)\n\nBut we still don't know if Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude \"Sam took a plane\" based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
