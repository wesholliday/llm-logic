We have two statements:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (conditional statement)\n\t* The unicorn was in the forest (additional information)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that the unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\n3. Now, let's examine the conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\". This means that if the griffin were in the forest, it would necessarily imply that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\n4. Since we already know that the unicorn is indeed in the forest (from step 2), this implies that the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" must be true as well.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the conditional statement and the additional information, we can logically conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
