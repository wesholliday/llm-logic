The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n3. However, we don't know whether Sue chose pizza or not. We only know that Bob chose pasta.\n4. Since we don't have any information about Sue's choice, we can't conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: no",
