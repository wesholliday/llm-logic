This implies that the possibility of the clug not being fleeked is left open, since if it were necessary for the clug to be fleeked, then it would be impossible for it not to be fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The clug might not have been fleeked\", as the necessity of its being fleeked has been denied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
