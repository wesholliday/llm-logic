This implies that the possibility of the dreb not being vroombed is left open, since if it were necessary for the dreb to be vroombed, then it would be impossible for it not to be vroombed.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n\n3. The dreb might not have been vroombed, because the necessity of its being vroombed has been denied, leaving open the possibility that it was not vroombed at all.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAnswer: yes",
