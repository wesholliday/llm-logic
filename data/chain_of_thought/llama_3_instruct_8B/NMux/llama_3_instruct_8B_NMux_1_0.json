The negation of a statement is equivalent to its contrapositive. So, we can rewrite the original statement as \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\".\n3. Since the original statement is false, it means that the flugel might indeed have been blimmed (or it might not have been).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether the flugel was or wasn't blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
