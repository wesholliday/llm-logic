The negation of a categorical statement (e.g., \"must\") is another categorical statement with the opposite polarity (e.g., \"might not\"). So, we can rephrase the original sentence as \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\".\n3. Since the original sentence is false, it implies that the possibility of the smonk being vreebled is not ruled out entirely.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that there is a chance (albeit small) that the smonk was indeed vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
