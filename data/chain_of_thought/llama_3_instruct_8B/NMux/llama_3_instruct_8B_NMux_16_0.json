This statement does not imply that the sneg cannot be crumped, only that it doesn't have to be.\n3. The negation of \"must\" is \"might not\", which means that the possibility of the sneg not being crumped is still open.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg might not have been crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
