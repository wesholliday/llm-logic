From this, we can conclude that it's possible that the zinger was not fraggled (since it's not necessarily true that it must be fraggled).\n3. The statement \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" is equivalent to saying that it's possible that the zinger was not fraggled.\n4. Since we've already concluded that it's possible that the zinger was not fraggled, we can infer that the statement \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
