This implies that the possibility of the flob not being skizzled is left open, since if it were necessary for the flob to be skizzled, then it would be impossible for it not to be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" because the original statement denies the necessity of the flob being skizzled, leaving room for the possibility that it might not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
