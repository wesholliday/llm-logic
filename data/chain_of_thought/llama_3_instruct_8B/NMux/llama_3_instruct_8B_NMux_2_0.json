This statement does not imply that the wug definitely wasn't flooped, only that it's possible for the wug to not be flooped.\n\nNow, let's consider \"The wug might not have been flooped\". This statement implies that there is a possibility (or possibilities) where the wug was not flooped. Since we already established that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped\" implies at least one such possibility, we can indeed infer that \"The wug might not have been flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
