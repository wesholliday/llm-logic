This implies that there is at least one possible scenario where the fleeg might not be bluttered.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\". This statement is saying that there is a possibility (not necessarily a high probability) that the fleeg did not undergo bluttering.\n\nGiven the initial statement, we know that it's not necessary for the fleeg to be bluttered. Therefore, it's possible that the fleeg might not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
