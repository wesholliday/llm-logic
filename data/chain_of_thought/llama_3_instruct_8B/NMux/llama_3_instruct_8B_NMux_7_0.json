The negation of a statement is equivalent to its contrapositive. So, we can rewrite the original statement as \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\".\n3. Since the original statement is false, it means that the whiffle might indeed have been shanked (but we don't know for sure).\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the whiffle might not have been shanked. It's possible that the whiffle was shanked, but we just can't conclude that with certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
