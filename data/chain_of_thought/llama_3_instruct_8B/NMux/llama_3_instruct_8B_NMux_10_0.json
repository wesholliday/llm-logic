This statement does not imply that the wug might be sproinged, only that it's not necessary for the wug to be sproinged.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the possibility of the wug not being sproinged is left open. Since \"it's not the case\" implies a negation of necessity, it also implies that other possibilities (including the possibility of the wug not being sproinged) are still viable.\n\nAnswer: yes",
