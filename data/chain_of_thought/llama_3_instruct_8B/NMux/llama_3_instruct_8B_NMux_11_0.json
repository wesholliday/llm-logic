The negation of a modal statement (e.g., \"must\", \"might\") is another modal statement with the opposite polarity. In this case, we can infer that \"The flug might not have been blummed\" is true.\n\nReasoning: If it's not necessary for the flug to be blummed, then it's possible that it wasn't blummed. The negation of necessity implies possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
