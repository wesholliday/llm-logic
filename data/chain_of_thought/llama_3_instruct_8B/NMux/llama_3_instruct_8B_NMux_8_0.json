This does not necessarily imply that the sprocket might not have been cranked, as there could be other possibilities (e.g., it was cranked, but not necessarily).\n3. However, since we know that the sprocket must not have been cranked (from the initial statement), we can infer that the possibility of it being cranked is eliminated.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\" is a logical consequence of the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
