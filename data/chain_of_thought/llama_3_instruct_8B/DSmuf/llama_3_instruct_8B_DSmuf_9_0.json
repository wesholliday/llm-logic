We have two statements:\n\t* Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\t* It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor (since \"it's not the case\" implies the opposite).\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1 again: Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\n4. Since we've already concluded that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor (step 2), we can eliminate the first option (\"blending in on the floor\") and focus on the second option (\"it is in the box\").\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece must indeed be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
