We have two statements:\n\t* Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand (\u00acN)\n2. From statement E, we know that there are only two possibilities: the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n3. Statement \u00acN tells us that it's not possible for the notebook to be on the nightstand. This means that the first possibility from step 2 is ruled out.\n4. Since the first possibility is ruled out, we are left with only one option: the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
