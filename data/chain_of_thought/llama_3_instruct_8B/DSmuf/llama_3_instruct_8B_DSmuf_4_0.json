We have two statements:\n\t* Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom (\u00acP)\n2. From statement E, we can conclude that either P (the cat is playing in the bedroom) or \u00acP (it's not the case that the cat is playing in the bedroom).\n3. Since \u00acP (from statement \u00acP), we know that P is false.\n4. Now, we combine this with statement E: Either P or \u00acP. Since P is false, we can conclude that \u00acP must be true.\n5. From statement E again, we know that either P or \u00acP. Since we've already concluded that \u00acP is true, we can infer that \u00acP (the cat is napping on the couch) must be the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
