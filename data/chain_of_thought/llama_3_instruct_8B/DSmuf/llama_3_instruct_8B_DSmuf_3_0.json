We have two statements:\n\t* Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\t* It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that:\n\n2. The keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet (since it's not the case).\n\nNow, let's look at the first statement again:\n\t* Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nSince we've already established that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet, this means that:\n\n3. The keys must be in the drawer (since it's the only remaining option).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the keys are indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
