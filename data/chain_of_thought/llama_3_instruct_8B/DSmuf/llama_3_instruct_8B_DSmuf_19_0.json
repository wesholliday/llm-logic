We have two statements:\n\t* Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist (N)\n2. From statement E, we can conclude that either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n3. From statement N, we know that it's not possible for the watch to be on his wrist.\n4. Since the watch cannot be on his wrist (from N), and either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser (from E), we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
