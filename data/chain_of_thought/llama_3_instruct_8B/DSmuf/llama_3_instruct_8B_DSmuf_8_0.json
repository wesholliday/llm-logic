The first option \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there are only two possibilities for the location of the remote control: under the couch or somewhere else (which we'll call X).\n3. However, the second statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" tells us that the first option is false.\n4. Since the first option is false, it means that the remote control is indeed in location X, which is not under the couch.\n5. The only other possibility mentioned is the coffee table, so we can conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
