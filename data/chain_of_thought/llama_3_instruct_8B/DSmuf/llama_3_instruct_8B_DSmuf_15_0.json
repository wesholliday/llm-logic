We have two statements:\n\t* Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\n\t* It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\n2. From the second statement, we can conclude that the shoes are not lined up by the door (since it's not the case).\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: \"Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\" This is a disjunction, which means one of the two options must be true.\n\n4. Since we've already concluded that the shoes are not lined up by the door (from step 2), this option is ruled out.\n\n5. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
