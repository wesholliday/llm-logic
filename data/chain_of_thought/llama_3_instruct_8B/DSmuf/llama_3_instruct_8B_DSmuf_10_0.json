We have two statements:\n\t* Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed (N)\n\n2. From statement N, we can conclude that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed. This means that there might be other possibilities for where the sock could be.\n\n3. Statement E provides two alternatives: either the sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. Since we've already established that the sock is not necessarily under the bed (N), this leaves us with only one possibility: the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
