We have two statements:\n\t* Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\n\t* It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that:\n\n2. The first statement implies that there are only two possibilities: either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. If it were possible for the umbrella to be somewhere else, the statement would not be exhaustive.\n3. The second statement tells us that the first possibility (the umbrella being tucked away in the closet) is not true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two pieces of information:\n\n4. Since the first possibility (umbrella in closet) is ruled out, we are left with only one option: the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
