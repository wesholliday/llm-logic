We have two statements:\n\t* Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\n\t* It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that the toy cannot be sitting on the bookshelf (since \"it's not the case\" implies negation).\n\n3. Since the toy cannot be sitting on the bookshelf, and either it must be sitting on the bookshelf or in the toy box, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
