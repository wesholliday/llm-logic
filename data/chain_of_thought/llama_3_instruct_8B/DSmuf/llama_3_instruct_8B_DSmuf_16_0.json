We have two statements:\n\t* \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\" (E)\n\t* \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" (\u00acD)\n2. From E, we can infer that either D (the pen is on my desk) or \u00acD (it's not the case that the pen is on my desk) is true.\n3. Since \u00acD is given to us, we know that D is false.\n4. Therefore, from E and \u00acD, we can conclude that \u00acD is true, which means the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
