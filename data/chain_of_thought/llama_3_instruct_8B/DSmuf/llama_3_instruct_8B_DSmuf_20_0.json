We have two statements:\n\t* Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\t* It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head (since it's not the case). This means that the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n2. The original statement \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\" ensures that one of these two options must be true. Since we've eliminated the first option (perched on her head), the second option (in her bag) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
