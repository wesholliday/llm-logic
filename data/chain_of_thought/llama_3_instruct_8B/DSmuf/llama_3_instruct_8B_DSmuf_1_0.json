            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n\t* Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside (this is an inclusive \"or\", meaning that one of the options must be true)\n\t* It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (this implies that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, but it doesn't say anything about whether he's inside)\n\n2. From the second premise, we can conclude that Fido might be outside the garden (since \"must\" implies necessity, and if it's not necessary for him to be in the garden, then he could be elsewhere).\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first premise again: Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. Since we've established that Fido might be outside the garden (from the second premise), this means that the first option (\"Fido must be in the garden\") is not true.\n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is indeed inside (since the first premise says \"or\" and one of the options has been ruled out).\n\nAnswer: yes",
