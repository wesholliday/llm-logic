We have two premises:\n\t* Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf (this is an exclusive OR statement, meaning only one of the options can be true)\n\t* It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table (this implies that the book cannot be on the table)\n\n2. From the second premise, we know that the book cannot be on the table.\n\n3. Since the first premise is an exclusive OR statement, and one of the options has been ruled out (the book being on the table), we can conclude that the other option must be true: the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
