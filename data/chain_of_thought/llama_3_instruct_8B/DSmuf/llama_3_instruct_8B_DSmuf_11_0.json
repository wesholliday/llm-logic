We have two statements:\n\t* Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch (\u00acP)\n2. From E, we can infer that either P (newspaper is on the porch) or Q (newspaper is in the driveway). We don't know which one is true.\n3. From \u00acP, we can conclude that P is false. This means that the newspaper cannot be sitting on the porch.\n4. Since P is false, we can infer that Q must be true. This is because E states that either P or Q is true, and we've eliminated P as an option.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
