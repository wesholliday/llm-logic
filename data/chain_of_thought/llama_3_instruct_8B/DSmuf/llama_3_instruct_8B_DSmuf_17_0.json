We have two statements:\n\t* Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n\t* It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack (since it's not the case).\n\n2. Since the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack, and either it must be draped on the coat rack or stuffed in my backpack, we can conclude that:\n\t* The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
