We have two statements:\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (conditional statement)\n\t* The truck was blue (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue.\n3. Now, we know from the factual statement that the truck is actually blue.\n4. Since the truck being blue is a consequence of the car being red (from the conditional statement), and we already know the truck is blue, it means that the condition \"the car was red\" must have been true for the truck to be blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
