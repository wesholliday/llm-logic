From statement 2, we know that the pants are indeed denim.\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about the relationship between the shirt and the pants if the shirt is cotton.\n4. Since we already know from statement 2 that the pants are denim, this doesn't give us any new information about the shirt being cotton or not.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether the shirt was cotton or not based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
