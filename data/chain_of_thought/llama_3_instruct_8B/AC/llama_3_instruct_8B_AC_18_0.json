From statement (2), we know that the truck is indeed metal.\n3. Now, let's look at statement (1). It says \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true.\n4. Since we don't have any information about the doll being plastic or not, we can't conclude that the doll is indeed plastic just because the truck is metal.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: no",
