The first premise is an if-then statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n3. We know that Erin took a train from the second premise.\n4. However, we don't have any information about whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nFrom these premises alone, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane. The first premise only tells us what happens if Sam takes a plane, but it doesn't tell us whether Sam actually took a plane or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
