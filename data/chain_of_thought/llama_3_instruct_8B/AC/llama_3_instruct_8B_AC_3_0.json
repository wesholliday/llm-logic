We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* The book is a mystery novel (fact)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. Now, we have the fact that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\n4. Since the book being a mystery novel is true, and it's also implied to be true only if it was written by James (from the conditional statement), we can conclude that:\n\n\t* The book must have been written by James, since it meets the condition of being a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
