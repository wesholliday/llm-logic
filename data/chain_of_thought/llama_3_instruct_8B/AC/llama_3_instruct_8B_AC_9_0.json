We have two statements:\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (conditional statement)\n\t* Mark bought the blue shirt (factual statement)\n2. From the second statement, we know that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt.\n3. Now, let's look at the conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This means that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, it would imply that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n4. However, we don't have any information about what Lisa actually did. We only know that Mark bought the blue shirt, but not whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nSince we can't conclude for certain whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not, based on the given statements, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
