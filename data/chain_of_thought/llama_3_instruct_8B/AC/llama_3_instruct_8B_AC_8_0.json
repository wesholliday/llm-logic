We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The mummy was awake (additional information)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\n3. Now, let's focus on the conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". This means that if the vampire were to be awake, it would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the mummy is also awake.\n\n4. Since we already know that the mummy is awake (from the second statement), this implies that the condition in the conditional statement has been met: the vampire being awake would indeed result in the mummy being awake.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that if the mummy is awake, it's likely because the vampire was also awake. This allows us to make an inference about the vampire's state:\n\nAnswer: yes",
