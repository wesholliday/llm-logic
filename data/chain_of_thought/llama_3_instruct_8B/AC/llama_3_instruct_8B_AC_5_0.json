The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that Amy did play tennis.\n4. Since we know Amy played tennis, and the first statement says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis, it's possible that Jeff played basketball.\n5. However, we can't conclude for certain that Jeff played basketball because there might be other reasons why Amy played tennis (e.g., she played with someone else).\n\nAnswer: no",
