We have two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (conditional statement)\n\t* Chris finished the race (conclusion)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if a certain condition is met (Alex finishing the race), then another event will occur (Chris finishing the race).\n\n3. Since we have evidence that Chris finished the race (from the conclusion), we can infer that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" must be true.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the conditional statement and the given information, we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
