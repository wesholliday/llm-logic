The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n3. However, we don't know whether Tom actually watched football or not. We only know that Jen watched basketball.\n4. Since we don't have any additional information about Tom's actions, we cannot conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
