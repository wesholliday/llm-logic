The statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility that Alex might have finished the race, but it also doesn't guarantee it.\n3. Since the statement only negates the necessity of finishing the race, we can infer that there is a chance (though not necessarily equal to 0) that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"Alex might not have finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
