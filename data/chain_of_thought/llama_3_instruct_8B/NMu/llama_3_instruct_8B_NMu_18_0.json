This statement does not imply that the notebook cannot be in the drawer, only that it's not a requirement for it to be there.\n3. The statement also doesn't imply that the notebook definitely is not in the drawer; it simply removes the necessity condition.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer, as there is no guarantee or necessity for it to be there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
