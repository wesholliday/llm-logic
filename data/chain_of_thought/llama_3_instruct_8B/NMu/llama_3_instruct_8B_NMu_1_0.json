This statement does not imply that Mary was definitely not at the wedding. It only rules out the possibility of necessity, but leaves open the possibility of possibility or probability.\n\n3. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies a degree of uncertainty about whether Mary attended the wedding. The phrase \"might not\" indicates a lack of certainty, which is different from the statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\".\n\n4. Since the original statement only rules out necessity, it does not provide enough information to infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
