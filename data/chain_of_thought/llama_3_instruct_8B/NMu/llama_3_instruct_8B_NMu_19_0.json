This statement does not imply that the watch cannot be charging on the dresser, only that it's not necessary for it to be charging there.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser because the statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the watch being charged elsewhere or not being charged at all.\n\nAnswer: yes",
