This statement does not imply that the jacket cannot be draped over the chair at all. It only says that it's not necessary, but it doesn't rule out the possibility entirely.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" because there is no guarantee that it will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
