This statement does not imply that the griffin might be in the forest, only that its presence is not necessary.\n\nHowever, this statement also doesn't imply that the griffin cannot be in the forest. It simply denies the necessity of its presence, leaving open the possibility that it might or might not be there.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" because the original statement only rules out the necessity of its presence, but doesn't rule out the possibility altogether.\n\nAnswer: yes",
