The statement does not imply that Jeff definitely didn't play basketball, only that it's possible he didn't.\n3. \"Might not have played basketball\" implies a degree of uncertainty or possibility about whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nGiven the original statement, we can infer that there is at least one possibility where Jeff did not play basketball (from point 1). This means that it is indeed possible that Jeff might not have played basketball (point 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
