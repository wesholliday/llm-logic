This statement is a negation of a necessity claim (\"must\"). It implies that the pen's presence or absence in my bag is not determined by any logical or physical necessity.\n3. From this, we can infer that the pen might not be in my bag because the statement doesn't rule out the possibility of it being elsewhere.\n\nAnswer: yes",
