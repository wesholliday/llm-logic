This statement does not imply that the alien did not visit Mars, only that there is no logical requirement for them to have done so.\n3. The statement also does not imply that the alien might have visited Mars; it simply doesn't provide any information about their potential actions.\n4. However, we can infer that the possibility of the alien visiting Mars is still open, since the original statement only ruled out the necessity of a visit.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
