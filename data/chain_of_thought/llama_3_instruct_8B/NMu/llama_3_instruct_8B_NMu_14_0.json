This statement does not imply that the milk cannot be on the counter, only that it's not required to be there.\n3. The statement also doesn't imply that the milk will definitely not be on the counter; it simply says that it's not necessary for it to be there.\n4. However, since it's not necessary for the milk to be on the counter, it's possible (or at least not ruled out) that the milk might not be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be on the counter\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
