Let's analyze:\n\n* If the glip was slogged (P), then it would imply that the glip must have tragged (Q) according to statement 1.\n* However, we know that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged (negation of Q).\n* This means that P (the glip was slogged) cannot be true, since if it were true, Q would also be true, but we know Q is false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The glip was not slogged\" (not-P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
