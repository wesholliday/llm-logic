It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the fribble was snurgled, it implies that the fribble must have crinked. This is a conditional statement, where \"snurgled\" is the antecedent and \"must have crinked\" is the consequent.\n\nStatement (2) says that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the negation of the consequent in statement (1) is true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about the antecedent \"the fribble was snurgled\". We can use a technique called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement and its consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nIn our case, the consequent \"must have crinked\" is false (according to statement 2), so using modus tollens, we can conclude that the antecedent \"the fribble was snurgled\" is also false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
