To do this, we need to use the given statements and some logical rules.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged (Vreebled \u2192 Plagged).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged (~Plagged).\n\nUsing the law of contrapositive, we can rewrite the original conditional statement as \"If the smonk did not plagge, then it was not vreebled\" (\u00acPlagged \u2192 \u00acVreebled). This is equivalent to saying that if the smonk did not plagge, then it's not the case that it was vreebled.\n\nNow we can combine this with statement 2: since it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged (~Plagged), we know that the smonk did not plagge (\u00acPlagged).\n\nUsing the rewritten conditional statement, we can conclude that if the smonk did not plagge, then it was not vreebled (\u00acPlagged \u2192 \u00acVreebled). This is equivalent to saying that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
