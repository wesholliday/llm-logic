We are given two statements:\n\t* If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\t* It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n\n2. The second statement is negating the possibility of the whiffle having tinked. This means that it's possible that the whiffle didn't tinker.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked. This is a conditional statement, and if the antecedent (the whiffle being shanked) is false, the consequent (the whiffle having tinked) doesn't necessarily follow.\n\n4. Since we know that it's possible that the whiffle didn't tinker (from the second statement), and the first statement only talks about what happens if the whiffle was shanked, we can't conclude that the whiffle wasn't shanked just because it didn't tinker.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that the whiffle was not shanked from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
