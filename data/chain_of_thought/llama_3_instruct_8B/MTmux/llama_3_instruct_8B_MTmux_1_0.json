It does not directly relate to the blimmed condition, but it implies that the consequent (zargling) is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the flugel was indeed blimmed, then according to the first statement, it must have been zargled. However, we know from the second statement that this is not the case (it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled). This means that the antecedent (the flugel being blimmed) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
