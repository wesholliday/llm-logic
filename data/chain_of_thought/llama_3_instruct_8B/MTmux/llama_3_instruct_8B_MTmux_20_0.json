It implies that the fleeg did not necessarily have to be surned.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these statements:\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. But statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nThis means that the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is not necessarily true. In other words, we cannot conclude that the fleeg was bluttered just because it might have been surned.\n\nHowever, we can use modus tollens (a logical rule) to infer that if the conclusion (\"it must have been surned\") is false, then the premise (\"the fleeg was bluttered\") must also be false. In this case, since \"it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned\" is true, we can conclude that \"the fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
