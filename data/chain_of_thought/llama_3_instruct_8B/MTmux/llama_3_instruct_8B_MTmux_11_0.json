This implies that being blummed is a sufficient condition for being zimmed.\n3. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed\".\n4. This implies that it is not necessary for the flug to be zimmed.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the flug was blummed:\n\n* If the flug was blummed, then it would be sufficient for it to be zimmed (by the original statement).\n* But we know that it's not necessary for the flug to be zimmed (from the second statement).\n* Therefore, if the flug was blummed, it wouldn't necessarily have to bezimmed.\n* This means that being blummed is not a sufficient condition for being zimmed.\n\nSince the original statement implied that being blummed is a sufficient condition for being zimmed, and we've just shown that this is not the case, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: no",
