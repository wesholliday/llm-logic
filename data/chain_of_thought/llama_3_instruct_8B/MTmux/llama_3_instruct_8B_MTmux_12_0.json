It means that it is not true that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from these statements:\n\nIf we assume that the smip was shripped (antecedent), then according to statement 1, the smip must have lupped the zoint. But this is contradicted by statement 2, which says that it's not true that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nThis means that our initial assumption (\"the smip was shripped\") cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
