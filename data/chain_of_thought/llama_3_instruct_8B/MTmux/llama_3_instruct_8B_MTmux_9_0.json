We are given two statements:\n\t* If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished (this is a conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished (this is a negation of the conclusion in the first statement)\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that the twonk does not necessarily have to be varnished.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This means that if the twonk is plinked, it will definitely be varnished.\n\n4. Since we know that the twonk does not necessarily have to be varnished (from the second statement), and the first statement says that if it's plinked, it must be varnished, this means that the twonk cannot have been plinked.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that The twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
