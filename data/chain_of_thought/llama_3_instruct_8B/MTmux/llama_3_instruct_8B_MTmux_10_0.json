It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can infer that if the wug was sproinged, then it is necessarily garpled. This implies that being sproinged entails being garpled.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled. This means that the wug might not be garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"The wug was not sproinged\". To infer this from the given statements, we would need to show that if the wug is not garpled, then it cannot be sproinged.\n\nHowever, statement (1) only tells us that being sproinged entails being garpled, but it doesn't imply that being non-garpled implies being non-sproinged. In other words, there might be a possibility where the wug is not garpled but still sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The wug was not sproinged\" solely based on statements (1) and (2).\n\nAnswer: no",
