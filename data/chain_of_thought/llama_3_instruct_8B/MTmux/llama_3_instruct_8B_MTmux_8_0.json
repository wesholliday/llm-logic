It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the sprocket was cranked, it implies that the sprocket was daggled. This is a conditional statement, where \"cranked\" is the antecedent and \"daggled\" is the consequent.\n\nStatement (2) says that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that the sprocket might or might not have been daggled, but we can't conclude anything about its cranking status.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from these statements:\n\n* If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled (from statement 1).\n* But it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled (from statement 2).\n\nFrom this, we can't conclude anything about the sprocket being cranked or not. The statements only provide information about the relationship between \"cranked\" and \"daggled\", but not about the sprocket's actual state.\n\nAnswer: no",
