We are given two statements:\n\t* If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the clug is fleeked, it must be snugged.\n3. The second statement says that it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This means that the clug cannot be both fleeked and snugged at the same time.\n4. Since the clug cannot be both fleeked and snugged, we can conclude that if the clug is not snugged, then it's not fleeked either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
