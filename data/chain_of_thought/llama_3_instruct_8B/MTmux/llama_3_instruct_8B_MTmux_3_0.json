We are given two statements:\n\t* If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that the splat must have quanked (negation of a statement)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, it would not have to quank.\n3. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the splat must have quanked. This means that the splat does not have to quank.\n\n4. Now, let's combine steps 2 and 3: if the splat was not morphed, it would not have to quank, but since it doesn't have to quank anyway (from step 3), we can conclude that the splat is not morphed.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that The splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
