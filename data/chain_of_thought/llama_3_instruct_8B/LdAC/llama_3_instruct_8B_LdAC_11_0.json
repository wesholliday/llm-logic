From statement (2), we can conclude that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n\n3. However, this conclusion does not provide any information about the cake's flavor. We only know something about the muffins.\n\n4. Statement (1) is a conditional statement, which means it provides a relationship between two events: the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. But it doesn't say that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"The cake was chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
