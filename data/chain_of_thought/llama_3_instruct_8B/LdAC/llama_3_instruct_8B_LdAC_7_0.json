We have two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (conditional statement)\n\t* Chris finished the race (conclusion)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if a certain condition is met (Alex finishing the race), then another event will occur (Chris finishing the race).\n\n3. Since we have evidence that Chris finished the race (from the conclusion), we can infer that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" must be true.\n\n4. This is because the conditional statement states that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris will finish the race. If Chris has indeed finished the race, it means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" must have been met for Chris to finish the race.\n\n5. Therefore, we can logically deduce that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
