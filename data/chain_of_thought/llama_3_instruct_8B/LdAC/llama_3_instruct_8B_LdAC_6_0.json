We have two statements:\n\t* If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (conditional statement)\n\t* Bob chose pasta (factual statement)\n2. From the factual statement \"Bob chose pasta\", we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement is true, i.e., Bob did choose pasta.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply modus ponens to infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nHowever, there's a catch! The original conditional statement only guarantees that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. It doesn't guarantee that Sue actually chose pizza. We don't have any information about Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Sue chose pizza\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
