From the second premise, we know that Erin did take a train.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the first premise: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\". This is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\n4. However, we don't know whether Sam actually took a plane or not. We only know that Erin took a train.\n\n5. Since we don't have enough information to conclude that Sam took a plane, we cannot logically deduce \"Sam took a plane\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
