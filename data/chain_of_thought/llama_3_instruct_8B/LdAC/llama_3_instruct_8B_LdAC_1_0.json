We have two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Sue was at the wedding (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if Mary was indeed at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n3. However, the factual statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
