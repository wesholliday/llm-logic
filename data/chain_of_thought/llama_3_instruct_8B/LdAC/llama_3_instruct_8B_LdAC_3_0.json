We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* The book is a mystery novel (fact)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. Now, we have the fact that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\n4. Since the book is a mystery novel, and from step 2, we know that if it was written by James, it would be a mystery novel, we can conclude that:\n\n\t* The book being a mystery novel implies that it might have been written by James (but not necessarily)\n\n5. However, we cannot logically deduce that the book was actually written by James from these two statements alone.\n\n6. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels as well, so we can't make a definitive conclusion about the authorship of the book based on this information.\n\nAnswer: no",
