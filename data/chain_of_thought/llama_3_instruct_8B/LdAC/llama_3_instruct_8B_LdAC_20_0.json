We have two statements:\n\t* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (conditional statement)\n\t* The banana was yellow (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow.\n3. However, the factual statement \"The banana was yellow\" does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"The apple was red\" from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
