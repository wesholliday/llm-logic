This statement implies a causal relationship between the vampire and the mummy being awake.\n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must be awake as well.\n\nFor example, it's possible that there are other factors at play that affect the vampire's wakefulness, unrelated to the mummy's state. Similarly, it's possible that the mummy's wakefulness is independent of the vampire's.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" solely from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
