This statement implies that when the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.\n3. However, this does not imply that when the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\nThe original statement only provides a conditional relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location in one direction (dog inside \u2192 cat outside). It does not provide any information about the reverse direction (cat outside \u2192 dog inside).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
