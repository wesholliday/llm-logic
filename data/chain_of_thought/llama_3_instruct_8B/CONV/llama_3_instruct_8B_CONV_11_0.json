This statement implies that there is a relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins.\n3. However, this statement does not imply that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n\nThe reason for this is that there could be other possibilities where the muffins are blueberry but the cake is not chocolate. For example, the cake could be vanilla or strawberry, and still have blueberry muffins.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
