This implies that there is a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n2. We want to infer the converse statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\".\n3. To do this, we need to check if the original statement's antecedent (Sam taking a plane) can be swapped with its consequent (Erin taking a train).\n4. However, swapping the antecedent and consequent would change the meaning of the original statement.\n5. The original statement implies that Sam's action (taking a plane) causes Erin to take a train. Swapping the antecedent and consequent would imply that Erin's action (taking a train) causes Sam to take a plane, which is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
