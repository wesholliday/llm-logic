This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n2. We want to know if we can infer the reverse: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\".\n3. To determine this, let's analyze the original statement again. The condition (\"the doll was plastic\") is not necessarily related to the consequence (\"the truck was metal\") in a way that would allow us to make an inference about the converse.\n4. In other words, just because the truck being metal follows from the doll being plastic, it doesn't mean that the doll being plastic follows from the truck being metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the reverse statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
