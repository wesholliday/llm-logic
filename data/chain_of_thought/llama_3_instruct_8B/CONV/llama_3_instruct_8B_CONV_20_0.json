This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer a new statement: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\". This is also a conditional statement.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer this new statement from the original one, let's analyze the relationship between the antecedent and consequent in both statements:\n\n* In the original statement, if the apple is red (antecedent), then the banana must be yellow (consequent).\n* In the inferred statement, if the banana is yellow (antecedent), we want to conclude that the apple must be red (consequent).\n\nNotice that the antecedents and consequents are swapped between the two statements. This means that the relationship between them is not symmetric.\n\nIn particular, just because the banana being yellow implies the apple being red in the original statement, it doesn't mean that the apple being red implies the banana being yellow in the inferred statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
