This implies that there is a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. We want to know if we can infer the converse statement: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n3. To determine this, let's analyze the given statement again. It says that when Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark buys the blue shirt. This implies a causal relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n4. However, we cannot directly infer that when Mark buys the blue shirt, Lisa must have bought the red shirt. The original statement only establishes a connection in one direction (Lisa -> Mark), not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
