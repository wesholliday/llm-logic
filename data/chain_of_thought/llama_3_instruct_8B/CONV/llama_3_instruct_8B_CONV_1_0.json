            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) implies the consequent (Sue being at the wedding).\n2. To infer the converse of this statement, we need to swap the antecedent and consequent: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\".\n3. However, simply swapping the antecedent and consequent does not guarantee that the resulting statement is true.\n4. In fact, there might be other factors or conditions that affect whether Mary or Sue attended the wedding. For example, maybe only women who wore red dresses were allowed to attend, and Mary didn't wear a red dress but Sue did.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
