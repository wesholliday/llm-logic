This implies that there is a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the pants are denim, then the shirt must be cotton.\n\nThe reason for this is that the original statement only provides information about the shirt's material (cotton) causing the pants to be denim, but it doesn't provide any information about the pants' material (denim) causing the shirt to be cotton. The relationship is one-way, not two-way.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
