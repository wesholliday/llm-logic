This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) implies the consequent (Chris finishing the race).\n2. We want to know if we can infer the converse of this statement, which would be \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\".\n3. To determine if we can make this inference, let's consider a scenario where both statements are true:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (given statement)\n\t* If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race (converse of the given statement)\n\nIn this scenario, if Alex finished the race and Chris also finished the race, we can conclude that the converse is indeed true. However, there might be scenarios where only one of them finishes the race.\n\n4. The problem is that the original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when only one of them finishes the race. It only guarantees that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish it.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse with certainty. There might be cases where Chris finishes the race but Alex doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
