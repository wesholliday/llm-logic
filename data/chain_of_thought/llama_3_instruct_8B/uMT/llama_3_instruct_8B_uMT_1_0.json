It suggests that if Mary is present at the wedding, Sue will also be present.\n2. However, the second statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" contradicts the first statement. This means that the condition in the first statement (Mary being at the wedding) cannot be true.\n3. Since the condition cannot be true, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
