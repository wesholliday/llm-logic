The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n2. However, the second statement \"Bob did not choose pasta\" contradicts the implication in step 1.\n\nSince Bob didn't choose pasta, we can conclude that the initial condition \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is not true.\n\nThis means that Sue might have chosen something other than pizza, and we cannot infer with certainty whether she chose pizza or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
