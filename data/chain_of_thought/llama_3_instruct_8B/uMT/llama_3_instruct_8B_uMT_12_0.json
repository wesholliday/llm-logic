The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. However, we are given additional information that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\".\n3. Since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it means that the condition \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is not satisfied.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nNow, let's examine the original question: Can we infer that Joe did not go to the park?\n\nSince we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park from the given information, it means that we also cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park. The possibility of Joe going to the park remains open.\n\nAnswer: no",
