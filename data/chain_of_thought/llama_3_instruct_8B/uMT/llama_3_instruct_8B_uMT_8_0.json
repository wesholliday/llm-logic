            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies a conditional relationship between the two statements. This means that if the vampire is awake, we can conclude that the mummy is also awake.\n2. However, the second statement \"the mummy was not awake\" contradicts the first implication. If the mummy is not awake, then it cannot be true that the mummy is awake when the vampire is awake (since this would require the mummy to be both awake and not awake at the same time).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the initial assumption \"if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" must be false. This means that it's possible for the vampire to be awake without the mummy being awake.\n4. Since the mummy is not awake, and the initial assumption implies a relationship between the two, we can infer that the vampire might also not be awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
