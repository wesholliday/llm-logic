It suggests that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish the race.\n2. However, we are given additional information: \"Chris did not finish the race\". This means that the condition in step 1 is not met, since Chris did not finish the race even though Alex might have finished it.\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race based on the original statement.\n\nNow, let's examine the opposite scenario: if Alex did not finish the race. In this case, the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" would still be false, since Chris did not finish the race regardless of whether Alex finished it or not.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
