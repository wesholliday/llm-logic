The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"the truck was not blue\".\n3. From this, we can conclude that the truck's color is actually something other than blue (since it's explicitly stated that it's not blue).\n4. Now, let's consider the original conditional statement: if the car was red, then the truck would be blue.\n5. Since the truck is not blue, it means that the condition \"the car was red\" must not have been true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
