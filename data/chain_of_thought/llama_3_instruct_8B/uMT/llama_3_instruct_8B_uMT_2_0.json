            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" implies that there is a relationship between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn.\n2. The second statement \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" tells us that the unicorn's presence is actually absent.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest (from step 1).\n* But we know that the unicorn is not in the forest (from step 2).\n\nThis means that the first condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" cannot be true, because if it were, the second condition \"the unicorn was in the forest\" would also have to be true, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
