The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim.\n2. However, we are given additional information that the pants were not denim.\n3. Since the pants cannot be both denim (according to the original statement) and not denim (according to the new information), we can conclude that the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is actually false.\n\nThis means that it's possible for the shirt to be cotton even though the pants are not denim. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
