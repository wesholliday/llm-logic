The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the author and the genre of the book.\n2. We are given two contradictory statements:\n\t* \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\t* \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n3.
