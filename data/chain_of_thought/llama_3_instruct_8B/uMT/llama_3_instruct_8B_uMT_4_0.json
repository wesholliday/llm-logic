The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the first statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is actually false.\n\nSince the robot did not visit Jupiter, it's possible that the alien also didn't visit Mars. We can't conclude for certain without more information, but we can infer that the possibility of the alien visiting Mars is reduced.\n\nAnswer: yes",
