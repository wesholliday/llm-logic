The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies a conditional relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location.\n2. We are given that \"the cat was not outside\". This means that the condition in the first statement is not true (i.e., the dog is not inside).\n3. Since the condition is not true, we can conclude that the dog must be outside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
