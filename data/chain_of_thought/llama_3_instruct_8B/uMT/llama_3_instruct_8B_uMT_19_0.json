            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n2. However, the second part of the statement \"Jen did not watch basketball\" contradicts the implication in step 1, as it states that Jen did not watch basketball even if Tom watched football.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football, because if he had, Jen would have watched basketball according to the original conditional relationship. But since Jen didn't watch basketball, it's unlikely that Tom watched football in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes",
