The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" implies that there is a relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n2. However, we are also given the information that \"the wolf was not in the den\". This means that the condition of the wolf being in the den is not met.\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that the bear is necessarily in the cave. The original statement only implies a relationship between the two, but it does not guarantee that the bear will be in the cave if the wolf is not in the den.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave. We can only conclude that there is no direct evidence to support or refute the presence of the bear in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
