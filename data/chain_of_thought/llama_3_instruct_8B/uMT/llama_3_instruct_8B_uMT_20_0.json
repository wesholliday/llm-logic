The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n2. We are given additional information that \"the banana was not yellow\". This means that the condition in the original statement is not met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the apple were red, then the banana would be yellow (according to the original statement).\n* However, we know that the banana is not yellow.\n* Therefore, it cannot be the case that the apple is red.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
