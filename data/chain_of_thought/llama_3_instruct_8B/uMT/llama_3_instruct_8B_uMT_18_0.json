The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the properties of the doll and the truck.\n2. Since the truck is not metal (given information), we can conclude that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" must be false.\n3. If the doll were indeed plastic, the truck would have to be metal according to the original statement. But since it's not metal, this means the doll cannot be plastic.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
