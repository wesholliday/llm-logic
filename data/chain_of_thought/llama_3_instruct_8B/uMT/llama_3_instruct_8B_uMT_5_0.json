It doesn't mean that if Amy didn't play tennis, Jeff didn't play basketball.\n2. We are given another statement: \"Amy did not play tennis\". This means we can conclude that Amy didn't play tennis, but it doesn't provide any information about Jeff's activity.\n3. Since we don't have any additional information about Jeff's activity, we cannot infer that Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
