The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. This means that if we know Joe went to the park, we can conclude with certainty that Lucy went to the zoo.\n3. However, this does not mean that if we know Lucy went to the zoo, we can conclude with certainty that Joe went to the park.\n\nThe original statement only provides a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo in one direction (if-then). It does not provide any information about the reverse direction (then-if).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
