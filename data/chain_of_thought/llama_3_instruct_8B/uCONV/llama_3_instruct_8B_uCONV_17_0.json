The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n2. This implies that Ben eating pasta is the condition (or antecedent) for Kate eating salad to occur.\n3. However, this does not imply that Kate eating salad is the condition for Ben eating pasta to occur.\n\nIn other words, just because Kate ate salad, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta. The original statement only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not establish a reciprocal relationship.\n\nAnswer: no",
