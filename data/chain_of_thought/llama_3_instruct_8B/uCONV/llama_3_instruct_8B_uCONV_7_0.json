The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies that there is a relationship between Alex and Chris's finishing the race.\n2. This relationship can be represented as an if-then statement: If (Alex finishes the race), Then (Chris finishes the race).\n3. This means that whenever Alex finishes the race, Chris also finishes the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse scenario:\n\n\"If Chris finished the race, then...?\"\n\nWe don't have any information about what happens when Chris finishes the race. We only know that if Alex finishes the race, Chris also finishes the race. There is no guarantee that if Chris finishes the race, Alex will finish it as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
