This means that if Jeff plays basketball, it is likely to trigger Amy playing tennis (or vice versa).\n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Amy plays tennis, Jeff will play basketball.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the correlation between Jeff's basketball and Amy's tennis, but it doesn't establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship in the reverse direction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
