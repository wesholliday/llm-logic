This means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n3. However, this does not mean that if the consequent (the banana being yellow) is true, then the antecedent (the apple being red) must also be true.\n\nThe original statement only establishes a relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color in one direction: from the apple's color to the banana's color. It does not establish a relationship in the other direction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
