The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. This implies that there is some kind of correlation or association between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n3. However, this does not imply a bi-directional relationship, meaning we cannot conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThe original statement only establishes a connection in one direction (Lisa -> Mark), but it does not provide any information about the reverse direction (Mark -> Lisa).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
