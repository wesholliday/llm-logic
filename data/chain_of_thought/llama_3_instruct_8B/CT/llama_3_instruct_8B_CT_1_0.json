This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer the converse of this statement: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement as well.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this converse, let's consider the following:\n\n* If Sue was not at the wedding, it means that the condition in the original statement (\"Mary was at the wedding\") cannot be true. Otherwise, Sue would have been at the wedding.\n* Since the condition is false, the consequence (\"Sue was at the wedding\") must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
