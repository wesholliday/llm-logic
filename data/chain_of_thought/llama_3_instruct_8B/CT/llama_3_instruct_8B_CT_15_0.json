This implies that there is a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n2. We want to infer the statement \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\".\n3. To do this, we need to find out if the original statement provides any information about what happens when Erin does not take a train.\n\nFrom the original statement, we can see that it only talks about the relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when Erin does not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the relationship between Erin not taking a train and Sam not taking a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
