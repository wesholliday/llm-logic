This is a conditional statement, where if the antecedent (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate eating the salad) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer another statement: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\".\n3. To do this, we need to find a connection between the two statements. Since the original statement says that if Ben eats pasta, Kate eats the salad, it implies that if Kate does not eat the salad, it must be because Ben did not eat pasta.\n4. This is because if Ben ate pasta, Kate would have eaten the salad according to the original statement. But since Kate did not eat the salad, it means Ben did not eat pasta either (otherwise, Kate would have eaten the salad).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
