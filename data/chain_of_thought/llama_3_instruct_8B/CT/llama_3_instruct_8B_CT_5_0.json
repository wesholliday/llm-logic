This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) implies the consequent (Amy playing tennis).\n2. We want to infer the converse of this statement: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\".\n3. To do this, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement.\n4. Negating the antecedent (\"Jeff played basketball\") gives us \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n5. Negating the consequent (\"Amy played tennis\") gives us \"Amy did not play tennis\".\n6. Now, we can construct the converse statement: \"If Amy did not play tennis (consequent), then Jeff did not play basketball (antecedent)\".\n7. This converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
