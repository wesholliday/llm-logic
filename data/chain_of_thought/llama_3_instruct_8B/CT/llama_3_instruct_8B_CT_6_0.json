This implies that there is a direct relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n2. We want to infer the statement \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n3. To do this, we need to find out if the original statement can be reversed or flipped.\n\nNotice that the original statement has an \"if-then\" structure, which means it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. However, when we try to flip the statement, we get:\n\n\"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\"\n\nThis new statement is actually the converse of the original statement, not its inverse.\n\nThe converse of an \"if-then\" statement is true only if the original statement is a biconditional (i.e., both statements are equivalent). In this case, we don't have enough information to conclude that the original statement is a biconditional. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
