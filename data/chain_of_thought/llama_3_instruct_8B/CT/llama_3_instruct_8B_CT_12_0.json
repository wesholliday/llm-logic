However, it does not imply that if Lucy doesn't go to the zoo, then Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nTo infer the converse of the original statement (\"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"), we would need additional information or a stronger connection between the two events. The given statement only provides a positive correlation between Joe's visit to the park and Lucy's visit to the zoo, but it does not provide any evidence for the converse.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
