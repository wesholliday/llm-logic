This implies that when the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\".\n4. We can rephrase this as \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" (using the contrapositive).\n5. Since we know that when the dog is inside, the cat must be outside (from step 2), it follows that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
