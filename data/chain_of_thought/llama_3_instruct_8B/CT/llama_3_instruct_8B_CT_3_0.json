This implies that there is a direct relationship between the author (James) and the genre of the book (mystery novel).\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\"\n4. To infer this converse statement from the original statement, we need to show that if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot be written by James.\n5. From the original statement, we know that if the book is written by James, it must be a mystery novel (by definition).\n6. Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James (since James only writes mystery novels).\n\nAnswer: yes",
