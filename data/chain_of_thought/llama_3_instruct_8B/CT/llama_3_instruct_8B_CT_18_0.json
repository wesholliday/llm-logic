This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer a new statement: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n3. To do this, we need to reverse the original statement and see if it still holds true.\n\nReversing the original statement gives us: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n\nThis new statement is actually a logical consequence of the original statement! If the condition (the truck being not metal) is true, then the consequence (the doll being not plastic) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
