This implies that there is a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n2. We want to infer the converse of this statement, which would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n3. To do this, we need to see if the original statement provides any information about what happens when Jen does not watch basketball.\n\nThe original statement only talks about what happens when Tom watches football (which implies that Jen watches basketball). It doesn't provide any information about what happens when Jen does not watch basketball.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the original statement with certainty. There might be other scenarios where Jen does not watch basketball, but it's not necessarily related to Tom watching or not watching football.\n\nAnswer: no",
