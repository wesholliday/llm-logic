This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer a new statement: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\".\n3. To do this, we need to find a logical connection between the original statement and the new statement.\n\nNotice that the original statement is saying that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. This implies that if the truck is NOT blue, then it cannot be the case that the car is red (because the truck being blue is a necessary condition for the car to be red).\n\nSo, we can conclude that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
