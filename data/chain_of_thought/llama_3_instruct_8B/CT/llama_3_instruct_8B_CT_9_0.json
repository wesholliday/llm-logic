This implies that there is a correlation between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. We want to infer the converse: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n3. To do this, we need to consider the possibility of both statements being true or false.\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt (true) and Mark bought the blue shirt (true), then the original statement is satisfied.\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt (true) but Mark did not buy the blue shirt (false), then the original statement is violated. This means that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, it's possible that Lisa still bought the red shirt.\n\nOn the other hand, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (false), then the original statement is also satisfied regardless of whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". There are scenarios where this converse does not hold true.\n\nAnswer: no",
