This is a conditional statement, where if the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer the converse of this statement: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\". This would mean that if Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex also didn't finish the race.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer this converse from the original statement. The original statement only tells us that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris also finishes the race. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when Chris doesn't finish the race.\n\nIn other words, just because Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race, it doesn't mean that Alex not finishing the race is dependent on Chris not finishing the race. There could be scenarios where Alex doesn't finish the race but Chris still finishes, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
