The statement says \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\"\nThis means that there are only two possible locations for the shoes: the closet and the area by the door.\n2. The statement also says \"Also, the shoes aren't lined up by the door.\"\nThis means that we can eliminate one of the possibilities: the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nSince there are only two possible locations for the shoes (the closet and the area by the door), and we've eliminated the area by the door as a possibility, it follows logically that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
