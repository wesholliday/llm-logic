The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. This doesn't necessarily mean it's in the living room, as there could be other possibilities (e.g., the phone is off, or it's ringing somewhere else).\n\nHowever, combining this information with the initial statement (1), we can infer that if the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, then it must be ringing in the living room. This is because the only alternative option mentioned is the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
