The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist\" sets up a binary situation, where one of these two options must be true.\n2. We are given additional information that \"the watch isn't on his wrist\". This means we can eliminate the second option (watch being on his wrist) from consideration.\n\nGiven this new information, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser. Since one of the two options must be true, and the other has been eliminated, it's logical to infer that the watch is indeed charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
