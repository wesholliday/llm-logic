            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (conditional statement)\n\t* Lisa did not buy the red shirt (fact)\n\n2. From the fact that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement is false (i.e., Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\n3. Since the condition is false, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt from the original conditional statement.\n\n4. However, we cannot directly conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt either, because there might be other possibilities where Mark still buys the blue shirt (e.g., Lisa never intended to buy the red shirt in the first place).\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
