We have two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Mary was not at the wedding (fact)\n\n2. From the fact \"Mary was not at the wedding\", we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"Mary was at the wedding\") is false.\n\n3. Since the antecedent is false, we cannot apply the conditional statement to infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Sue was or wasn't at the wedding based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
