We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The vampire was not awake (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy must be awake (since the condition is reversed).\n3. However, this does not directly imply that the mummy is not awake.\n4. To conclude that the mummy is not awake, we would need an additional statement or assumption that links the vampire's wakefulness to the mummy's wakefulness in both directions.\n\nSince we only have two statements and no additional information, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
