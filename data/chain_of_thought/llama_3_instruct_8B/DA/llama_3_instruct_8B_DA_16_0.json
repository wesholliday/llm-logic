From statement 2, we know that the shirt is not cotton.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement. If the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is false, then the consequent (the pants being denim) does not necessarily follow.\n\n4. Since we know that the shirt is not cotton (from statement 2), we cannot conclude that the pants are denim. The condition for the pants to be denim (\"the shirt was cotton\") is not met.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
