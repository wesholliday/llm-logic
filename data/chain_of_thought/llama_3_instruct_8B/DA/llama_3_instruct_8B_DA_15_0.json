We have two statements:\n\t* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (conditional statement)\n\t* Sam did not take a plane (factual statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sam didn't take a plane, then Erin might or might not have taken a train.\n3. The second statement tells us that Sam indeed did not take a plane.\n4. Since the conditional statement only provides a possibility for Erin's action (taking a train), it doesn't guarantee that she took a train.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
