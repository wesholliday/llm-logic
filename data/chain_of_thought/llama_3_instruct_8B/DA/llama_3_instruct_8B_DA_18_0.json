From statement 1, we can infer that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck cannot be metal (since the condition \"if the doll was plastic\" is not met).\n\n3. Statement 2 tells us that the doll is indeed not plastic.\n\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that since the doll is not plastic, the truck cannot be metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
