Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lucy went to the zoo because the consequence only applies when the condition is true.\n\nHowever, just because the condition is false, it doesn't mean that Lucy didn't go to the zoo at all. There's no direct connection between Joe not going to the park and Lucy not going to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
