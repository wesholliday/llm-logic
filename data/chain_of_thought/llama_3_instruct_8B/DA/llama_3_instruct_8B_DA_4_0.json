From statement 2, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (the alien visiting Mars) is false.\n\n3. Since the antecedent is false, we cannot apply the conditional statement to draw any conclusions about the robot's visit to Jupiter.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the robot visited Jupiter or not based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
