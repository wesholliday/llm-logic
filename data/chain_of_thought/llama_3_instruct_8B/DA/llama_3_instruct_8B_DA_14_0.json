We have two statements:\n\t* If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (conditional statement)\n\t* The bear was not in the cave (factual statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the bear is not in the cave, it doesn't necessarily mean the wolf is not in the den. The conditional statement only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den.\n3. However, since we know the bear was not in the cave (from the second statement), we can use this information to strengthen our conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
