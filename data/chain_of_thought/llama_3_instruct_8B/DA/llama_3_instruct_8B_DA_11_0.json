From statement 2, we know that the cake is not chocolate.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true.\n\n4. Since we've established that the cake is not chocolate (from statement 2), the condition in the first statement is false.\n\n5. Therefore, the conclusion \"The muffins were blueberry\" does not follow from the given statements.\n\n6. We cannot infer anything about the color of the muffins based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
