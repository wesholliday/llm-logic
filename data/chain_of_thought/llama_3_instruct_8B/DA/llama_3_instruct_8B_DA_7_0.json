We have two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (conditional statement)\n\t* Alex did not finish the race (fact)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if Alex didn't finish the race, Chris also didn't finish the race.\n\n3. Since Alex did not finish the race (second statement), we can apply the conclusion from step 2: Chris also did not finish the race.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
