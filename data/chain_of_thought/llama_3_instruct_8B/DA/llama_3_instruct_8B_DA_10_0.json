From statement 2, we can conclude that the dog is indeed outside (since it says \"not inside\").\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1 again: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". Since we've concluded that the dog is outside, this statement doesn't apply to our situation.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the cat being outside or not. The original statement only talks about the relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location when the dog is inside, but since the dog is actually outside, this information is irrelevant.\n\nAnswer: no",
