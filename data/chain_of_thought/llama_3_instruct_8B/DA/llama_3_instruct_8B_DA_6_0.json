From the first statement, we can conclude that if Sue didn't choose pizza, then Bob didn't choose pasta (since the condition is reversed).\n3. Since Sue did not choose pizza (given in the second statement), we can apply the conclusion from step 2: Bob didn't choose pasta.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
