We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\t* The book was not written by James.\n\n2. From statement 2, we know that the book was not written by James.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an if-then statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition (the book being written by James) is true, then another condition (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know from statement 2 that the book was not written by James, we can conclude that the condition \"the book was written by James\" is false.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot apply the if-then statement in step 3 to our situation, because the condition it's talking about (the book being written by James) is not true.\n\n6. Since we can't apply the if-then statement, we can't infer anything about whether the book is a mystery novel or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
