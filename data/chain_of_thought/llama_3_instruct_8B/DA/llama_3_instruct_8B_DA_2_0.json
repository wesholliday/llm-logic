We have two statements:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (conditional statement)\n\t* The griffin was not in the forest (factual statement)\n2. From the second statement, we know that the griffin is not in the forest.\n3. Since the conditional statement says \"if the griffin was in the forest\", it implies that if the griffin were indeed in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest.\n4. However, since we know from the factual statement that the griffin is not in the forest, we cannot conclude anything about the unicorn's presence or absence.\n\nThe key point here is that the conditional statement only provides information about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn when both are in the forest. Since the griffin is not in the forest, we cannot infer anything about the unicorn's presence or absence.\n\nAnswer: no",
