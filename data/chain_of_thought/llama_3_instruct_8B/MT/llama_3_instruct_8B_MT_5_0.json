From the first statement, we can infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must not have played tennis (since Amy didn't play tennis).\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement: Amy did not play tennis. This is consistent with our previous inference.\n4. Since Amy did not play tennis, it doesn't provide any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nAt this point, we can't conclude that Jeff did not play basketball. We only know that Amy didn't play tennis, but that's a separate issue from Jeff's basketball playing.\n\nAnswer: no",
