We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\t* The book is not a mystery novel.\n\n2. From statement 2, we know that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an if-then statement, which means that if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know from statement 2 that the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot be the case that the book was written by James (because if it were, then the book would be a mystery novel, which contradicts statement 2).\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
