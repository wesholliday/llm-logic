We have two statements:\n\t* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (conditional statement)\n\t* Erin did not take a train (factual statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, Erin would have taken a train.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that Erin did not take a train. This means that the condition \"Erin took a train\" is false.\n4. Since the condition is false, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane (because the conditional statement only talks about what happens if Sam takes a plane).\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
