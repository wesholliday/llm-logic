We have two statements:\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (conditional statement)\n\t* The truck was not blue (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue.\n3. However, the factual statement tells us that the truck is NOT blue.\n4. This means that the condition \"the truck is blue\" cannot be true.\n5. Since the condition \"the truck is blue\" is linked to the premise \"the car was red\", we can conclude that the premise \"the car was red\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
