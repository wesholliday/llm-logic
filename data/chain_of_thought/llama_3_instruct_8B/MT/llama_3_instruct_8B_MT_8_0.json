We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The mummy was not awake (factual statement)\n2. From the second statement, we know that the mummy is not awake.\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". This means that if the vampire were awake, it would imply that the mummy is also awake.\n4. However, we already know from the second statement that the mummy is not awake. Therefore, the condition in the first statement (the vampire being awake) cannot be true.\n5. Since the condition cannot be true, we cannot conclude anything about the vampire's state of wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no",
