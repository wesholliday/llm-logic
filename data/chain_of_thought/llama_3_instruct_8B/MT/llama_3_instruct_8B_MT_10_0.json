We have two statements:\n\t* If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\t* The cat was not outside.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that the cat must be inside (since it's not outside).\n\nNow, let's go back to statement 1: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement. If the antecedent (\"the dog was inside\") is true, then the consequent (\"the cat was outside\") must also be true.\n\nSince we've already concluded that the cat is inside (from statement 2), it means that the antecedent \"the dog was inside\" cannot be true. If the dog were indeed inside, the cat would have to be outside, which contradicts our conclusion from statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog must not be inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
