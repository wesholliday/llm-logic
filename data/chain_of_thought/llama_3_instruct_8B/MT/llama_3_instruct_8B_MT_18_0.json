From statement 2, we know that the truck is not metal.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement 1: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true.\n\n4. Since the condition is not met (the doll is not plastic), we cannot conclude that the truck is metal. The statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is false.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the doll's material from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
