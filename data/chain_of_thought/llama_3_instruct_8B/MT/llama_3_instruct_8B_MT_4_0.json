From statement 2, we can conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter (this is a direct conclusion).\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\". This is an if-then statement, which means that if the antecedent (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\n4. However, we know from step 2 that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the consequent of statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n5. Since the consequent of statement 1 cannot be true, it implies that the antecedent (the alien visiting Mars) cannot be true either. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, but since the robot did not visit Jupiter, the alien must not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
