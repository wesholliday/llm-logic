We have two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Sue was not at the wedding (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n3. However, the factual statement tells us that Sue was actually not at the wedding.\n4. Since Sue was not at the wedding, it means that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is not satisfied.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
