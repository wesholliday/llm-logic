From statement 2, we can conclude that the muffins are not blueberry.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is an if-then statement, which means that if the antecedent (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequent (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\n4. However, we know from step 2 that the muffins are not blueberry. This means that the consequent of statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent of statement 1 (the cake being chocolate) is also false.\n\n6. So, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
