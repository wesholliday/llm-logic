We have two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (conditional statement)\n\t* Chris did not finish the race (fact)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, Chris would also have finished the race.\n\n3. However, the second statement tells us that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n4. Since Chris did not finish the race, it means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is not met (because if Alex had finished the race, Chris would have finished too).\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. The original conditional statement only tells us what happens when Alex finishes the race, but it doesn't provide information about what happens when Alex does not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
