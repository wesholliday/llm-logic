            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (conditional statement)\n\t* The unicorn was not in the forest (factual statement)\n2. From the second statement, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n3. Now, let's examine the first statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about what happens if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true.\n4. Since we know that the unicorn is not in the forest (from the second statement), this means that the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" cannot be true. If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest, but since it's not, the griffin must not be either.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
