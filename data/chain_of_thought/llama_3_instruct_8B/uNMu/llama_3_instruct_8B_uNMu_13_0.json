The statement says \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\" This means that there is at least one possibility where the toy is not in the toy box.\n2. Since we know that the toy might not be in the toy box, we can infer that it's possible for the toy to be somewhere else (e.g., on the floor, under a couch cushion, etc.).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
