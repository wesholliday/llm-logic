The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\" gives us two possibilities:\n\t* Possibility 1: Cookies are in the jar\n\t* Possibility 2: Cookies are hidden in the pantry\n2. The statement \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" tells us that possibility 2 is not true.\n3. Since possibility 2 (cookies are hidden in the pantry) is false, we can conclude that possibility 1 (cookies are in the jar) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
