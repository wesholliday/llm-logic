We have two statements:\n\t* Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n\t* The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that the first option \"they are perched on her head\" is false.\n\n3. Since the first option is false, the second option \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" must be true (by the law of excluded middle).\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
