However, we know that the second statement (\"The pen isn't on my desk\") is true.\n* Since the pen can't be on my desk (according to the second statement), and one of the options must be true (according to the first statement), it follows that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
