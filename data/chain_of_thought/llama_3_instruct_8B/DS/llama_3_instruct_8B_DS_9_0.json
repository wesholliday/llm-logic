The statement \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" tells us that the second option is not true, i.e., the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n3. Since we know the second option (blending in on the floor) is false, and the only other option is that it's in the box, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
