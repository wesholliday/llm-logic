We have two statements:\n\t* Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden (this is an inclusive \"or\", meaning both options are possible)\n\t* Fido is not in the garden\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that Fido is not in the garden.\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1 again: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. Since we know Fido is not in the garden (from statement 2), this means the first option \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
