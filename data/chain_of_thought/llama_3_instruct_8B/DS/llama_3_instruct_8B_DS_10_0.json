The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the missing sock is not under the bed. This means that the only remaining possibility for the location of the missing sock is the laundry basket, since statement (1) states that either the laundry basket or under the bed are the two possible locations.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
