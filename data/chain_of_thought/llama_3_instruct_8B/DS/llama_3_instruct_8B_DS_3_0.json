The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\" gives us two possibilities:\n\t* Possibility 1: The keys are in the drawer.\n\t* Possibility 2: The keys are dangling in the cabinet.\n2. We know that \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\", which means we can eliminate Possibility 2.\n3. Since Possibility 2 is eliminated, we're left with only one possibility: the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
