The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the cat is indeed napping on the couch, since statement (1) states that either of these two options is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
