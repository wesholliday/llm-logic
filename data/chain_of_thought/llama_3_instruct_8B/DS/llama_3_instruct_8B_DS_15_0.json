The second statement says \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\", which means we can eliminate one of the options.\n3. Since the shoes aren't lined up by the door, it must be true that the shoes are in the closet (since there's only one option left).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are indeed in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
