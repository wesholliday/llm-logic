This implies that there are only two possibilities for the state of the shank: either it must be nugged, or it is plooked.\n3. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\".\n4. This means that the first possibility (the shank must be nugged) is ruled out.\n\nNow, let's combine this information:\n\n* We know there are only two possibilities for the state of the shank: either it must be nugged or it is plooked.\n* The first possibility (it must be nugged) has been ruled out.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the second possibility (the shank is plooked) must be true. This means we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
