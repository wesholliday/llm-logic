We have two statements:\n\t* Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed (N)\n2. From statement N, we can conclude that the flug does not necessarily need to be zimmed.\n3. Since the flug does not necessarily need to be zimmed, it might still be blummed (according to statement E).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is possibly blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
