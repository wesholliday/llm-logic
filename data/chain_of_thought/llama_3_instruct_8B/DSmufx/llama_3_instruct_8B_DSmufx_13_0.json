Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged (This statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the state of the glip: it must be tragged, or it is slogged.)\n2. It's not the case that the glip must be tragged (This statement is negating the first possibility, i.e., the glip does not have to be tragged.)\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that:\n\n* The glip is not tragged (since it's not the case that it must be tragged)\n* Since there are only two possibilities for the state of the glip, and one of them has been ruled out, the other possibility must be true.\n* Therefore, the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
