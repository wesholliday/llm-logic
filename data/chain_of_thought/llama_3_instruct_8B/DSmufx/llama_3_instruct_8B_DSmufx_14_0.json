We have two statements:\n\t* Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the clug must be snugged (\u00acS)\n2. From E, we can infer that either S (the clug must be snugged) or F (the clug is fleeked) is true.\n3. Since \u00acS, we know that S is false.\n4. Therefore, from step 2 and 3, we can conclude that F (the clug is fleeked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
