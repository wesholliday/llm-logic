We have two statements:\n\t* Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the wug must be garpled (NMG)\n\n2. From NMG, we can infer that the wug does not necessarily need to be garpled. This means that there might be a possibility where the wug is not garpled.\n\n3. Now, let's look at E again: Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. Since we've established that the wug doesn't necessarily need to be garpled (from NMG), this leaves us with only one option: the wug might be sproinged.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the wug could possibly be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
