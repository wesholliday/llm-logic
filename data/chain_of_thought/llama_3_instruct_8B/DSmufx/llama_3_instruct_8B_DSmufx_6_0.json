This means that there are only two possibilities:\n\t* The grommet must be plopped\n\t* The grommet is sploffed\n2. We're given a new statement: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\". This means that the first possibility (the grommet must be plopped) is ruled out.\n3. Since the first possibility is ruled out, we can conclude that the second possibility must be true: the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
