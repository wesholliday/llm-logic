We have two statements:\n\t* Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled (N)\n2. From statement N, we can infer that the zinger does not necessarily need to be smoogled.\n3. Since the zinger does not necessarily need to be smoogled, it is possible that it is fraggled (according to statement E).\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger might be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
