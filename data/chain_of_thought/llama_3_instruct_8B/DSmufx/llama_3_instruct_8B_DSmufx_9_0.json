This statement can be rewritten as \"The twonk must be varnished or the twonk is plinked\" (using the inclusive OR operator).\n3. From this, we can infer that if the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked.\n4. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\".\n5. This means that the twonk cannot be plinked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n* If the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked (from step 3).\n* But we know that the twonk cannot be plinked (from step 5).\n\nTherefore, if the twonk is not varnished, this would lead to a contradiction. To avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that:\n\n* The twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
