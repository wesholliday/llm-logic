We have two statements:\n\t* Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled (N)\n2. From statement N, we can conclude that the flugel does not have to be zargled.\n3. Since the flugel does not have to be zargled, it is possible that it is blimmed (from E).\n4. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that the flugel is blimmed, as there might be another possibility (e.g., the flugel could be neither zargled nor blimmed).\n\nTherefore, we can only infer that the flugel might be blimmed, but not necessarily.\n\nAnswer: no",
