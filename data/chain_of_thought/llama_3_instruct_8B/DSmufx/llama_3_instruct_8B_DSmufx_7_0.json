We have two statements:\n\t* Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked (\u00acM)\n2. From statement E, we can infer that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The whiffle must be tinked (M)\n\t* The whiffle is shanked (S)\n3. Since \u00acM is given, we know that M is false.\n4. Therefore, from step 2, we can conclude that S must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
