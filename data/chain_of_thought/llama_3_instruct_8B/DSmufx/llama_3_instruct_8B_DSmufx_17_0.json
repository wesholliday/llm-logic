We have two statements:\n\t* Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the flob must be movated (\u00acM)\n2. From statement E, we can infer that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The flob must be movated (M)\n\t* The flob is skizzled (S)\n3. Since \u00acM is given, we know that M is false.\n4. Therefore, from step 2, we can conclude that S must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
