It's not the case that the smip must be lupped (\u00acM)\n\nWe can start by analyzing statement 2, which says that it's not the case that the smip must be lupped. This implies that the smip does not have to be lupped.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 1, which states that either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped. Since we know from statement 2 that the smip does not have to be lupped, this means that the second option \"it is shripped\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
