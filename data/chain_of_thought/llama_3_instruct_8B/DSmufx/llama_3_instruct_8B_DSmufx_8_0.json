We have two statements:\n\t* Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (\u00acM)\n2. From statement E, we can infer that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The sprocket must be daggled (M)\n\t* The sprocket is cranked (C)\n3. Since \u00acM is given, we know that M is false.\n4. Therefore, from step 2, we can conclude that C must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
