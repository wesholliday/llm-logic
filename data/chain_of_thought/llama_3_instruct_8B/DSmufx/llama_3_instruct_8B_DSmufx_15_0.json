We have two statements:\n\t* Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the dreb must be spened (\u00acS)\n2. From E, we can infer that either S (the dreb must be spened) or V (the dreb is vroombed) is true.\n3. Since \u00acS, we know that S is false.\n4. Therefore, from step 2 and 3, we can conclude that V (the dreb is vroombed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
