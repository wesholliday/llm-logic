We have two statements:\n\t* Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned (\u00acM)\n2. From E, we can infer that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The fleeg must be surned (\u2227S)\n\t* The fleeg is bluttered (\u2227B)\n3. Since \u00acM, we know that the first option (\u2227S) is not true.\n4. Therefore, from E and \u00acM, we can infer that the second option (\u2227B) must be true.\n\nSo, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
