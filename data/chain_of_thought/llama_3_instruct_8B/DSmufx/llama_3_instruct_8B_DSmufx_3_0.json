It's not the case that the splat must be quanked (~Q)\n\nWe can start by using De Morgan's law to rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n~Q = \u00ac(The splat must be quanked)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that \"either...or\" is equivalent to \"not both...and not...\" (i.e., E \u2261 \u00ac(both Q and ~Q)).\n\nSo, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n\u00ac(both The splat must be quanked and it is not the case that the splat must be quanked)\n\nUsing the distributive property of negation over conjunction, this becomes:\n\n\u00ac(The splat must be quanked) \u2227 \u00ac(it is not the case that the splat must be quanked)\n\nSimplifying this using the fact that \"not both\" is equivalent to \"one or the other\", we get:\n\n\u00ac(The splat must be quanked) \u2228 it is morphed\n\nNow, we can use statement 2 (~Q) to conclude that:\n\nit is morphed\n\nAnswer: yes",
