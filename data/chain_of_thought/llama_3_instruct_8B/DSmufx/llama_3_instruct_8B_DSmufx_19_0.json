We have two statements:\n\t* Either the smonk must be plagued or it is vreebled (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the smonk must be plagued (\u00acP)\n2. From E, we can infer that either P \u2228 V is true, where P represents \"the smonk must be plagued\" and V represents \"the smonk is vreebled\".\n3. We also know that \u00acP is true, which means P is false.\n4. Since P is false, the only possibility left is that V is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nThe smonk is vreebled\n\nAnswer: yes",
