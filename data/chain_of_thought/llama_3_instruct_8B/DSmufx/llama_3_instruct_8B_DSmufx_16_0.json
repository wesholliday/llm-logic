We have two statements:\n\t* Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted (\u00acM)\n2. From E, we can infer that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The sneg must be sproted (M)\n\t* The sneg is crampled (C)\n3. Since \u00acM, we know that M is not true.\n4. Therefore, from step 2, we can conclude that C must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
