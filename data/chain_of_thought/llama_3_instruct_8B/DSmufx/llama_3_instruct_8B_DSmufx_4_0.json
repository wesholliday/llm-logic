This statement can be rewritten as a disjunction (a statement that says something is either true or true): \u00ac(the fribble must be crinked) \u2228 (the fribble is snurgled).\n3. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\", which can be rewritten as \u00ac(the fribble must be crinked).\n4. Since both statements are about the same condition (\"the fribble must be crinked\"), we can combine them: \u00ac(the fribble must be crinked) \u2228 (the fribble is snurgled).\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" from these two statements:\n\n1. We know that \u00ac(the fribble must be crinked), which means the fribble cannot be crinked.\n2. From the original statement, we have a disjunction: \u00ac(the fribble must be crinked) \u2228 (the fribble is snurgled).\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false (the fribble cannot be crinked), the second part must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
