The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that the second option (cookies being hidden in the pantry) is false.\n3. Since the second option is false, we can conclude that the first option (cookies being in the jar) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
