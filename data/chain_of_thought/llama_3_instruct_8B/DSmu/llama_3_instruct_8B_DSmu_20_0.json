We have two statements:\n\t* Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head (N)\n2. From statement E, we can conclude that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The sunglasses are in her bag (\u2203bag)\n\t* The sunglasses must be perched on her head (\u2203head)\n3. Since statement N says it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, we can infer that \u2203head is false.\n4. Now, we know that either \u2203bag or \u2203head is true (from E). We've also established that \u2203head is false (from N).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \u2203bag must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
