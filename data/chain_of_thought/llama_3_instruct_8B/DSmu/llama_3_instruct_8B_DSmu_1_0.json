We have two premises:\n\t* Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden (disjunction)\n\t* It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (negation of the second disjunct)\n\n2. From the first premise, we can conclude that either Fido is inside or it's true that Fido is in the garden.\n\n3. Since the second premise states that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, we can infer that Fido is not in the garden (by modus tollens).\n\n4. Now, combining steps 2 and 3, we have: either Fido is inside or Fido is not in the garden.\n\n5. Since Fido cannot be both inside and not in the garden at the same time, we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
