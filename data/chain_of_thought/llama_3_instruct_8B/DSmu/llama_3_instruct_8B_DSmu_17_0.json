We have two statements:\n\t* Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n\t* It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack (since \"it's not the case\" implies the opposite).\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. Since we've already concluded that the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack, this option is ruled out.\n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
