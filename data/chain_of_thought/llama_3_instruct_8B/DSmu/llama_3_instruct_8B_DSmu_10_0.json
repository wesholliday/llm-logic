The statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" implies that there is no necessity for the sock to be under the bed. In other words, it's possible for the sock to be elsewhere (in this case, in the laundry basket).\n3. Since we know that either the sock is in the laundry basket or under the bed, and we've ruled out the possibility of it being under the bed, we can conclude that the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
