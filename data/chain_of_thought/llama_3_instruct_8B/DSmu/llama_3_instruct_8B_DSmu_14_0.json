The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: The milk is on the counter\n\t* Option 2: The milk must be chilling in the fridge\n2. We are given additional information that \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\". This means we can eliminate Option 2.\n3. Since Option 2 is eliminated, we are left with only one option:\n\t* Option 1: The milk is on the counter\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
