The original statement \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: The umbrella is in the car\n\t* Option 2: The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\n\n2. We are given an additional statement \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\", which means we can eliminate Option 2.\n\n3. Since Option 2 has been eliminated, we are left with only one option:\n\t* Option 1: The umbrella is in the car\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the umbrella is indeed in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
