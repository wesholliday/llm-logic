The original statement \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom\" presents a disjunction (either-or) between two possibilities.\n2. The additional information \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" tells us that the second option (playing in the bedroom) is ruled out.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this new information allows us to infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nSince the disjunction presented an either-or situation, and one of the options has been eliminated, we can conclude that the remaining possibility must be true. In other words, since it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom, then the cat must be napping on the couch (by the principle of excluded middle).\n\nAnswer: yes",
