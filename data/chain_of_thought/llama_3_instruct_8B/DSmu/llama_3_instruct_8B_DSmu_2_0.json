The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: The book is on the shelf\n\t* Option 2: The book must be resting on the table\n2. We are given additional information that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\". This means we can eliminate Option 2.\n3. Since Option 2 is eliminated, we are left with only one option:\n\t* Option 1: The book is on the shelf\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
