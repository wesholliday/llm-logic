The original statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: The newspaper is in the driveway\n\t* Option 2: The newspaper must be sitting on the porch\n2. We are given additional information that \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\". This means we can eliminate Option 2.\n3. Since Option 2 is eliminated, we are left with only one option:\n\t* Option 1: The newspaper is in the driveway\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the newspaper is indeed in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
