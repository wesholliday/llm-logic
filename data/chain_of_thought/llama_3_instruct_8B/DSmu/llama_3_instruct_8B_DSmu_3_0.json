The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. We know that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\", which means that the second option (the keys being dangling) is false.\n3. Since the first option (\"The keys are in the drawer\") is not explicitly ruled out, we can conclude that it might be true.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The keys are in the drawer\" because there's still a possibility that both options are false (i.e., neither the keys are in the drawer nor must they be dangling).\n\nAnswer: no",
