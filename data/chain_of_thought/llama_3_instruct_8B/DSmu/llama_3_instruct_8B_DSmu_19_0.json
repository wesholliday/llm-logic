The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: The watch is charging on the dresser\n\t* Option 2: The watch must be on his wrist\n2. We are given additional information that \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\".\n3. This means we can eliminate Option 2, as it is explicitly stated to be false.\n4. Since there are only two options, and one of them has been eliminated, the remaining option must be true:\n\t* The watch is charging on the dresser\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
