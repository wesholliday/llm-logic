The original statement \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: Phone is in the living room\n\t* Option 2: Phone must be ringing in the kitchen\n2. We are given additional information that \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\". This means we can eliminate Option 2.\n3. Since Option 2 is eliminated, we are left with only one option:\n\t* Option 1: Phone is in the living room\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is indeed in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
