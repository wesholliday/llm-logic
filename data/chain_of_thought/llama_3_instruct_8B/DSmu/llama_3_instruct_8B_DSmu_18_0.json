The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" gives us two possibilities:\n\t* Possibility 1: The notebook is in the drawer.\n\t* Possibility 2: The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\n2. The second statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" tells us that possibility 2 is false.\n\n3. Since possibility 2 is false, we can conclude that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand.\n\n4. From step 1, we know that either the notebook is in the drawer or it's sitting on the nightstand. Since we've ruled out the second option (it's not sitting on the nightstand), the only remaining possibility is:\n\t* The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
