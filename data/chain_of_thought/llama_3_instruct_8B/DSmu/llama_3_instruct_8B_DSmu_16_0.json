This statement can be rewritten as a disjunction (OR): \"The pen is in my bag OR the pen must be on my desk\".\n3. We are given an additional statement: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\".\n4. From this, we can conclude that the pen cannot be on my desk.\n\nNow, let's consider the original disjunction again:\n\n\"The pen is in my bag OR the pen must be on my desk\"\n\nWe've already established that the pen cannot be on my desk (from statement 3). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is indeed in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
