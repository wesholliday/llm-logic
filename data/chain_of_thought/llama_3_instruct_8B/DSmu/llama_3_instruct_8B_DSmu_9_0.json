We have two statements:\n\t* Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\t* It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor (since \"it's not the case\" implies the opposite).\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\". Since we've already concluded that it can't be blending in on the floor, this means that the only remaining option is that the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
