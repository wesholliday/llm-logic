The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" negates the possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the first option \"the jacket is draped over the chair\" must be true, since it's the only remaining possibility after ruling out the second option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
