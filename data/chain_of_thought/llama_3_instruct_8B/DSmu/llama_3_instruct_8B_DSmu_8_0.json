The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: Remote control is on the coffee table\n\t* Option 2: Remote control must be hiding under the couch\n\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" tells us that Option 2 is false.\n\n3.
