We have two statements:\n\t* Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf (N)\n2. From statement E, we can conclude that either of the following is true:\n\t* The toy is in the toy box\n\t* The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\n3. Since statement N says it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, we can eliminate this option.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is indeed in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
