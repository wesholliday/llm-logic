Premise 2: The pen isn't on my desk.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that:\nThe pen is not on my desk.\n\nNow, let's combine this conclusion with premise 1:\n\nEither the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\nThe pen is not on my desk.\n\nUsing logical disjunction (either/or), we can eliminate one of the options. Since the pen is not on my desk, we can conclude that:\nThe pen must be in my bag.\n\nThis argument follows a valid pattern of reasoning:\n\nPremise 1 sets up a binary choice between two possibilities.\nPremise 2 eliminates one of those possibilities.\nConclusion logically follows from the remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
