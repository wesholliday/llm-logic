Premise 2: The book isn't resting on the table.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf (since it's not resting on the table).\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a classic pattern of disjunction and negation:\n\n* Disjunction: Either A or B (premise 1)\n* Negation: Not-B (premise 2)\n* Conclusion: Therefore, A\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the book is on the shelf\", and B represents \"the book is resting on the table\". The argument shows that if we negate B (it's not resting on the table), then we can conclude that A must be true (the book is on the shelf).\n\nAnswer: yes",
