Premise 2: The toy isn't sitting on the shelf (~S)\n3. Conclusion: The toy is in the toy box (T)\n\nUsing logical operators, we can rewrite the argument as:\n\n(E \u2228 S) \u2227 ~S \u2283 T\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, let's analyze it using the rules of propositional logic.\n\n1. From premise 2 (~S), we know that the negation of \"the toy is sitting on the shelf\" is true.\n2. Using the rule of material implication (\u2283), we can infer that if ~S is true, then either E or S must be true.\n3. Since we already know that ~S is true, this means that E (the toy is in the toy box) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical structure:\n\n(E \u2228 S) \u2227 ~S \u2283 T\n\nAnswer: yes",
