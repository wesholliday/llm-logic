Premise 2: The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that the watch must be somewhere else (since it's not on his wrist). Since there are only two possibilities mentioned in premise 1 (the watch being charging on the dresser or being on his wrist), and one of those options has been eliminated (it's not on his wrist), the other option must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that:\n\nThe watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
