Premise 2: The sunglasses aren't perched on her head (~P)\n\nWe can simplify the premises using logical operators:\n\nE: (B \u2228 P)\n~P\n\nWhere B represents \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" and P represents \"the sunglasses are perched on her head\".\n\nNow, let's try to derive the conclusion from the premises:\n\nConclusion: The sunglasses are in her bag (B)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n~P \u2192 B (from E and ~P)\n\nThis means that if the sunglasses aren't perched on her head (~P), then they must be in her bag (B).\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical structure. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and there's no possibility of deriving a contradictory conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
