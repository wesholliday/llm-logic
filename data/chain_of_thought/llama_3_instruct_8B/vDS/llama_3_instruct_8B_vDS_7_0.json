The first premise states that either the umbrella is in the car or it's tucked away in the closet: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it's tucked away in the closet\"\n2. The second premise states that the umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can deduce that:\n\n* If the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet (as stated in premise 2), then it must be in the car (since it's either in the car or the closet, as stated in premise 1).\n\nThis conclusion logically follows from the given premises. Therefore,\n\nAnswer: yes",
