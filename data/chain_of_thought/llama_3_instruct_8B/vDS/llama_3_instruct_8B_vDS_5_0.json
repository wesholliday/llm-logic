Premise 2: The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that the cookies must be somewhere else. Since they're not hidden in the pantry (by assumption), and there's only two possible locations mentioned (the jar or the pantry), it follows logically that:\n\n3. Conclusion: The cookies are in the jar.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it uses a disjunction (either/or) as its first premise, which sets up a binary choice between two possibilities. Then, by eliminating one of those possibilities (the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry), we can conclude that the other possibility must be true (the cookies are in the jar).\n\nAnswer: yes",
