From the first statement, we know that the cake is not chocolate.\n3. The second statement says that if the cake were chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. This implies a conditional relationship between the cake's color and the muffins' flavor.\n4. Since we've established that the cake is not chocolate (from step 2), it means that the condition in the second statement (\"the cake was chocolate\") is not met.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the muffins are blueberry, because the condition for them to be blueberry (i.e., the cake being chocolate) is not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
