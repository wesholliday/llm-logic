We want to infer whether Bob chose pasta or not.\n3. From the first statement, we know that Sue did not choose pizza (S \u00acP).\n4. Now, let's analyze the second statement: SP \u2192 B. This means that if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n5. However, since Sue did not choose pizza (S \u00acP), this conditional statement is irrelevant to our inference about Bob's choice.\n\nWe cannot conclude whether Bob chose pasta or not based on these two statements alone. The information provided does not provide a direct link between Sue's non-choice of pizza and Bob's choice of pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
