            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* Lisa did not buy the red shirt\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n2. From the first statement, we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This means that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n4. Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt (from step 2), it's possible that she didn't buy any shirt at all. Or maybe she bought a different shirt altogether.\n5. The second statement only talks about what would happen if Lisa had bought the red shirt, but it doesn't provide information about Mark's actions in other scenarios.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Mark's actions (including whether he bought the blue shirt or not) based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
