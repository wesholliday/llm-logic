We want to infer whether Erin took a train or not.\n3. From statement S, we know that Sam did not take a plane.\n4. Now, let's consider the conditional statement T \u2192 E. This means that if Sam had taken a plane, Erin would have taken a train.\n5. However, since Sam did not take a plane (from statement S), this condition is not met.\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Erin took a train or not.\n\nThe key insight here is that the conditional statement T \u2192 E only provides information about what would happen if Sam took a plane, but it doesn't provide any direct information about whether Erin actually took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
