We have two statements:\n\t* Mary was not at the wedding (M)\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (IM \u2192 S)\n2. We want to infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not.\n3. From statement M, we know that Mary was not at the wedding.\n4. Statement IM \u2192 S says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies when the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true.\n5. Since we already established that Mary was not at the wedding (M), the condition of the conditional statement IM \u2192 S is false.\n6. When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the conclusion (Sue being at the wedding) cannot be inferred.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
