From the first statement, we know that the alien did not visit Mars.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is true.\n4. Since we already established that the alien did not visit Mars, this condition is false.\n5. Therefore, the second statement does not apply to our situation, and we cannot conclude anything about the robot's visit to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
