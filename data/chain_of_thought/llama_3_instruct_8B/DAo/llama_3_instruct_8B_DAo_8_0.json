The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the conclusion (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\n3. However, we are given information that contradicts the condition: \"The vampire was not awake\". This means that the condition (the vampire being awake) is actually false.\n\n4. Since the condition is false, we cannot conclude that the mummy was awake, as the conditional statement only guarantees the conclusion if the condition is true.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the mummy's state of wakefulness from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
