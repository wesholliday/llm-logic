We have two statements:\n\t* \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means that it's saying that if a certain condition is true (in this case, the griffin being in the forest), then another statement must also be true (the unicorn being in the forest).\n3. Since we know from Statement A that the griffin was not in the forest, we can conclude that the condition of Statement B is false (i.e., the griffin is not in the forest).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was or was not in the forest based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
