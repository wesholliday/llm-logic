We want to infer whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n3. From statement I, we can conclude that if Tom had watched football, Jen would have watched basketball.\n4. However, statement T tells us that Tom did not watch football.\n5. Since Tom didn't watch football, the condition in statement I is not met (Tom didn't watch football, so Jen wouldn't have watched basketball either).\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Jen actually watched basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
