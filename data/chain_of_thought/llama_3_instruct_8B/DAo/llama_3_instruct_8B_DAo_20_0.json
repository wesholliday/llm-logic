Statement B is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about what happens if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true.\n3. Since we know that the apple is not red (from statement A), the antecedent of statement B is false.\n4. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the consequent (the banana being yellow) does not necessarily follow. In other words, just because the apple is not red, it doesn't mean the banana is not yellow.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
