We are given two statements:\n\t* Joe did not go to the park (premise)\n\t* If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (conditional statement)\n2. We want to infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n3. Since Joe did not go to the park (from premise), we can conclude that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is false.\n4. Therefore, the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" does not apply in this case.\n5. We cannot infer whether Lucy actually went to the zoo or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
