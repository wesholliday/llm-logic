We have two statements:\n\t* \"The book was not written by James\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B implies that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel.\n3. Since Statement A says the book was not written by James, we can conclude that the condition in Statement B (the book being written by James) is not true.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel from Statement B, because the condition for the implication is not met.\n5. However, since we know the book was not written by James (Statement A), we can conclude that it's possible the book might be a different type of novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
