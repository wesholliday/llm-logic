            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* The doll was not plastic\n\t* If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\n2. From the first statement, we know that the doll is not plastic.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true.\n4. Since we already established that the doll is not plastic, this condition is false.\n5. Therefore, the second statement does not apply to our situation.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about the truck:\n\n* We can't conclude anything about the truck from the first statement (\"The doll was not plastic\") because it doesn't provide any information about the truck.\n* The second statement only applies if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, but since it's false, we can't use this statement to infer anything about the truck.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal from these two statements. We simply don't have enough information to make a conclusion about the truck.\n\nAnswer: no",
