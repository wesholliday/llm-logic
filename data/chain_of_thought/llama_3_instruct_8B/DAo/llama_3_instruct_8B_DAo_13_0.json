From CNR, we can conclude that the car is not red.\n3. Now, let's consider ICR-TB. If the car were indeed red, then it would imply that the truck is blue.\n4. However, since we know from step 2 that the car is not red (CNR), we cannot apply the conditional statement ICR-TB.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
