From the first statement, we know that the shirt is not cotton.\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true.\n4. Since we already established that the shirt is not cotton, this condition is false.\n5. Therefore, the second statement does not apply to our situation, and we cannot conclude anything about the pants.\n\nAnswer: no",
