We are given two statements:\n\t* \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (J\u00acB)\n\t* \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" (J\u2192A)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis. However, since Jeff did not play basketball (from step 2), this condition is not met.\n\n4. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Amy played tennis or didn't play tennis based on this information alone.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Amy did not play tennis\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
