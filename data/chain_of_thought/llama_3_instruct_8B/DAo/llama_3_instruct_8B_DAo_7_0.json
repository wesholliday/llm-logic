We want to infer whether Chris finished the race or not.\n3. From statement B, we can conclude that if Alex had finished the race, Chris would have also finished the race.\n4. However, statement A tells us that Alex did not finish the race.\n5. Since Alex didn't finish the race, it's impossible for Chris to have finished the race (based on statement B).\n6. Therefore, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
