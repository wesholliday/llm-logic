            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf C (cake is chocolate) then M (muffins are blueberry)\n\n2. The second premise is \"The muffins were not blueberry\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acM (not M)\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The cake was not chocolate\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acC (not C)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. From premise 2, we know that the muffins are not blueberry. This means that the condition \"the muffins are blueberry\" cannot be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the cake is chocolate (C). If it were, then the muffins would be blueberry (M), but we just established that this is impossible. Therefore, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nThis reasoning leads us to conclude that \u00acC, which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nSince the premises entail the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
