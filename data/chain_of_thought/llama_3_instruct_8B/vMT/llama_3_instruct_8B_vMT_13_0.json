Therefore, the car was not red (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows a valid logical form.\n\nThe first premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as:\n\n\u00ac(the car was red) \u2228 (the truck was blue)\n\nThis means that either the car was not red or the truck was blue.\n\nThe second premise \"The truck was not blue\" can be rewritten as:\n\n\u00ac(the truck was blue)\n\nUsing logical operators, we can combine these two premises to get:\n\n\u00ac(the car was red) \u2228 \u00ac(the truck was blue)\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion \"The car was not red\". This can be rewritten as:\n\n\u00ac(the car was red)\n\nWe can see that the conclusion logically follows from the combined premises. If the truck is not blue (second premise), then it must be true that either the car is not red or the truck is not blue (first premise). Therefore, we can conclude that the car is indeed not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
