Premise 2: The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that:\n\n3. Not (the book is a mystery novel) (by modus tollens from premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: The book was not written by James.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, we would need to use the first premise and infer that:\n\n4. Not (the book was written by James) (by modus tollens from premise 1 and step 3)\n\nHowever, this is where the argument falls short. We cannot directly conclude that the book was not written by James solely based on the fact that it's not a mystery novel. The first premise only establishes a relationship between being written by James and being a mystery novel, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when these conditions are not met.\n\nIn other words, we can't assume that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. There might be other possibilities, such as the book being written by someone else or being a different genre altogether.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: no",
