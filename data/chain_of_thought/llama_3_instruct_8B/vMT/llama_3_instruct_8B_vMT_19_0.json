            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\".\n2. The second premise is \"Jen did not watch basketball\". This is a simple statement that asserts the negation of Jen watching basketball.\n3. The conclusion is \"Tom did not watch football\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. But since Jen didn't watch basketball (second premise), it means that Tom must not have watched football either.\n\nThe conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" logically follows from the premises. The argument is valid because it uses a correct application of modus tollens (a rule of inference): if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes",
