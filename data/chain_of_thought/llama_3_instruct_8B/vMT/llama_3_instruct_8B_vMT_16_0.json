Premise 2: The pants were not denim.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim (using modus tollens).\n\n3. From premise 2, we know that the pants are indeed not denim.\n\nNow, combining steps 1 and 3, we can conclude that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim.\n\n4. Since the pants are not denim (from premise 2), it follows that the shirt must be non-cotton (using modus ponens).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
