Premise 2: The mummy was not awake (This is a categorical statement)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the mummy was not awake, then it's not possible for the vampire to be awake.\n\n3. Conclusion: The vampire was not awake\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of modus tollens:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q (Premise 1)\n\u00acQ (Premise 2)\n\u2234 \u00acP (Conclusion)\n\nWhere P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
