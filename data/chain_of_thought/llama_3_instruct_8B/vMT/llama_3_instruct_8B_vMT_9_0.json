            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n2. The second premise is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", which can be represented as \u00acQ.\n3. The conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the correct form of a conditional statement.\n\nThe correct form would be:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q)\nMark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acQ)\n\u2234 Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP)\n\nThe argument follows this correct form, so it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
