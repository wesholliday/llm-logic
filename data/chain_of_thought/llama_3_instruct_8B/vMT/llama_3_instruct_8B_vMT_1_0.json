            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (This is a conditional statement)\n2. Premise 2: Sue was not at the wedding\n3. Conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding (this is a conditional statement).\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that the condition \"Sue was at the wedding\" is false.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the conclusion: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since Sue was not at the wedding (premise 2), it follows logically that Mary was not at the wedding either.\n\nThe argument is valid because it uses a correct application of modus tollens (a rule of inference). Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not-Q, then not-P. In this case:\n\nP: Mary was at the wedding\nQ: Sue was at the wedding\n\nNot-Q: Sue was not at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Not-P: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
