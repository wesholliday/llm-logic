            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\".\n2. The second premise is \"Kate did not eat salad\". This is a categorical statement that asserts the negation of Kate eating salad.\n3. The conclusion is \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the correct form of an argument.\n\nThe argument appears to be using modus tollens (MT), which is a valid form of argument:\n\nMT: If A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\n\nIn our case, we can substitute the premises as follows:\n\nA = Ben ate pasta\nB = Kate ate salad\n\nSo, the argument becomes:\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad)\nKate did not eat salad (\u00acKate ate salad)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n\u00ac(Ben ate pasta) (\u00acBen ate pasta)\n\nThis is equivalent to saying \"Ben did not eat pasta\", which is the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid.",
