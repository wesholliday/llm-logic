Premise: Chris did not finish the race\n3. Conclusion: Alex did not finish the race\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. This means that if Chris didn't finish the race (as stated in premise 2), then Alex must not have finished the race either.\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it uses a correct form of logical inference: modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not-Q, then not-P. In this case, P is \"Alex finished the race\", Q is \"Chris finished the race\", and not-Q is \"Chris did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
