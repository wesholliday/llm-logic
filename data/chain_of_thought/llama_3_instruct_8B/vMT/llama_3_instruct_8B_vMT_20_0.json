            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (apple is red) then B (banana is yellow)\n\n2. The second premise is \"The banana was not yellow\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acB (banana is not yellow)\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The apple was not red\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acA (apple is not red)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if A (apple is red) then B (banana is yellow). But from premise 2, we know that \u00acB (banana is not yellow). This means that B cannot be true. Therefore, the conditional statement \"If A then B\" is actually false.\n\nSince the conditional statement is false, it does not guarantee that \u00acA (apple is not red) follows. In other words, just because the banana is not yellow, we cannot conclude that the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
