            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\nThis premise states that if a certain condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then another condition (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n\n2. Premise 2: \"The unicorn was not in the forest\"\nThis premise states that the condition mentioned in premise 1 (the unicorn being in the forest) is actually false.\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The griffin was not in the forest\"\nTo reach this conclusion, we need to use modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not-Q, then not-P.\n\nIn our case, we can apply modus tollens as follows:\n\n* If the griffin was in the forest (P), then the unicorn was in the forest (Q)\n* The unicorn was not in the forest (not-Q)\n* Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest (not-P)\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it uses a valid argument form (modus tollens) and follows the correct logical steps. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
