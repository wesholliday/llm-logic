            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. If we assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (contrary to the initial condition), this would mean that the condition in the original statement is not met.\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. In fact, there's no information that suggests Mark necessarily bought the blue shirt if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
