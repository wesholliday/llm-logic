The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris.\n2. This means that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish the race (by definition of \"if-then\").\n3. However, this does not imply that if Alex does not finish the race, Chris will not finish the race.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish, it doesn't mean that if Alex doesn't finish, Chris won't finish either. There could be a scenario where Chris finishes despite Alex not finishing.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
