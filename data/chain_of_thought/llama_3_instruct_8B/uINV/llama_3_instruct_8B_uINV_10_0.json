The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies that there is a relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location.\n2. This relationship can be represented as an if-then statement: If (dog is inside), Then (cat is outside).\n3. Now, we want to infer whether \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\". To do this, we need to negate both parts of the original statement.\n4. Negating the first part (\"the dog was inside\") gives us \"the dog was not inside\".\n5. Negating the second part (\"the cat was outside\") gives us \"the cat was not outside\" (or equivalently, \"the cat was inside\").\n6. Now we can see that if the dog is not inside, it doesn't necessarily mean the cat is not outside. The cat could still be outside even if the dog is not inside.\n7. However, we can also infer that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be inside (since the original statement says \"if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside\", and negating this gives us \"if the dog is not inside, then the cat is inside\").\n\nSo, while we cannot directly conclude that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside, we can infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat must be inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
