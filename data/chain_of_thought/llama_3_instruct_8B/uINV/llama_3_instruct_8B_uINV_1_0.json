            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue.\n2. This means that if Mary is present at the wedding, Sue must also be present (by definition of the condition).\n3. However, this does not imply anything about the converse: if Mary is NOT present at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean Sue is not present either.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Sue was already at the wedding before Mary arrived or left, so Sue could still be there even if Mary isn't.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between Mary and Sue when both are present, but does not provide any insight into their individual attendance status.\n\nAnswer: no",
