            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. This means that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy will also go to the zoo (by definition of the conditional statement).\n3. However, this does not imply that if Joe does NOT go to the park, Lucy will NOT go to the zoo.\n\nIn other words, there is no direct connection between Joe not going to the park and Lucy not going to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy might still go to the zoo even if Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
