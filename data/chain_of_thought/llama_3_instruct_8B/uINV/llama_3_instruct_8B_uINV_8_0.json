This means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the condition is false (the vampire is not awake), then the consequence must also be false.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that when the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake, it doesn't mean that when the vampire is asleep, the mummy might or might not be asleep. There could be other factors at play that affect the mummy's state of being awake or asleep.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
