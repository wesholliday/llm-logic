            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies a conditional relationship between the type of shirt and the type of pants.\n2. This means that if the shirt is cotton, we can conclude with certainty that the pants are denim.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the shirt is NOT cotton, then the pants are NOT denim.\n\nThere could be other possibilities where the shirt is not cotton but the pants are still denim. For example, the shirt might be made of polyester and the pants are denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
