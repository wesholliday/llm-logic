            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the properties of the doll and the truck.\n2. If the condition is true (the doll is plastic), then the consequence is also true (the truck is metal).\n3. However, this does not imply that if the condition is false (the doll is not plastic), then the consequence is also false (the truck is not metal).\n\nThe original statement only provides information about what happens when the doll is plastic, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. The relationship between the properties of the doll and the truck is not necessarily inverse or reciprocal.\n\nAnswer: no",
