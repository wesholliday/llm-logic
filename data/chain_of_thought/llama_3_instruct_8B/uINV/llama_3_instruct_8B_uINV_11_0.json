            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies a conditional relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins.\n2. This means that if the cake is indeed chocolate, we can conclude with certainty that the muffins are blueberry.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the cake is NOT chocolate, then the muffins are definitely NOT blueberry.\n\nThere could be other possibilities where the cake is not chocolate but the muffins are still blueberry (e.g., vanilla cake with blueberry muffins).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. There might be exceptions to this rule.\n\nAnswer: no",
