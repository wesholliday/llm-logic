The statement says \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This implies that there is a correlation between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n2. However, this does not imply that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. There could be other possibilities:\n\t* Sue didn't choose pizza, but Bob still chose pasta.\n\t* Sue didn't choose pizza, and Bob chose something else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
