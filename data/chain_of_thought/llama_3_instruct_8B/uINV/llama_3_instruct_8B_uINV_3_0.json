The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies that there is a relationship between the author and the genre of the book.\n2. This relationship can be represented as an if-then statement: If (author = James), Then (genre = mystery).\n3. Now, let's consider the opposite scenario: \"If the book was not written by James\". This means we are negating the condition in step 2.\n\nUsing logical negation, we get: Not (author = James).\n\n4. Since the original statement only mentioned a relationship between James and mystery novels, it doesn't provide any information about other authors or genres.\n5. Therefore, if the book was not written by James, we cannot infer anything about its genre, including whether it's a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
