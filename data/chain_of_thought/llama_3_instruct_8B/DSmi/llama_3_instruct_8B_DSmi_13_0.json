The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" gives us two possibilities:\n\t* Possibility 1: The toy is in the toy box.\n\t* Possibility 2: The toy is sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n2. The additional statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" tells us that possibility 2 (the toy being on the bookshelf) is not certain, but it's possible.\n\n3. Since we know that possibility 2 (the toy being on the bookshelf) is not certain, and we also know that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf (from statement 1), we can conclude that:\n\t* The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\t* Therefore, the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
