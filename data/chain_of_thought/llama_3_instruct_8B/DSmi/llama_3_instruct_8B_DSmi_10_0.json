However, statement 2 tells us that the missing sock might not be under the bed. This means that there is a possibility that the missing sock is indeed under the bed.\n\nSince we cannot conclude with certainty that the missing sock is under the bed (due to the \"might not\" phrase), we can't rule out the possibility that it's in the laundry basket either.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
