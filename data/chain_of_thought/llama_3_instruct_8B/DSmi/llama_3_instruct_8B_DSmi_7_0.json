However, we know that it might not be tucked away in the closet (statement 2).\n\nThis means that there's a possibility that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. If that's the case, then it must be in the car (again, according to statement 1).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the umbrella is indeed in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
