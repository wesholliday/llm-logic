The statement \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" suggests that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n3. Since we know that the scarf must be either on the coat rack or in the backpack, and we've established that it might not be on the coat rack, this means that the scarf could indeed be in my backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
