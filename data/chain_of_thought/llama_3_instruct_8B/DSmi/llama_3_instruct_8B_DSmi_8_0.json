The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" gives us two possibilities:\n\t* Possibility 1: Remote control is on the coffee table\n\t* Possibility 2: Remote control is hiding under the couch\n\n2. The additional statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" adds a nuance to possibility 2:\n\t* Possibility 2a: Remote control is indeed hiding under the couch (but we're not sure)\n\t* Possibility 2b: Remote control is not hiding under the couch (we're not sure about this either)\n\n3. Since possibility 2b is now a viable option, we can't conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table. The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" leaves room for the remote control to be somewhere else entirely.\n\nAnswer: no",
