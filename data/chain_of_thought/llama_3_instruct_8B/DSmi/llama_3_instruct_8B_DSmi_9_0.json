We have two statements:\n\t* Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\t* The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\n2. From statement 1, we can conclude that there are only two possibilities: either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it's blending in on the floor.\n\n3. Statement 2 says that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. This doesn't provide any new information about whether the puzzle piece is in the box or not.\n\n4. Since statement 1 already covers all possible scenarios, and statement 2 doesn't add any new information, we can conclude that the original statement 1 still holds true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that either the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box or it must be blending in on the floor (as stated in statement 1).\n\nAnswer: yes",
