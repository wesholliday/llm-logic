The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" tells us that there are only two possibilities for Fido's location: either he is inside or he is in the garden.\n2. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that it's possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that he could be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Fido is inside, then the first statement is true (Fido is indeed inside).\n* If Fido is not inside, then the first statement implies that Fido must be in the garden. But we know from the second statement that it's possible that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nSince we can't rule out the possibility that Fido is not in the garden, we can't conclude for certain that Fido is inside. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
