In this case, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n* However, if the book is indeed resting on the table, then statement 2 would be false, and we wouldn't know whether the book is on the shelf or not.\n\nSince we have no additional information to rule out the possibility of the book being on the shelf, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
