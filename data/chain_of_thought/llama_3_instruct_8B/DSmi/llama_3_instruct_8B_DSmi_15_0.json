The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" implies that there are only two possibilities for the location of the shoes: either they are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\n2. The additional statement \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\" suggests that it's possible that the shoes are not actually lined up by the door, but rather somewhere else.\n3. Since we know that there are only two possibilities for the location of the shoes (closet or lined up by the door), and one of those possibilities is ruled out (\"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\"), it follows that the other possibility must be true: the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
