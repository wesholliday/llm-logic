The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n3. We know that the first statement \"The flugel was zargled\" is true.\n4. Since the second statement says that if the flugel was blimmed, it would be zargled, and we already know that the flugel was indeed zargled, this means that the condition (the flugel being blimmed) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
