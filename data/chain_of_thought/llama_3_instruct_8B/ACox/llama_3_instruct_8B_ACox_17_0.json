The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the whiffle being shanked) is true, then the consequence (the whiffle being tinked) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The whiffle was tinked\" is true.\n4. From this, we can conclude that the condition in the second statement (\"If the whiffle was shanked\") must also be true, since the consequence (\"then the whiffle was tinked\") is already known to be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was shanked\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
