We have two statements:\n\t* \"The grommet plopped the frink\"\n\t* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n3. We are given that both statements are true: \"The grommet plopped the frink\" and \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\".\n4. Since the consequence of the conditional statement is true (\"the grommet plopped the frink\"), we can infer that the condition must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The grommet was sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
