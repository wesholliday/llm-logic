It says that if the twonk is plinked, then it must be varnished. However, this does not imply that the twonk was actually plinked; it only establishes a connection between the two states.\n\nSince we know from statement (1) that the twonk is varnished, but we don't have any information about whether it was plinked or not, we cannot infer that the twonk was plinked. The conditional relationship in statement (2) does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the twonk's past actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
