The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat being quanked) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The splat was quanked\" is indeed true.\n4. Since the consequence of the conditional statement (\"the splat was quanked\") matches the given fact (\"The splat was quanked\"), we can conclude that the condition (the splat being morphed) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
