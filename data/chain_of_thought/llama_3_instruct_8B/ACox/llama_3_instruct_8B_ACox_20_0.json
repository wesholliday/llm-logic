In other words, if something is sproinged, it must also be garpled.\n\nNow, let's examine statement (1): \"The wug was garpled\". This tells us that the wug indeed has the property of being garpled.\n\nSince we know that being sproinged is a sufficient condition for being garpled, and the wug is already known to be garpled, it follows logically that the wug must also have been sproinged. Otherwise, it wouldn't be garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug was sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
