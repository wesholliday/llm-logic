The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the consequence (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The sprocket was daggled\" is indeed true.\n4. Since we know that the sprocket being daggled implies that it was cranked (according to the second statement), and we have evidence that the sprocket was indeed daggled, we can conclude that:\n\t* If the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled.\n\t* And since it is indeed daggled, it must have been cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
