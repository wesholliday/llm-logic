The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanking) will also be true.\n3. We are given that the splat quanked, which is the consequence mentioned in the second statement.\n4. Since the consequence is true, we can infer that the condition must also be true. In other words, if the splat quanked, then it must have been morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
