The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinked) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The fribble crinked\" is indeed true.\n4. From this, we can conclude that the condition in the second statement (\"If the fribble was snurgled\") must also be true, since the consequence (\"the fribble crinked\") is already known to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
