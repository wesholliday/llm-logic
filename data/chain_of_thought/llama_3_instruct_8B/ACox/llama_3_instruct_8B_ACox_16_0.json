The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (the grommet being plopped) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The grommet was plopped\" is indeed true.\n4. Since we know that the grommet being plopped is a consequence of the grommet being sploffed (according to the second statement), and we have evidence that the grommet was plopped, it follows that the condition (the grommet being sploffed) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet was sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
