The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the consequence (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The zinger was smoogled\" is true.\n4. Since the second statement says that if the zinger was fraggled, then it would be smoogled, and we know that the zinger was indeed smoogled, we can conclude that the condition (the zinger being fraggled) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
