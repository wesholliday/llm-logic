The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble being crinked) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The fribble was crinked\" is indeed true.\n4. From this, we can conclude that the condition in the second statement (\"the fribble was snurgled\") could be true, but it's not necessarily true.\n5. However, since the consequence of being snurgled implies being crinked, and we know the fribble is indeed crinked, we cannot rule out the possibility that the fribble might have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
