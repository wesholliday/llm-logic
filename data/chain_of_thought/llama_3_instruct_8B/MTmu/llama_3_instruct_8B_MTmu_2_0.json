            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest (this is a conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that the unicorn did not necessarily have to be in the forest. This means that the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" does not guarantee that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n3. Since the condition is not met (i.e., the unicorn may or may not be in the forest), we cannot conclude that the griffin must be in the forest either.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
