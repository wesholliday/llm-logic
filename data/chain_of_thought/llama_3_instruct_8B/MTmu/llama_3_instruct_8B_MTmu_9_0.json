            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This implies that there is a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This means that the condition in step 1 is not satisfied.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about Lisa buying the red shirt:\n\n* If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark wouldn't be required to buy the blue shirt (since the condition is not met).\n* But we know that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt even if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
