This implies that if the shirt is cotton, the pants are denim.\n3. However, we're given a new statement: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\".\n4. This means that the pants might not be denim.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about the shirt:\n\n5. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim (from step 1).\n6. But we know that it's not the case that the pants are denim (step 3).\n7. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton, because if it were, the pants would have to be denim, but they're not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
