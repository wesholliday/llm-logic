We are given two statements:\n\t* If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (contradiction to the conditional statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Tom did watch football, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n3. However, the second statement contradicts this inference by stating that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n4. This means that Jen cannot have watched basketball, given the conditional statement.\n5. Since the conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\", and we've established that Jen didn't watch basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
