We are given two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (this is a conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that Chris must have finished the face (this is a negation of a hypothetical statement)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris would also have finished the race.\n\n3. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This implies that Chris might not have finished the race.\n\n4. Since Chris might not have finished the race, we cannot conclude that Alex did or did not finish the race based on the information provided.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Alex did not finish the race' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
