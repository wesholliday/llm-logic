We are given two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy might not be awake after all.\n4. Since the mummy might not be awake, and the first statement says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, we can conclude that the vampire cannot be awake (otherwise, the mummy would be awake, but it's not).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
