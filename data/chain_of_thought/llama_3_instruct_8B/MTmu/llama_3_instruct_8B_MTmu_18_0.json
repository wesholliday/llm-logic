            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\t* It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\n2. From statement (1), we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be metal (since it's not the case that the truck must have been metal).\n\n3. Now, let's consider the negation of the original statement: \"The doll was not plastic\".\n\n4. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck could potentially be anything (not just metal). This is because there is no logical connection between the doll being non-plastic and the truck being a specific material.\n\n5. However, we are given statement (2), which tells us that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the truck could potentially be something other than metal.\n\n6. Combining steps 4 and 5, we can see that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck could still be something other than metal (since it's not the case that the truck must have been metal).\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
