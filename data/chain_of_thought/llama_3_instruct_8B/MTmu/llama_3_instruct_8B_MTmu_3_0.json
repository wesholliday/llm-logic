We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book is written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means that the book cannot be a mystery novel (since it's not the case that it must be).\n4. Now, let's go back to the first statement: if the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n5. Since we've already established that the book cannot be a mystery novel, this means that the book cannot have been written by James (since the condition \"the book is a mystery novel\" is not met).\n\nAnswer: yes",
