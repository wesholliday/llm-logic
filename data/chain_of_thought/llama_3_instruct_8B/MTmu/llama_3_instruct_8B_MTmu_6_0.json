We are given two statements:\n\t* If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (contradiction to the conditional statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob would not be forced to choose pasta.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that Bob might not have chosen pasta even if Sue chose pizza.\n4. Since Bob might not have chosen pasta even if Sue chose pizza, we cannot conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
