This implies that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins might not be blueberry.\n3. We are given a new statement: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n4. From this, we can conclude that it's possible for the muffins to not be blueberry (since it's not the case that they must be).\n5. Since the cake was either chocolate or not chocolate, and the muffins might not be blueberry, we can't determine the color of the cake solely based on the information about the muffins.\n6. However, we know that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins might not be blueberry (from step 2).\n7. Since it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (step 3), this implies that the cake could be non-chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
