This implies that there is a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n3. The second given statement is \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\".\n4. This means that Amy did not play tennis (since it's not the case that she must have played tennis).\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about Jeff:\n\n5. From step 1, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n6. But from step 4, we know that Amy did not play tennis.\n7. Therefore, it cannot be the case that Jeff played basketball (since if he had, Amy would have played tennis).\n\nAnswer: yes",
