We are given two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (this is a conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue might or might not have been at the wedding (we don't know for sure).\n4. Since we can't conclude with certainty whether Sue was at the wedding, we can't use this information to infer anything about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
