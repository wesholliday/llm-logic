            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\".\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\n2. We are given another statement: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\".\nThis statement negates the possibility of the truck being blue.\n\n3. Now, let's combine steps 1 and 2. If the car was red, then the truck would have to be blue (according to the original statement). But we know that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue (from the second statement).\n\n4. This means that if the car was indeed red, the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" would be false.\n\n5. Since the conditional statement is false when the antecedent (\"the car was red\") is true, we can conclude that the antecedent itself is also false: the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
