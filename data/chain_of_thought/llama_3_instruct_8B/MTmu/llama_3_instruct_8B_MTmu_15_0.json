We are given two statements:\n\t* If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (conditional statement)\n\t* It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (contradiction of the conditional statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin would have taken a train.\n3. However, the second statement contradicts this inference, stating that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n4. This means that Erin didn't take a train, which in turn implies that Sam didn't take a plane (since if Sam took a plane, Erin would have taken a train).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
