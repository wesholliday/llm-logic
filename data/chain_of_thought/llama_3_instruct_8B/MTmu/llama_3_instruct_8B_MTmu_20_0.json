This implies that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow.\n3. However, we are given a new statement: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\".\n4. This means that the banana does not necessarily have to be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the original statement again: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\". If the apple is indeed red, then the banana would need to be yellow according to this statement.\n5. But we just established that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (from step 4).\n6. This means that the original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" cannot be true if the apple is indeed red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
