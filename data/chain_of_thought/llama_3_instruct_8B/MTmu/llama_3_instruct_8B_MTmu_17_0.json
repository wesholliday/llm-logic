This implies that there is a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad.\n3. If Ben eats pasta, then according to the statement, Kate must eat the salad.\n4. However, we are given an additional statement: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad\".\n5. This means that Kate does not necessarily eat the salad when Ben eats pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion we want to infer: \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\n6. If Ben did not eat pasta, then there is no need for us to consider the conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad.\n7. In this case, we cannot conclude anything about Kate's actions (eating or not eating the salad).\n8. However, if Ben did eat pasta, then according to the original statement, Kate must have eaten the salad. But we know that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n9. This means that Ben cannot have eaten pasta, because if he had, Kate would have had to eat the salad.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
