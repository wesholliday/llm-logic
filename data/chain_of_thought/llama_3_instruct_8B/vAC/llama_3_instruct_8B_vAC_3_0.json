Premise 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\nThis premise states that there is an if-then relationship between the book being written by James and the book being a mystery novel.\n\n2. Premise 2: \"The book is a mystery novel\"\nThis premise asserts that the book indeed belongs to the genre of mystery novels.\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The book was written by James\"\nThe conclusion attempts to infer that the book was written by James based on the premises.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the correct logical structure. A valid argument must have a true conclusion if its premises are true.\n\nIn this case, if both premises are true (i.e., the book being written by James implies it's a mystery novel, and indeed it is), then the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" logically follows.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
