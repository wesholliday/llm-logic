            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\nThis premise is stating a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue being at the wedding.\n2. Premise 2: \"Sue was at the wedding\"\nThis premise is providing evidence that Sue indeed attended the wedding.\n3. Conclusion: \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This implies a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance.\nFrom Premise 2, we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's combine these two pieces of information: If Mary was at the wedding (as stated in Premise 1), then Sue would be at the wedding (as stated in Premise 2). Since we already know Sue was at the wedding, it logically follows that if Mary was at the wedding, she would also be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises. The argument is valid because the conclusion is necessarily true given the truth of the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
