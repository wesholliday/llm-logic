This is an if-then statement, which can be read as a conditional statement.\n2. The second premise states \"The mummy was awake\".\n3. The conclusion states \"The vampire was awake\".\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\nFrom the second premise, we know that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\nUsing modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude that:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\nThe mummy was awake\n\nTherefore, it follows logically that:\n\nThe vampire was awake\n\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
