This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n   P \u2192 Q (If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled)\n   where P = \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q = \"the zinger was smoogled\"\n3. Now, we want to infer the statement \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\".\n4. This can be rewritten as:\n   \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled)\n5. To infer this statement from the original one, we need to apply the contrapositive rule.\n6. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n7. Since the original statement is already in the form P \u2192 Q, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
