Negating the consequent (\"plopped the frink\") gives us \"did not plop the frink\". Negating the antecedent (\"sploffed\") gives us \"was not sploffed\".\n\nThe negated statement would be:\n\n\"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original one. If the grommet being sploffed implies it plopping the frink, then not plopping the frink implies not being sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
