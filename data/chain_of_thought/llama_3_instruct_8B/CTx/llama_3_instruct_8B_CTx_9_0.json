If the twonk is not varnished (the negation of \"it was varnished\"), and if it's true that the twonk being not varnished implies the twonk being not plinked, then we can conclude that:\n\n\"If the twonk was not plinked\"\n\nThis inference is valid because the original statement only mentioned a direct relationship between being plinked and being varnished. It didn't provide any information about what happens when neither of these conditions is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
