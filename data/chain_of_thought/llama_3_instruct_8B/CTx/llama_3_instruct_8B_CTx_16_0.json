Negating the antecedent gives us:\n\n\"If the sneg was NOT crampled\"\n\nNegating the consequent gives us:\n\n\"then the sneg DID NOT sproted the frink\"\n\nNow, we can rephrase the inferred statement as:\n\n\"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original one. If the sneg didn't sproted the frink, it means the condition \"crampled\" must have been false (since the consequent didn't occur). Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg was indeed NOT crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
