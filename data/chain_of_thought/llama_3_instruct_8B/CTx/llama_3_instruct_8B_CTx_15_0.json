This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n   P \u2192 Q (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended)\n3. Where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spended\".\n\nNow, we want to infer another statement: \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\". This can be rewritten as:\n   \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed)\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, we need to check if it follows logically from the original statement.\n\n4. Using the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the original statement as:\n   \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If the dreb was not spended, then the dreb was not vroombed)\n5. This is exactly what we want to infer! Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
