This statement implies that being snurgled is a sufficient condition for something to be crinked.\n3. Now, we want to infer the converse: \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\".\n4. To do this, we need to show that being non-crinked is a necessary condition for something to be non-snurgled.\n\nHowever, the original statement only implies that being snurgled is sufficient for being crinked, but it does not imply that being non-crinked is necessary for being non-snurgled. There could be other reasons why the fribble did not crink, unrelated to whether it was snurgled or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
