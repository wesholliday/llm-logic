This would give us:\n\n\"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\"\n\nThis new statement is logically equivalent to the original one. It's saying that if the wug didn't meet the condition of being flooped, it also didn't meet the consequence of bimming the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
