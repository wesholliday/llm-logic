This implies that being plooked is a sufficient condition for being nugged.\n3. In other words, if something is plooked, we can conclude that it is also nugged.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite: \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\".\n\n1. This statement implies that being not nugged is a necessary condition for being not plooked.\n2. Since being plooked is sufficient for being nugged (from step 3), it means that if something is not nugged, it cannot be plooked either.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
