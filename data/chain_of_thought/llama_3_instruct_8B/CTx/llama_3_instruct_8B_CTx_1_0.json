This implies that being blimmed is a sufficient condition for being zargled.\n3. Now, we want to infer the converse: \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\".\n4. To do this, we need to show that being not zargled is a necessary condition for being not blimmed.\n\nSince we only have one implication in the original statement (blimmed implies zargled), we cannot conclude that not being zargled implies not being blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
