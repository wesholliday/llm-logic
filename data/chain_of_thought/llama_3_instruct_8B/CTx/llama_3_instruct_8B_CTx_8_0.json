The original statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\nThis means that if the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true, then the condition \"the sprocket was daggled\" must also be true.\n\n2. We want to infer a new statement: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\"\nThis means that if the condition \"the sprocket was not daggled\" is true, then the condition \"the sprocket was not cranked\" must also be true.\n\n3. To infer this new statement, we need to use the original statement and its inverse (i.e., the contrapositive).\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked\"\nThis is because if the condition \"the sprocket was not daggled\" is true, then the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" must be false.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.\nAnswer: yes",
