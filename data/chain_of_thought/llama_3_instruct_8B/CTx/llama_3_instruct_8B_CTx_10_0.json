The arrow (\u2192) indicates implication.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite:\n\n\"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\"\n\nTo do this, we need to negate both sides of the original statement:\n\n\"Not Garpled \u2192 Not Sproinged\"\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that if the wug is not garpled, then it cannot be sproinged. The arrow (\u2192) still indicates implication.\n\nSince the original statement implies that being sproinged means being garpled, and we've negated both sides, this new statement is indeed true: if the wug is not garpled, then it must also not be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
