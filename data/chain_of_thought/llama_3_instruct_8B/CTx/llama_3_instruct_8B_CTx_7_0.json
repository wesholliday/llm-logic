This implies that there is a relationship between being shanked and tinking.\n3. Specifically, it suggests that if something is shanked, it will also tinker.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n4. If we assume that the original statement holds true, then we can infer that if the whiffle does not tinker, it cannot be shanked.\n5. This is because the original statement implies that being shanked is a necessary condition for tinking.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
