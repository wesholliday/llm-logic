The statement implies that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it will surn.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite:\n\n\"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\nTo do this, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent. Negating the antecedent gives us \"the fleeg was not bluttered\", which is a possible scenario. However, negating the consequent (\"it did not surn\") does not necessarily imply that the original condition (\"bluttered\") is false.\n\nIn other words, just because the fleeg didn't surn doesn't mean it wasn't bluttered in the first place. There could be other reasons why it didn't surn, unrelated to being bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the opposite statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
