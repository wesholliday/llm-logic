This implies that being morphed is a sufficient condition for something to quank.\n3. Now, we want to infer the converse: \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\".\n4. To do this, we need to show that if the splat did not quank, it cannot be morphed.\n\nFrom step 2, we know that being morphed is sufficient for something to quank. This means that if the splat is morphed, it will quank.\n5. Now, suppose the splat does not quank. Then, by the given statement, it cannot be morphed (since being morphed would imply quanking).\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
