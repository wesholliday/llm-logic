This statement implies that being blummed and being zimmed are equivalent conditions.\n3. If we negate both parts of the original statement, we get: \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\".\n4. Since being blummed and being zimmed are equivalent conditions, if the flug is not blummed, it cannot bezimmed.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
