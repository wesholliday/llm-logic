            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: If Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is at the wedding.\n2. The second premise states \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\". This implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain or possible but not guaranteed.\n3. The conclusion states \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to examine how the premises relate to each other and whether they support the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. If Mary is present, then Sue must be present. However, the second premise introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence, which does not directly affect Mary's presence.\n\nThe conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" seems to be an inference based on the second premise (\"Sue might not have been at the wedding\"), but it doesn't follow logically from the first premise or the combination of both premises. The argument is trying to conclude something about Mary's presence solely based on Sue's uncertain presence, which is not a valid logical connection.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: no",
