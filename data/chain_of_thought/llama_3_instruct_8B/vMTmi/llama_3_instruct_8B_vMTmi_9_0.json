            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: If Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt.\n2. The second premise states that \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\", which implies that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n3. The conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises logically entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. However, from premise 2, we also know that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\nThis means that it's possible for Lisa to buy the red shirt and Mark not to buy the blue shirt.\n\nBut this does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. There could be other possibilities where Lisa buys the red shirt, and Mark still doesn't buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" solely based on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
