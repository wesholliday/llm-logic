This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"If ~C (not cotton), then ~D (not denim)\".\n2. The second premise is \"The pants might not have been denim\", which can be rewritten as \"~D\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The shirt was not cotton\", which can be rewritten as \"~C\".\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the conclusion from the premises:\n\n1. From the first premise, we get: If ~C then ~D\n2. We are given: ~D (from the second premise)\n3. Using modus tollens (a valid logical rule), we can infer: ~C\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because it follows a valid logical structure:\n\nIf ~C then ~D\n~D\n\u2234 ~C\n\nAnswer: yes",
