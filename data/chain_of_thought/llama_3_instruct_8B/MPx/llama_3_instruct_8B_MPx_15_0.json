From the second premise, we know that the dreb was indeed vroombed.\n3. Now, let's apply the first premise to this new information: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\"\n4. Since we know the dreb was vroombed (from the second premise), we can conclude that it satisfies the condition in the first premise.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was indeed spended.\n\nAnswer: yes",
