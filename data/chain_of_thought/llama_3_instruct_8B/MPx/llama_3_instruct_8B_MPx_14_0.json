The first statement is an if-then statement, which means that if the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, then the conclusion \"the clug snugged\" must also be true.\n3. We are given additional information: \"The clug was fleeked\".\n4. Since we know that the clug was indeed fleeked (from statement 2), we can apply the if-then rule from statement 1.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
