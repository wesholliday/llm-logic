Since the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the wug was sproinged\") is already known to be true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\n\"If it's true that the wug was sproinged, then it must also be true that it was garpled\"\n\nGiven that we know the wug was indeed sproinged, we can confidently say that it was also garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
