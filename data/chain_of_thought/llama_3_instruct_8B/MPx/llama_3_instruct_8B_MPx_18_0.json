From statement (2), we know that the shank was indeed plooked.\n3. Now, let's look at statement (1). It says \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it implies a relationship between two events: being plooked and being nugged.\n4. Since we know that the shank was indeed plooked (from statement 2), we can apply the condition in statement (1). If the shank was plooked, then it must be true that the shank was also nugged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shank was indeed nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
