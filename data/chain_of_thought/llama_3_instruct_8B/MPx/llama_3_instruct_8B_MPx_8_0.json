We have two statements:\n\t* If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled (conditional statement)\n\t* The sprocket was cranked (additional information)\n\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the sprocket is indeed cranked, it must also be daggled.\n\n3. Since we have additional information stating that \"The sprocket was cranked\", we can apply this to the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that since the sprocket was cranked (as stated), it must also be daggled (according to the conditional statement).\n\nAnswer: yes",
