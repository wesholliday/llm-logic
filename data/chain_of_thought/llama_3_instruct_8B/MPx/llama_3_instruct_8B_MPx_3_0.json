From the first statement, we can infer that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n3. Since we have a second statement \"The splat was morphed\", which confirms the truth of the condition, we can apply the inference rule to conclude that:\n\t* If the splat was morphed (true), then the splat quanked (must be true).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the conclusion \"the splat quanked\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
