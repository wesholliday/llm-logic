We have two statements:\n\t* If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked (conditional statement)\n\t* The fribble was snurgled (additional information)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the condition \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, then the consequence \"the fribble crinked\" must also be true.\n\n3. Now, we have additional information that confirms the condition: \"The fribble was snurgled\".\n\n4. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble crinked\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
