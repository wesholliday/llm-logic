The categorical statement tells us that the sneg was indeed crampled, which means we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation.\n\nSince the antecedent of the conditional statement is true (the sneg was crampled), we can conclude that the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can infer:\n\n\"The sneg sproted the frink\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
