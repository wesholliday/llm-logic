The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the consequent (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n\n3. We know that the second statement \"The whiffle was shanked\" is true, since it's given as a premise.\n\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation: if the whiffle was indeed shanked (which it is), then it must have tinked.\n\n5. Since the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, and the consequent follows logically from it, we can infer that the whiffle tinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
