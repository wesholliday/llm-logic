We have two statements:\n\t* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" (conditional statement)\n\t* \"The grommet was sploffed\" (assertion)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the antecedent (\"the grommet was sploffed\") is true, then the consequent (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") must also be true.\n\n3. We are given the assertion \"The grommet was sploffed\", which means we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is indeed true.\n\n4. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement implies that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, we can infer that the consequent (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
