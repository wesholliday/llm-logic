We have two statements:\n\t* If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (conditional statement)\n\t* The zinger was fraggled (assertion)\n\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the antecedent (\"the zinger was fraggled\") is true, then the consequent (\"the zinger was smoogled\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we have an assertion \"The zinger was fraggled\", which matches the antecedent of the conditional statement, we can apply modus ponens (a rule of inference) to conclude that:\n\n\t* If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\n\t* The zinger was fraggled\n\n\tTherefore, by modus ponens, we can infer:\n\n\t* The zinger was smoogled\n\nAnswer: yes",
