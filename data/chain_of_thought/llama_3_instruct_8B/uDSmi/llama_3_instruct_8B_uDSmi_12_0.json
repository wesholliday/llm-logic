The statement \"the jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the jacket could be draped over the chair because if it's not hanging in the closet (which is possible), then it must be draped over the chair (since it's either one of those two options).\n\nAnswer: yes",
