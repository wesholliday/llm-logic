The missing sock might not be under the bed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities for the location of the missing sock: either it's in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the possibility of the sock being under the bed is not exclusive. In other words, it's possible that the sock is neither under the bed nor in the laundry basket.\n\nHowever, since there are only two possibilities mentioned in statement 1, and one of them (being under the bed) has been ruled out as a possibility by statement 2, we can conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
