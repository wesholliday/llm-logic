The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the cookies: the jar and the pantry.\n2. The additional information \"Also, the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" suggests that it's possible that the cookies are not actually hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar (since there are only two possibilities). Therefore, we can conclude that if the cookies are not in the pantry, they are likely to be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
