This creates an exhaustive list of options.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the newspaper might not be on the porch. This doesn't provide any new information about the driveway; it simply adds a possibility to the original list (the newspaper might not be on the porch, but it could still be in the driveway).\n\nSince we have an exhaustive list of possibilities and one of them is \"the newspaper is in the driveway\", we can conclude that the statement \"the newspaper is in the driveway\" must be true. If it weren't true, then the newspaper would either be on the porch (which we know might not be the case) or there would be some other possibility that we haven't considered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
