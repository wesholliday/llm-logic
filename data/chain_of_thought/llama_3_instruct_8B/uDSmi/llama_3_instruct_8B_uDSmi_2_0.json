Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis statement provides two mutually exclusive options for the book's location.\n\n2. The book might not be resting on the table.\nThis statement adds a new possibility, which is that the book is not on the table.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* The book cannot be both on the shelf and resting on the table (since they are mutually exclusive).\n* The book might not be resting on the table, but it could still be on the shelf.\n* There is no information that suggests the book must be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf. We can only conclude that it's possible, but not definite.\n\nAnswer: no",
