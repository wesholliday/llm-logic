The statement \"the watch might not be on his wrist\" implies that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the watch could be on his wrist, but we cannot infer with certainty whether it's charging on the dresser or not. The only thing we know for sure is that it's either on his wrist or charging on the dresser, but we don't have any additional information to determine which one is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
