The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities for the location of the milk: it's either on the counter or in the fridge (chilling).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the possibility of the milk being in the fridge is not certain. It \"might\" not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's combine this information:\n\nIf the milk is not in the fridge (as stated in statement 2), then it must be on the counter (according to statement 1). This is because there are only two possibilities for the location of the milk, and one of them has been eliminated (the possibility that it's in the fridge).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
