The statement says \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\" This implies that there are only two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece.\n2. The second part of the statement says \"Also, the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\" This adds an additional possibility to the original two: the missing puzzle piece is neither in the box nor blending in on the floor.\n\nHowever, this new information doesn't change the fact that there are still only two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it's either in the box or not. Since we know that one of these options must be true (the missing puzzle piece is somewhere), we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
