The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" implies that there are only two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses.\n2. The second part of the statement \"Also, the sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" adds a new piece of information, which is that it's possible the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n3. From this, we can conclude that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag (since there are only two possibilities).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
