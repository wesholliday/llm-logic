Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the shelf.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the toy box and the shelf.\n\n2. The toy might not be sitting on the shelf.\nThis statement adds a new piece of information, which is that the toy's presence on the shelf is uncertain.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* If the toy is not on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box (since there are only two possible locations).\n* However, since we don't know for sure whether the toy is on the shelf or not, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, Answer: no",
