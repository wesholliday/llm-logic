Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the remote control is on the coffee table, or it is not on the coffee table but instead hiding under the couch.\n\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\nThis statement adds a new possibility: the remote control is neither on the coffee table nor hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that there are three possible locations for the remote control:\n\n* On the coffee table\n* Hiding under the couch\n* Neither of the above (i.e., it's somewhere else)\n\nSince we don't have any additional information to rule out the third possibility, we cannot infer with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no",
