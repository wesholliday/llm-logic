Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\nThis statement presents two mutually exclusive options: the umbrella is either in the car or it's not, and if it's not, then it must be in the closet.\n\n2. The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\nThis statement adds a new possibility to the mix: the umbrella could be somewhere other than the closet (or even nowhere at all).\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know that either the umbrella is in the car or it must be in the closet, and we also know that it might not be in the closet, we can conclude that there's a possibility the umbrella is indeed in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
