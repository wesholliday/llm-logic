Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement tells us that there are only two possible locations for the notebook: the drawer and the nightstand.\n\n2. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement adds a new piece of information, which is that the notebook's presence on the nightstand is uncertain or unknown.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* The notebook must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand (from statement 1).\n* We don't know for sure if it's on the nightstand (from statement 2).\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer. There's a possibility that it might actually be sitting on the nightstand, even though we can't confirm it.\n\nAnswer: no",
