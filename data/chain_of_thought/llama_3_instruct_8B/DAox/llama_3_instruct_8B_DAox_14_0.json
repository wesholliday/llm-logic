The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the clug being fleeked) is true, then the consequence (the clug snugging) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The clug was not fleeked\" (from the first statement), this means that the condition in the second statement is false.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the consequence (the clug snugging) is true or false, because the condition is not met.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The clug was not snugged\". We can't directly use the information from the first statement (\"The clug was not fleeked\") to conclude anything about whether the clug snugged or not. The second statement only tells us what happens if the clug is fleeked, but we know that's not the case.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The clug was not snugged\".\n\nAnswer: no",
