We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The grommet did not sploff\"\n\t* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n2. From the first statement, we know that the grommet did not sploff.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then another statement (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n4. Since we know from step 2 that the grommet did not sploff, the condition in the second statement is false.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion of the second statement (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") cannot be inferred.\n\nAnswer: no",
