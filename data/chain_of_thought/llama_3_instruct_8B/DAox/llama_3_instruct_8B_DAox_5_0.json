The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the conclusion (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The zinger was not fraggled\", this means that the condition in the second statement is false.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the zinger is smoogled, because the condition for smoogling (fraggliness) is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
