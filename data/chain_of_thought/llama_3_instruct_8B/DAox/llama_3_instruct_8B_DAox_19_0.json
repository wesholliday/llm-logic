The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smonk being vreebled) is true, then the consequence (the smonk plagging) must also be true.\n3. We are given that the smonk was not vreebled, which means the condition of the second statement is false.\n4. Since the condition is false, we cannot conclude that the smonk plagged or did not plagge.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer something about the smonk's plagging status. If the smonk was not vreebled, then it must be true that the smonk was not plagged (because if it were plagged, it would have been vreebled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
