The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that the shank was not plooked (from the first statement), this means that the antecedent of the second statement is false.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shank was nugged, because the conditional statement only guarantees that if the shank were plooked, it would be nugged.\n\nAnswer: no",
