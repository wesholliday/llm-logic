We have two statements:\n\t* \"The wug did not floop\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition is met (the wug being flooped), then something else will happen (the wug bimming the zoint).\n3. We don't know whether the wug was actually flooped or not.\n4. However, we do know that Statement A says \"The wug did not floop\", which means it's impossible for the wug to be flooped.\n5. Since the condition in Statement B (the wug being flooped) is impossible, the consequence of that condition (the wug bimming the zoint) cannot happen either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug did not bim the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
