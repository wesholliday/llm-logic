The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that the sprocket was not cranked (from the first statement), we can conclude that the antecedent of the second statement is false (i.e., \"the sprocket was cranked\" is not true).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that the consequent (\"the sprocket was daggled\") must be true or false, because the condition under which it would be true (i.e., \"the sprocket was cranked\") is not met.\n5. Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the sprocket was daggled or not, we cannot infer that it was not daggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
