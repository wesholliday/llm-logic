The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the glip being slogged) is true, then the conclusion (the glip being tragged) must also be true.\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the condition \"The glip was not slogged\" is actually false. This means that the condition in the second statement cannot be true.\n4. Since the condition in the second statement cannot be true, we cannot conclude that the conclusion (the glip being tragged) must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The glip was not tragged\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
