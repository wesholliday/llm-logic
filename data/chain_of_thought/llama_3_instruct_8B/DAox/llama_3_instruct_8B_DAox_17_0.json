The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The flob was not skizzled\", this means that the antecedent of the second statement (\"If the flob was skizzled\") is false.\n4. As a result, we cannot conclude that the consequent (\"then the flob movated\") is true or false, because the condition is not met.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the flob was movated or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
