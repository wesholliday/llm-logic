The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanking) will also be true.\n3. Since we know that the splat was not morphed (from the first statement), we can conclude that the condition in the second statement is false.\n4. Therefore, the consequence of the second statement (the splat quanking) does not apply to our situation.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat did not quank\". We only know that the splat was not morphed and therefore did not quank due to being morphed. However, there could be other reasons why the splat quanked or didn't quank.\n\nAnswer: no",
