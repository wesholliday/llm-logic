This means that the condition specified in statement 2 (i.e., the fleeg being bluttered) does not hold true.\n\nSince the condition does not hold, we cannot conclude that the fleeg will necessarily surn. In other words, we cannot infer that the fleeg did surn.\n\nTherefore, we can only infer that the conclusion \"The fleeg did not surn\" is possible but not certain. We cannot definitively say whether the fleeg did or did not surn.\n\nAnswer: no",
