We have two statements:\n\t* \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (\"the dreb was vroombed\") is true, then the consequent (\"the dreb was spened\") must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (Statement A), this means that the antecedent of Statement B is false.\n4. If the antecedent is false, then the consequent cannot be inferred to be true or false. In other words, we cannot conclude whether the dreb was spened or not based solely on these two statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
