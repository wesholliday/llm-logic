It says that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nNow, let's look at statement (2). It says that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies when the condition (the wug being sproinged) is true.\n\nSince we know from statement (1) that the wug was not sproinged, we can conclude that the condition in statement (2) is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug was garpled.\n\nHowever, we can use this information to make a new inference. Since the wug was not sproinged, and if it were sproinged, then it would be garpled, we can conclude that the wug being garpled is dependent on the condition of being sproinged. Therefore, since the wug was not sproinged, we cannot infer that it was garpled.\n\nAnswer: no",
