The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flug being blummed) is true, then the consequence (the flug being zimmed) must also be true.\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the condition \"The flug was not blummed\" is true.\n4. Since the condition is false, the consequence \"The flug was zimmed\" cannot be inferred to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: no",
