We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* The book is a mystery novel (fact)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. Now, we have the fact that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\n4. Since the book is a mystery novel, and from step 2, we know that if it was written by James, it would be a mystery novel, we can conclude that:\n\n\t* The book being a mystery novel implies that it was written by James (modus ponens)\n\n5. Therefore, we can deduce that the book was indeed written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
