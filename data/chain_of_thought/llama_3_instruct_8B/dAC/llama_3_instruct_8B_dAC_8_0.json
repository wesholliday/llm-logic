We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The mummy was awake (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n3. Since we know from the factual statement that the mummy is indeed awake, it means that the condition in the conditional statement is fulfilled.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was awake, as stated in the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
