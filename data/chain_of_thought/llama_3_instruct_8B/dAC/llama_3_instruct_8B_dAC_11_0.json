From statement 2, we know that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it only becomes true if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is met.\n\n4. Since we know that the muffins are indeed blueberry (from statement 2), this implies that the condition in statement 1 must be true. In other words, the cake must have been chocolate for the muffins to be blueberry.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
