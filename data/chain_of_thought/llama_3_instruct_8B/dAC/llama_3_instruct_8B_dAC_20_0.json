We have two statements:\n\t* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (conditional statement)\n\t* The banana was yellow (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow.\n3. Now, we have a factual statement saying that the banana is indeed yellow.\n4. Since the banana being yellow is consistent with the condition in the original conditional statement, we can conclude that the apple might be red.\n\nHowever, there's a crucial limitation: we cannot directly deduce that the apple was red from the given information. The conditional statement only provides a necessary condition (if the apple is red), but not a sufficient condition (the apple must be red).\n\nTherefore, Answer: no",
