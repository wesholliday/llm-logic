The conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" implies that if Ben ate pasta, Kate would eat salad.\n\n3. The fact \"Kate ate salad\" tells us that Kate did indeed eat salad.\n\n4. However, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta from these statements alone. We only know that Kate ate salad, but we don't have any information about Ben's eating habits.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot deduce \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
