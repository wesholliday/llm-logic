From the second statement, we know that Bob indeed chose pasta.\n3. Now, let's focus on the first statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only becomes true if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is met.\n4. Since we don't have any information about Sue's choice, we can't conclude that she actually chose pizza.\n5. Even if Bob chose pasta, it doesn't necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. There could be other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot deduce that \"Sue chose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: no",
