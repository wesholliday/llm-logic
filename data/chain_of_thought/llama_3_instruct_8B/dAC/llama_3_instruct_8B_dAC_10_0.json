From statement 2, we know that the cat is indeed outside.\n\n3. Now, let's focus on statement 1: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition (the dog being inside) is true, then another condition (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we already know from statement 2 that the cat is indeed outside, this part of the conditional statement is satisfied.\n\n5. However, just because the cat is outside doesn't necessarily mean the dog was inside. The original conditional statement only guarantees that if the dog is inside, then the cat will be outside. It doesn't guarantee that the dog is actually inside.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot deduce with certainty that \"The dog was inside\" from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
