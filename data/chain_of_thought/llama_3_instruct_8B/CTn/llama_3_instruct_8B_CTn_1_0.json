This statement implies that there is a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n3. Specifically, it suggests that if Mary is present, Sue cannot be present (and vice versa).\n4. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\".\n5. This statement would also imply a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n6. However, this relationship is the opposite of what we inferred from the original statement (step 3).\n7. Since the relationships are opposite, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
