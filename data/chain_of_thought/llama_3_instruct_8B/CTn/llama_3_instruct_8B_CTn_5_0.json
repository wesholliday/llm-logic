This statement implies that there is an inverse relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n3. However, this does not necessarily imply a direct relationship between Amy playing tennis and Jeff not playing basketball.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Amy plays tennis regardless of whether Jeff plays basketball or not. The original statement only tells us what happens when Jeff plays basketball, but doesn't provide information about the converse scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
