This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris not finishing the race) must also be true.\n2. We want to know if we can infer the converse of this statement: \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race\".\n3. To determine if we can make this inference, let's consider what would happen if Chris did finish the race.\n\nIf Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex didn't finish the race. There are many possible scenarios where both Alex and Chris could have finished the race.\n4. However, if Alex did not finish the race, then we know from the original statement that Chris must have also not finished the race (since \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race\").\n5. But this doesn't mean that if Chris finished the race, then Alex didn't finish the race. We can't conclude that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the original statement: \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: no",
