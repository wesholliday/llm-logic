This statement implies that if the book was written by James, it cannot be a mystery novel.\n3. We want to infer the converse of this statement, which would be: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\"\n4. To do this, we need to use the principle of contraposition, which states that if P implies Q, then \u00acQ implies \u00acP.\n5. In our case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is not a mystery novel\".\n6. Using contraposition, we can infer that if \u00acQ (i.e., the book is a mystery novel), then \u00acP (i.e., the book was not written by James).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
