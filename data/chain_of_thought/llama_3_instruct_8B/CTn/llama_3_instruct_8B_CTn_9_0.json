This implies that if Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark cannot buy the blue shirt at the same time.\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n4. If Mark buys the blue shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. There could be other possibilities where both events occur or neither occurs.\n5. However, if we assume that the original statement is true, and Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark not buying the blue shirt, then we can infer that if Mark buys the blue shirt, it's likely that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
