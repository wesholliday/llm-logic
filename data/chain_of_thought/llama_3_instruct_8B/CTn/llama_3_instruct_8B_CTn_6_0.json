This statement implies that if Sue chooses pizza, Bob cannot choose pasta at the same time.\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n4. We can rephrase this statement as \"If it is not true that Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n5. Since we know that if Sue chooses pizza, Bob cannot choose pasta (from step 2), we can conclude that if Bob chooses pasta, Sue must have chosen something other than pizza.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that if Bob chose pasta, Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
