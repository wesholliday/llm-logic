This implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants cannot be denim.\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\".\n4. To infer this statement from the original one, we need to show that if the pants are denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n5. From the original statement, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are not denim.\n6. This means that if the pants are denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton (since they can't both be true at the same time).\n7.
