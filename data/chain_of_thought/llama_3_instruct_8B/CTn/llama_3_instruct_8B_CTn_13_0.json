This statement implies that if the car is indeed red, then the truck cannot be blue.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the truck is blue, then the car must be non-red.\n\nThe key point here is that we are dealing with a conditional statement, and the converse of the original statement is not necessarily true. Just because \"if the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" implies that the car cannot be red when the truck is blue, it does not mean that if the truck is blue, then the car must be non-red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: no",
