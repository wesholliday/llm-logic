This statement implies that there is a direct relationship between the states of being awake for the vampire and the mummy.\n3. Specifically, it suggests that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy cannot be awake at the same time.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\n4. We can see that this statement is trying to establish a similar relationship between the states of being awake for the mummy and the vampire.\n5. However, we cannot directly conclude that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must be asleep (or \"not awake\").\n6. The original statement only provides information about what happens when the vampire is awake, not what happens when the mummy is awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the opposite statement with certainty. There might be other possibilities where both the vampire and the mummy are awake or asleep simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no",
