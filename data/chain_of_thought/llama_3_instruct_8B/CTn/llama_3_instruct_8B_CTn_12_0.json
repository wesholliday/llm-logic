This statement implies that there is a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy not going to the zoo.\n3. However, this statement does not provide any information about what would happen if Lucy went to the zoo or if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nTo infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\", we need additional information that links Lucy's action (going to the zoo) with Joe's action (not going to the park).\n\nSince there is no such information provided in the original statement, we cannot make this inference. The given statement only provides a relationship between Joe and Lucy's actions when they are both at different locations (park and zoo), but it does not provide any information about what would happen if one of them changes their action.\n\nAnswer: no",
