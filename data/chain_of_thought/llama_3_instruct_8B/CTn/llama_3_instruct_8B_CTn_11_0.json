This statement implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be non-chocolate.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but it doesn't provide any information about the reverse relationship.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
