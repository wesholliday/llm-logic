This statement implies that there is a relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n3. Specifically, it suggests that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf cannot be in the den at the same time.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\".\n\n4. This statement implies that there is a relationship between the wolf being in the den and the bear being in the cave.\n5. Specifically, it suggests that if the wolf is in the den, then the bear cannot be in the cave at the same time.\n\n6. Notice that the relationships described in steps 3 and 5 are inverse of each other: if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den; and if the wolf is in the den, then the bear is not in the cave.\n7. This suggests that the original statement and its converse are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
