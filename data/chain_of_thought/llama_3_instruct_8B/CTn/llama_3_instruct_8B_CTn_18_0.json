This statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be metal.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the truck is metal, then the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nIn other words, just because the doll being plastic rules out the possibility of the truck being metal, it doesn't mean that the truck being metal would necessarily rule out the possibility of the doll being plastic.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the doll is actually made of wood and the truck is indeed made of metal. In this case, the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\" would be true, but the converse statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck is metal, then the doll was not plastic. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
