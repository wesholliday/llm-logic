            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\t* ? (We want to infer a new statement)\n\n2. To make an inference, we need to use logical rules and manipulate the given information.\n\n3. Notice that the original statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\". This means that if P is true, then Q must be false.\n\n4. We can rewrite the original statement as:\n\t* The griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn not being in the forest.\n\n5. Now, let's try to infer the new statement we want: \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\n6. To do this, we can use a similar logical rule: if Q is true (unicorn is in the forest), then P must be false (griffin is not in the forest).\n\n7. This new statement is also a conditional statement, and it's logically equivalent to the original one.\n\n8. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\t* If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
