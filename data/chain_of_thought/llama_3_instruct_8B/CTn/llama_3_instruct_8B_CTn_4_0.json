This statement implies that there is a relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n3. Specifically, it suggests that if the alien visits Mars, then the robot cannot visit Jupiter (or vice versa).\n4. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\".\n5. This statement is saying that if the robot visits Jupiter, then the alien cannot visit Mars.\n6. Since the original statement implies a relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter, we can infer that this relationship holds in both directions.\n7. Therefore, if the robot visits Jupiter, it means that the alien cannot visit Mars (by the same logic as before).\n\nAnswer: yes",
