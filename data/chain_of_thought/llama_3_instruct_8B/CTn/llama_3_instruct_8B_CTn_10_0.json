This implies that if the dog is inside, the cat cannot be outside.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only provides information about the relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location when the dog is inside. It does not provide any information about what happens when the cat is outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
