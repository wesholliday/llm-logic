This implies that if Sam takes a plane, Erin will not take a train.\n3. Now, we want to infer the converse: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\".\n4. To do this, we need to find a connection between Erin taking a train and Sam not taking a plane.\n\nNotice that there is no direct implication between these two statements. The original statement only talks about Sam's action (taking a plane) and its effect on Erin's action (not taking a train). It doesn't provide any information about the converse scenario, where Erin takes a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
