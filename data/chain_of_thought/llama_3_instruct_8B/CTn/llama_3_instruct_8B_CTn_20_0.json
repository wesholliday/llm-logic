This statement implies that if the apple is red, the banana cannot be yellow.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the banana is yellow, the apple must be non-red.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that when the apple is red, the banana can't be yellow, it doesn't mean that when the banana is yellow, the apple has to be non-red. There could be other possibilities where the apple is not red but still exists.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
