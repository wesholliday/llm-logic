We have two statements:\n\t* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (conditional statement)\n\t* The apple was red (additional information)\n\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the antecedent (\"the apple was red\") is true, then the consequent (\"the banana was yellow\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know that \"The apple was red\" is indeed true (from the additional information), we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation:\n\n\t* If the apple was red (which it is), then the banana was yellow\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the banana was indeed yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
