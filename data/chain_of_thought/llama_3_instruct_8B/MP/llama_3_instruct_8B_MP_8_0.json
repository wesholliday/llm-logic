We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The vampire was awake (additional information)\n\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is true, then the conclusion \"the mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we have additional information that confirms the condition \"the vampire was awake\", we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
