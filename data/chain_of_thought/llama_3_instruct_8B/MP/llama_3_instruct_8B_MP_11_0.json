From statement (2), we can conclude that the cake is indeed chocolate.\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only becomes true if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is met.\n4. Since we've already established that the cake is indeed chocolate (from statement 2), we can apply the condition to the first statement.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the muffins are blueberry, as stated in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
