            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\n\t* Tom watched football\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that Tom watched football (from the second statement), we can apply the conditional statement to this situation:\n\t* If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\n\t* Tom watched football (true)\n\t* Therefore, Jen watched basketball (consequence follows from the condition being true)\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
