The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. We know that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is indeed true, as stated in the second statement.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo.\n5. Since we know that Joe did go to the park, we can infer that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
