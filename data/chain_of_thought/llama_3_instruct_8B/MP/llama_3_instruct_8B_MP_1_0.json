We have two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Mary was at the wedding (fact)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if Mary is indeed at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding.\n\n3. Since we know that Mary was at the wedding (from the fact), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n\t* Mary was at the wedding\n\n4. By combining these two statements, we can infer that Sue must also be at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
