We have two statements:\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (conditional statement)\n\t* Lisa bought the red shirt (fact)\n\n2. From the fact \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement is true: Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\n3.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
