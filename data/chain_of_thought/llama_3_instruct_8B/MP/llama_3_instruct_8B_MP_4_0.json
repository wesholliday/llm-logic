We have two statements:\n\t* If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (conditional statement)\n\t* The alien visited Mars (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the antecedent (\"the alien visited Mars\") is true, then the consequent (\"the robot visited Jupiter\") must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The alien visited Mars\" is indeed true (given in the factual statement), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* The robot visited Jupiter\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
