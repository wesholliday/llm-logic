We have two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (conditional statement)\n\t* Alex finished the race (fact)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if a certain condition is met (Alex finishing the race), then another event will occur (Chris finishing the race).\n\n3. Since we know that Alex finished the race (from the fact), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that Chris also finished the race.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
