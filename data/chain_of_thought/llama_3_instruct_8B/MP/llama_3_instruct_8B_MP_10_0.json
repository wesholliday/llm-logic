From statement (2), we can conclude that the dog is indeed inside.\n3. Now, let's apply the conditional statement from (1). Since the dog is inside, it means \"the dog was inside\" is true.\n4. According to the conditional statement, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This implies that the cat being outside is a necessary consequence of the dog being inside.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the cat was indeed outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
