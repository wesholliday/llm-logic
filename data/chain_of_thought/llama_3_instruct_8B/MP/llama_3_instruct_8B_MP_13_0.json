We have two statements:\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (conditional statement)\n\t* The car was red (additional information)\n\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue.\n\n3. Since we know that \"The car was red\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue\n\t* The car was red (given)\n\t* Therefore, the truck was blue\n\n4. Our conclusion is supported by the original conditional statement and the additional information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
