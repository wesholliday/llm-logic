            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (conditional statement)\n\t* The griffin was in the forest (fact)\n\n2. From the second premise, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true: \"The griffin was in the forest\" implies \"If the griffin was in the forest\".\n\n3. Now, we need to apply the conditional statement to this new information. Since the antecedent is true, we can infer the consequent:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\n\t* The griffin was in the forest (true)\n\t* Therefore, the unicorn was in the forest\n\n4. Our conclusion matches the original question: \"Can we infer 'The unicorn was in the forest'?\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
