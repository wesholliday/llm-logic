We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\t* The book was written by James.\n\n2. From statement (2), we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (the \"if\" clause) is true: the book was indeed written by James.\n\n3. Since the antecedent is true, we can apply modus ponens to infer the consequent:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\t* The book was written by James\n\t\u2234 The book is a mystery novel\n\n4. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
