The first statement is an if-then statement, which means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n3. We know that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is indeed true, since we have the second statement \"Sam took a plane\".\n4. Therefore, by applying the if-then rule, we can conclude that the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
