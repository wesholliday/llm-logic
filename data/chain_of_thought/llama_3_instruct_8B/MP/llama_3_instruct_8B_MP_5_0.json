The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation: since Jeff did play basketball, it follows that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
