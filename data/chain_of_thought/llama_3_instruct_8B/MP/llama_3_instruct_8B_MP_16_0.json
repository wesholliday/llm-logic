From statement (2), we can conclude that the shirt is indeed made of cotton.\n3. Now, let's look at statement (1). It says \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true.\n4. Since we've already established that the shirt is indeed made of cotton (from statement 2), we can apply the conditional statement (1).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the pants were denim, since the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
