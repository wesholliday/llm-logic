We have two statements:\n\t* If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (conditional statement)\n\t* The bear was in the cave (fact)\n\n2. From the fact \"The bear was in the cave\", we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is true: the bear is indeed in the cave.\n\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer the consequence:\n\t* If the bear was in the cave (true), then the wolf was in the den\n\n4. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
