Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possibilities for the location of the pen: either it's in the bag or it's on the desk.\n\n2. It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\nThis statement negates the possibility that the pen is definitely on the desk. However, it doesn't provide any information about whether the pen is actually on the desk or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know that either the pen is in the bag or it's on the desk (from statement 1), and we also know that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk (from statement 2), we can conclude that the pen is indeed in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
