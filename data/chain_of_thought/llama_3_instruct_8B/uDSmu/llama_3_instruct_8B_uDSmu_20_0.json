Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\nThis statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses: either they are in her bag, or they are perched on her head.\n\n2. It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\nThis statement is negating the second possibility mentioned in the first statement. This means that it's not true that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility for the location of the sunglasses is that they are in her bag. Since there is no other option left, we can infer that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
