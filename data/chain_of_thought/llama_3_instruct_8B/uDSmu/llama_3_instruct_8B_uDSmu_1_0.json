It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nFrom statement (1), we know that there are only two possibilities for Fido's location: either he is inside or he must be in the garden.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that it's not possible for Fido to be in the garden. This means that the second possibility from statement (1) is ruled out.\n\nSince one of the possibilities has been eliminated, and the other possibility is still valid (\"Fido is inside\"), we can conclude that Fido must indeed be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
