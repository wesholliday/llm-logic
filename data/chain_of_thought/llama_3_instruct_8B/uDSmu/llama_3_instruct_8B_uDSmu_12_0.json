It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This doesn't necessarily mean it's draped over the chair, but it does leave open the possibility.\n\nSince we know the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet (from statement 1), and we've eliminated one option (hanging in the closet), we can infer that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
