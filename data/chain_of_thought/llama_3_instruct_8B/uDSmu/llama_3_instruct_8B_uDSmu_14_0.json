Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis means that there are only two possibilities for the location of the milk: it's either on the counter or in the fridge.\n\n2. Also, it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement tells us that the second possibility (milk being in the fridge) is actually false. This means that we can eliminate the \"in the fridge\" option.\n\nSince there are only two possibilities and one of them has been eliminated, we can conclude that the remaining possibility must be true:\n\n3. Therefore, the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
