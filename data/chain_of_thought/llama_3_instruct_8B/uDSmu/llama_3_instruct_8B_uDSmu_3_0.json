Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\nThis means that there are only two possibilities for the location of the keys: either they are in the drawer, or they are not in the drawer and instead must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. Also, it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\nThis statement is saying that the second possibility (keys being dangling in the cabinet) is actually false. This means that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the keys are indeed in the drawer. Since it's not possible for them to be dangling in the cabinet, they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
