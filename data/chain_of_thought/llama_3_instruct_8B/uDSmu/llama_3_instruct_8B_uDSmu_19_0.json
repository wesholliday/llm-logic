This doesn't necessarily mean it's charging on the dresser, though.\n\nThe original statement only provides two options: either the watch is charging on the dresser or it's on his wrist. The fact that it's not on his wrist doesn't guarantee that it's charging on the dresser. There could be other possibilities (e.g., it's in a pocket, lost, etc.).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
