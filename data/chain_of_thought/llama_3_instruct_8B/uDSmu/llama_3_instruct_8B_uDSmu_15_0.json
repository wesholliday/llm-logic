It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\nFrom statement (2), we can conclude that the shoes are not necessarily lined up by the door. This means that there is a possibility that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nNow, let's look at statement (1). Since it's either the closet or lined up by the door, and we've already ruled out the latter option, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are indeed in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
