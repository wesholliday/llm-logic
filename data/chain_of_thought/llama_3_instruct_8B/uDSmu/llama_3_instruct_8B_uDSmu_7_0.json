Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\nThis statement presents two mutually exclusive options: the umbrella is either in the car or it's not, and if it's not, then it must be in the closet.\n\n2. Also, it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\nThis statement negates the second option from the first statement, implying that the umbrella might not be in the closet after all.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is indeed in the car. If it weren't in the car, then it would have to be in the closet, but since we know that's not the case, the most likely scenario is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
