It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nFrom statement (2), we can conclude that the missing sock might not be under the bed. However, this doesn't provide any information about whether it's actually in the laundry basket.\n\nStatement (1) provides two possibilities: either the sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed. Since we've already eliminated one possibility (it's not under the bed), we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
