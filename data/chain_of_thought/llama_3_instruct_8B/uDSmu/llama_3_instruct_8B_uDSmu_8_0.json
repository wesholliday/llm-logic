Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\nThis statement presents two mutually exclusive options: either the remote control is on the coffee table, or it's not there and must be hiding under the couch.\n\n2. It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\nThis statement negates the second option presented in the first statement. Since we know it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, this means that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table (since it can't be hiding under the couch).\n\nAnswer: yes",
