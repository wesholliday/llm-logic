Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the notebook: either it's in the drawer or it's on the nightstand.\n\n2. Also, it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement is saying that we can't conclude with certainty that the notebook is on the nightstand. It might be, but we don't have enough information to say for sure.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer. If it weren't in the drawer, then it would have to be on the nightstand, but since we know it's not necessarily on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
