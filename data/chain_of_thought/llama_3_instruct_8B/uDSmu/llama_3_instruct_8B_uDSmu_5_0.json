Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\nThis statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the location of the cookies: either they're in the jar, or they're not and therefore must be in the pantry.\n\n2. It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\nThis statement is negating the second possibility mentioned in the first statement. In other words, it's saying that the cookies are not necessarily hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar. If they weren't in the jar, then they would have to be hidden in the pantry, but since it's not the case that they must be hidden in the pantry, it means that they're actually in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
