It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement (2), we can conclude that the book might not be resting on the table. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it's on the shelf. The book could be in some other location altogether.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to recognize that statement (1) provides a disjunction: either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This means that if we can rule out one option, we can conclude the other option is true.\n\nSince we've already established that the book might not be resting on the table (from statement 2), we can infer that the book must indeed be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
