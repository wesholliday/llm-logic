            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n\t* \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" (\u00ac(Fido is in the garden))\n\t* \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" (\u2203x(Fido is inside \u2228 Fido is in the garden))\n\n2. We can simplify the second premise by applying De Morgan's law to the negation of the first premise:\n\t* \u00ac(Fido is in the garden) \u2192 \u2203x(Fido is not in the garden)\n\t* \u2203x(Fido is inside \u2228 Fido is in the garden) \u2192 \u2203x(Fido is inside \u2228 \u00ac(Fido is in the garden))\n\n3. Now we can combine the two premises using modus ponens:\n\t* \u00ac(Fido is in the garden) \u2227 (\u2203x(Fido is inside \u2228 \u00ac(Fido is in the garden)))\n\t* \u00ac(Fido is in the garden) \u2227 \u2203x(Fido is inside)\n\t* \u2203x(Fido is inside)\n\n4. Finally, we can apply existential instantiation to get a specific instance of Fido being inside:\n\t* Fido is inside\n\nAnswer: yes",
