This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the jacket.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the jacket can't be hanging in the closet. From statement 2, we know that if it's not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair (since there are no other possibilities).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
