The first statement only tells us that the milk might not be in the fridge, but it doesn't provide any information about its current location. The second statement provides two possibilities, but we don't have enough information to determine which one is true.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements alone, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
