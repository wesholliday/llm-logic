            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" (\u00ac(Sunglasses are perched on her head))\n\t* \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" ((Sunglasses are in her bag) \u2228 (Sunglasses are perched on her head))\n\n2. We can simplify the second statement by applying De Morgan's law to the negation of the first statement:\n\t* \u00ac(\u00ac(Sunglasses are perched on her head)) \u2192 (Sunglasses are in her bag)\n\t* This is equivalent to: (Sunglasses are in her bag) \u2228 (Sunglasses are perched on her head)\n\n3. Now we can combine the two statements using logical OR:\n\t* \u00ac(Sunglasses are perched on her head) \u2227 ((Sunglasses are in her bag) \u2228 (Sunglasses are perched on her head))\n\n4. By applying distributivity of AND over OR, we get:\n\t* \u00ac(Sunglasses are perched on her head) \u2227 (Sunglasses are in her bag)\n\t* This is equivalent to: (\u00ac(Sunglasses are perched on her head)) \u2192 (Sunglasses are in her bag)\n\n5. Finally, we can conclude that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag:\n\t* Answer: yes",
