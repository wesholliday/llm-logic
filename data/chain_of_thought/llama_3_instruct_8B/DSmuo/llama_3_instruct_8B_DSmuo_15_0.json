This implies that it's possible for them not to be lined up by the door.\n\nNow, let's consider the disjunction in (2). If the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet (since one of the two options has to be true).\n\nSo, we can conclude that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they are indeed in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
