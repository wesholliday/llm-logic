From (2), we know that either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nSince we've already established that the keys don't have to be dangling in the cabinet, it means that the second option (\"they must be dangling in the cabinet\") is not true.\n\nThis leaves us with only one option: \"the keys are in the drawer\". Therefore, we can infer that the keys are indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
