This means there might be other options for where the puzzle piece could be.\n\nStatement 2 presents a disjunction between two possibilities: being in the box or blending in on the floor. Since we've already established that it's not necessarily true that the puzzle piece must blend in on the floor, this leaves us with only one option: the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
