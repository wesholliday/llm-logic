Since we know that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen (statement 1), we can conclude that option B is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the phone is not in the living room (\u00acA), then it must be ringing in the kitchen (B). But we know this is not the case (statement 1).\n* Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is indeed in the living room (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
