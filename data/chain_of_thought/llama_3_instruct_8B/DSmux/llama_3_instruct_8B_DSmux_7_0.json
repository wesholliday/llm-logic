The statement \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked\" is a negation of the second option in the original disjunction.\n3. From step 2, we can conclude that the first option \"The whiffle is shanked\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle is indeed shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
