The statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" implies that there are only two possibilities for the state of the sprocket: either it is cranked or it must be daggled.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" implies that the second possibility (the sprocket must be daggled) is ruled out.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* The first possibility (the sprocket is cranked) is left as a remaining option.\n* Since it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, and there are only two possibilities, the conclusion follows that:\n\t+ The sprocket is indeed cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
