The statement \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" is a negation of the second option in the original disjunction.\n3. Since we know that it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled, we can conclude that the first option in the original disjunction must be true: \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\".",
