The statement \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" gives us two options:\n\t* Option 1: The twonk is varnished\n\t* Option 2: The twonk must be plinked\n2. We are given another statement: \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\".\n3. This means we can eliminate Option 2, since it's not true.\n4. Since we have eliminated one option, and there are only two options, this leaves us with only one possibility:\n\t* The twonk is varnished\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is indeed varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
