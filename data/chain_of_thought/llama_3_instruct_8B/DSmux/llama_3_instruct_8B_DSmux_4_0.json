The statement \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\" is a negation of the second option in the original disjunction.\n3. Since we know that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked, this means that the first option \"the fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
