We have two statements:\n\t* Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled (N)\n2. From statement N, we can infer that the zinger cannot be smoogled.\n3. Since the zinger cannot be smoogled, we can conclude that it must be fraggled (by E).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that The zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
