We have two statements:\n\t* Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the clug must be snugged (\u00acM)\n2. From statement E, we can infer that either one of the following is true:\n\t* The clug is fleeked (\u2200)\n\t* The clug must be snugged (M)\n3. Since \u00acM, we know that M is not true.\n4. Therefore, from step 2 and 3, we can conclude that only one option remains true: \u2200 (The clug is fleeked)\n\nAnswer: yes",
