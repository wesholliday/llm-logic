This implies that there are only two possibilities for the state of the sneg: either it is crampled or it must be sproted.\n3. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\".\n4. This means that the possibility that the sneg must be sproted is ruled out.\n\nNow, let's combine this information:\n\n* We know that either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted (from statement 1).\n* But we also know that it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted (from statement 2).\n\nThis means that the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is indeed crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
