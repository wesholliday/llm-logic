The statement \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" is a negation of the second option in the original disjunction.\n3. Since we know that \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\", this means that the first option \"The flug is blummed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
