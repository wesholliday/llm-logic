The statement \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\" is a negation of the second option in the original disjunction.\n3. Since the second option (\"it must be bimmed\") has been negated, we can conclude that it is not true.\n4. From step 1, we know that either \"the wug is flooped\" or \"it must be bimmed\" is true. Since we've already established that \"it must be bimmed\" is not true (step 3), the only remaining option is that \"the wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
