This statement can be rewritten as a disjunction (a statement that says something is either true or true): \"The smonk is vreebled \u2228 it must be plagged\"\n3. We are given another statement: \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\".\n4. This statement can be rewritten as its negation: \u00ac(it must be plagged)\n5. Using De Morgan's laws, we can rewrite the original statement (1) as: \u00ac(it must be plagged) \u2228 The smonk is vreebled\n6. Now we have a disjunction with two parts: one that says it's not the case that the smonk must be plagged, and another that says the smonk is vreebled.\n7. Since \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\" is true (given statement 2), we can conclude that the second part of the disjunction must also be true: The smonk is vreebled\n\nAnswer: yes",
