The statement \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" implies that there are only two possibilities for the state of the shank:\n\t* It is plooked\n\t* It must be nugged (i.e., it is not plooked)\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" implies that the second possibility in step 1 is false.\n3. Since the second possibility is false, we can conclude that the first possibility is true: the shank is indeed plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
