The statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" negates the possibility that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the first option \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true, since it's the only remaining possibility. If the grommet were not sploffed, then it would have to be plopped, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
