The statement \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" is a negation of the second option in the original disjunction.\n3. Since we know that \"it's not the case that the dreb must be spened\", this means that the first option \"the dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
