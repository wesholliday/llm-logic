We have two premises:\n\t* Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the wug must be garpled (~M)\n2. From premise E, we can derive a disjunction: either the wug is sproinged (S) or it must be garpled (M).\n3. We also know that ~M from premise ~M.\n4. Using the law of excluded middle, we can conclude that S (since M is false).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
