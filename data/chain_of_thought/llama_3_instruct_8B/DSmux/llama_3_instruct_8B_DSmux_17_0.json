We have two premises:\n\t* Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the flob must be movated (~M)\n2. From premise E, we can infer that either the flob is skizzled (\u2203S) or it's not the case that the flob must be movated (~M). This is because the premises are mutually exclusive (either-or situation).\n3. We know from premise ~M that it's not the case that the flob must be movated.\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that \u2203S (the flob is skizzled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
