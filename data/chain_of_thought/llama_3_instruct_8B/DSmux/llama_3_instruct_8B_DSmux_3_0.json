We have two premises:\n\t* Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked (E)\n\t* It's not the case that the splat must be quanked (\u00acM)\n2. From premise E, we can infer that either the splat is morphed (\u2203M) or it is not the case that the splat must be quanked (\u00acM). This is because the premises are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n3. We know from premise \u00acM that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked. This means that the second option in premise E, \u00acM, is true.\n4. Since \u00acM is true, we can conclude that the first option in premise E, \u2203M (the splat is morphed), must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nThe splat is morphed\n\nAnswer: yes",
