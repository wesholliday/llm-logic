    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. Only one new law will be passed this session.\n2. The order of likelihood for the three laws is: minimum wage hike > paid family leave > student loan forgiveness.\n3. If paid family leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n\nFrom statement 3, we can infer that there is a conditional relationship between the events:\n\n* If paid family leave doesn't happen, it implies that either a minimum wage hike or student loan forgiveness (or both) will happen.\n* Since a minimum wage hike is more likely to happen than paid family leave, it's probable that a minimum wage hike will occur instead of paid family leave.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that student loan forgiveness is much less likely to happen than a minimum wage hike. Therefore, even if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it's still more probable that paid family leave would occur instead of student loan forgiveness.\n\nHowever, since a minimum wage hike is likely to happen (statement 2), and paid family leave is unlikely to happen when a minimum wage hike occurs (from the previous reasoning), we can conclude that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it's more probable that loan forgiveness will happen.\n\nSo, yes.",
