    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

If the common cold doesn't infect the most people, it means that either the flu or strep throat must be infecting more people than the common cold.\n3. Since the flu is expected to infect the most people, if it doesn't, it implies that the common cold didn't infect the most people either (because the flu would have infected the most).\n4. Therefore, if the flu doesn't infect the most people, it means that strep throat must be infecting more people than the common cold.\n\nSo, yes, it does follow that if the flu doesn't infect the most people, strep will likely infect the most.",
