Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

Mysteries are far behind thrillers and romances in terms of sales.\n\nFrom these points, we can conclude that if thrillers aren't #1, then romances will likely be #1 (since they're the closest competitor). However, this doesn't necessarily mean that mysteries will be #1 if thrillers aren't. There could be other genres or factors that affect the ranking.\n\nThe statement \"if thrillers aren\u2019t  #1, then if romances aren\u2019t, mysteries will be\" is a non-sequitur and doesn't logically follow from the given information. The correct conclusion would be: \"If thrillers aren\u2019t  #1, then romances are likely to be #1.\"",
