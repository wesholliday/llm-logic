    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

If pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, then burgers won't be either (because they are in second place).\n3. Therefore, if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be (since they are the only remaining option).\n\nThe conclusion \"it's likely that, if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
