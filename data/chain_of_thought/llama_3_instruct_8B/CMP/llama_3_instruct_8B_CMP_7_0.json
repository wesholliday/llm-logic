    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity this year.\n2. Solar power is likely to come second, with wind power lagging significantly behind.\n3. If solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will (since there are only three major sources).\n4. However, tidal power is also likely to generate the most electricity.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity. If this is not the case (i.e., tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity), then solar power must be generating the most electricity (since it's the only other option).\n\nBut wait! Statement 2 says that if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will. However, we've just established that solar power is indeed generating the most electricity in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will. In fact, the opposite is true: if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, solar power will.\n\nAnswer: no",
