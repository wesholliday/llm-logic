    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n2. If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then tea won't retain the most morning drinkers (since tea comes second in popularity).\n3. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers (since it's the only other option left).\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\"\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a conditional relationship between coffee and soda. However, there's an implicit assumption that hasn't been explicitly stated: that tea won't retain the most morning drinkers if coffee doesn't.\n\nTo strengthen the conclusion, we need to add this additional step:\n\n4. If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then tea won't retain the most morning drinkers (from step 2).\n5. Therefore, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers (from steps 3 and 4).\n\nAnswer: yes",
