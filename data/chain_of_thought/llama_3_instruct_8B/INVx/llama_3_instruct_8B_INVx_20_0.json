Contraposition states that if P \u2192 Q, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn our case, P = \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q = \"it surned\". So, the original statement can be rewritten as:\n\n\"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is equivalent to \"\u00ac(it surned) \u2192 \u00ac(the fleeg was bluttered)\"\n\nNow, we can apply contraposition to get:\n\n\u00ac(it did not surn) \u2192 \u00ac(the fleeg was not bluttered)\n\nThis is equivalent to the statement we want to infer:\n\n\"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\"\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the original statement from the given one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
