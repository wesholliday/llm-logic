This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n\t* P \u2192 Q (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended)\n3. Where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spended\".\n4. Now, we want to infer another statement: \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spended.\"\n5. This can be rewritten as:\n\t* \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spended)\n6. To see if we can infer this statement from the original one, let's try to derive it using the given statement.\n\nUsing modus tollens (a rule of inference), we can derive:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nFrom P \u2192 Q and \u00acP (assuming \u00acP is true)\n\nThis means that if the dreb was not vroombed (\u00acP), then it cannot be spended (\u00acQ).\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spended.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
