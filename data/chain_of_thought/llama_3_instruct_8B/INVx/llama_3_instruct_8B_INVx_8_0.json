This statement implies that there is a relationship between being cranked and being daggled.\n3. Specifically, it suggests that if the sprocket is cranked, it must also be daggled (i.e., the condition of being cranked implies the condition of being daggled).\n4. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\".\n5. This statement is saying that if the sprocket is not cranked, it cannot be daggled (i.e., the condition of not being cranked implies the negation of being daggled).\n6. Since the original statement only implies a relationship between being cranked and being daggled, we can't directly infer the converse statement.\n7. However, we can use logical reasoning to establish the converse statement.\n\nThe key insight is that if being cranked implies being daggled, then not being cranked cannot imply being daggled (since being cranked is a necessary condition for being daggled).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
