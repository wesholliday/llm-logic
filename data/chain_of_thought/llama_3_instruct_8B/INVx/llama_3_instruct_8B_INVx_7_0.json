This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n\t* P (whiffle was shanked) \u2192 Q (whiffle tinked)\n3. Using the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite this statement as:\n\t* \u00acQ (whiffle did not tink) \u2192 \u00acP (whiffle was not shanked)\n4. This rewritten statement is equivalent to \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that if the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
