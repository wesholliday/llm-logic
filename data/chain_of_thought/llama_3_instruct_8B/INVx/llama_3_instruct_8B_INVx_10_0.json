In this case, the condition is \"the wug was sproinged\" and the conclusion is \"it was garpled\".\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\", we need to apply the same logical structure. We can do this by negating both the condition and the conclusion:\n\n* Negate the condition: \"the wug was NOT sproinged\"\n* Negate the conclusion: \"it WAS NOT garpled\"\n\nThe resulting statement would be:\n\n\"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original one. If we can conclude that \"if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\", we can also conclude that \"if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
