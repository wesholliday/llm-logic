However, this does not imply anything about the opposite scenario: what happens when the clug is NOT \"fleeked\"?\n\nWe cannot infer from this statement whether or not the clug will be \"snugged\" if it's not \"fleeked\". The original statement only provides information about the relationship between being \"fleeked\" and being \"snugged\", but does not provide any information about the opposite scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that:\n\n\"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\"\n\nAnswer: no",
