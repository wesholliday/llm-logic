If we negate both the antecedent (\"slogged\") and the consequent (\"tragged\"), we get:\n\n\"If the glip was NOT slogged, THEN the glip WAS NOT tragged\"\n\nThis new statement is logically equivalent to the original one, since it preserves the same relationship between \"slogged\" and \"tragged\". Therefore, we can indeed infer that if the glip was not slogged, then it was not tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
