Contraposition states that if P implies Q, then \u00acQ implies \u00acP.\n\nIn our case, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" can be rewritten as:\n\n\u00ac(the grommet was not sploffed) \u2192 \u00ac(the grommet did not plop the frink)\n\nUsing contraposition, we get:\n\n\u00ac\u00ac(the grommet was not sploffed) \u2192 \u00ac\u00ac(the grommet did not plop the frink)\n\nSimplifying the negations, we get:\n\n(the grommet was not sploffed) \u2192 (the grommet did not plop the frink)\n\nThis is equivalent to the original statement we wanted to infer: \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
