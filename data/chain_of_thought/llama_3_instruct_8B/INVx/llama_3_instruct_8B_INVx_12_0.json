If we negate both parts of the original statement, we get:\n\n\"If the smip was NOT shripped (NOT the condition), THEN the smip DID NOT lup the zoint (NOT the consequence)\"\n\nThis is a valid inference, as it maintains the same logical structure and negates both parts of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
