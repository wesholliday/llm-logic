Contraposition states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\", we can infer the converse conditional statement \"If not-B, then not-A\".\n\nIn our case, the original statement is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\". Applying contraposition, we get:\n\n\"If not-the flob was movated, then not-the flob was skizzled\"\n\nNow, to get the desired statement, we need to negate both sides of the conditional. Negating the consequent \"not-the flob was movated\" gives us \"the flob was movated\". Negating the antecedent \"not-the flob was skizzled\" gives us \"the flob was skizzled\".\n\nHowever, this is not what we want. We need to negate both sides again to get:\n\n\"If the flob was not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\"\n\nThis is equivalent to our desired statement:\n\n\"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
