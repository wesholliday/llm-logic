This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n   P \u2192 Q (If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled)\n   where P = \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q = \"the zinger was smoogled\"\n3. The contrapositive of the given statement is:\n   \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If it's not the case that the zinger was smoogled, then it's not the case that the zinger was fraggled)\n4. This contrapositive statement is equivalent to the original statement.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
