This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n   P \u2192 Q (If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged)\n   where P = \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q = \"the smonk plagged\"\n3. Now, we want to infer another statement: \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\".\n4. This can be rewritten as:\n   \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged)\n   where \u00acP = \"the smonk was not vreebled\" and \u00acQ = \"the smonk was not plagged\"\n5. To infer this statement from the original one, we need to apply modus tollens (a rule of inference):\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n6. In our case, we have:\n   P \u2192 Q (given)\n   \u00acQ (we want to prove this implies \u00acP)\n\nNow, let's see if the given statement can be used to infer the desired conclusion:\n\n7. From step 1, we know that P \u2192 Q.\n8. We also want to show that \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. To do this, we'll use modus tollens:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n9. Since we have P \u2192 Q (step 1), we can substitute it into the above formula:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP becomes: If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00ac(P)\n10. Now, we can apply modus tollens to get our desired conclusion:\n    \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
