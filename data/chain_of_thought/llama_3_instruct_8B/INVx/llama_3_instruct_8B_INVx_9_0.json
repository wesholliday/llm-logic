If the condition is negated (the twonk being NOT plinked), then the original statement doesn't guarantee that the consequence will be true.\n\nHowever, if the twonk was not plinked, it's possible that it could still be varnished for some other reason. The original statement only guarantees that if the twonk is plinked, it will be varnished, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of the twonk being varnished without being plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished\". There might be other reasons why the twonk is varnished, and the original statement doesn't provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
