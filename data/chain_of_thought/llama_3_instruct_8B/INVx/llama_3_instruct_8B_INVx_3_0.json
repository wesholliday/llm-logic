This statement implies that there is a relationship between being morphed and quanking.\n3. If we assume that the relationship is one of causality (i.e., being morphed causes quanking), then we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, it did not quank.\n\nThis is because if being morphed is the cause of quanking, and the splat was not morphed, then there would be no reason for it to quank. Therefore, we can conclude that \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
