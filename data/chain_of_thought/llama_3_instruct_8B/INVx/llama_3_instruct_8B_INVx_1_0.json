The statement implies that if the flugel is blimmed, it must also be zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement:\n\n\"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\"\n\nThis statement is trying to infer that if the flugel is not blimmed, it cannot be zargled. However, we can't directly conclude this from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us what happens when the flugel is blimmed (it gets zargled), but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed. It's possible that there are other conditions or circumstances under which the flugel can be zargled, even if it's not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement from the original one. The answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
