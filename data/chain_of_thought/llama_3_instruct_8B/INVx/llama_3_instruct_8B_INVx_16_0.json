Contraposition states that if we swap the antecedent and consequent in a conditional statement, while also negating both, we get a logically equivalent statement.\n\nSo, let's apply this:\n\nOriginal statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\"\nContrapositive statement: \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\"\n\nNow, we can see that the contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original one. This means that if the sneg did not sprot the frink, it must be because the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
