This implies that being plooked is a sufficient condition for being nugged (i.e., if something is plooked, it must also be nugged).\n3. Now, we want to infer the converse: \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\".\n4. To do this, we need to show that being not-plooked is a necessary condition for being not-nugged (i.e., if something is not plooked, it cannot be nugged).\n\nFrom the original statement, we know that being plooked implies being nugged. However, we don't have any information about what happens when something is not plooked. It's possible that there are other conditions under which a shank can be nugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\". There might be exceptions where a shank is nugged even though it wasn't plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
