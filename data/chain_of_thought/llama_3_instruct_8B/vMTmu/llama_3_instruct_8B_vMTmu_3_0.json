            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\"\nThis premise states that there is a conditional relationship between two statements: the book being written by James and the book being a mystery novel.\n\n2. Premise 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\"\nThis premise negates the conclusion of the first premise, stating that it's not true that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The book was not written by James\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see how the premises lead to the conclusion. If the premises are true and the conclusion follows necessarily from them, then the argument is valid.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. From Premise 2, we know that this is not the case (the book does not have to be a mystery novel). Therefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James, since if it were, it would have to be a mystery novel, which is not true.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is valid because the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
