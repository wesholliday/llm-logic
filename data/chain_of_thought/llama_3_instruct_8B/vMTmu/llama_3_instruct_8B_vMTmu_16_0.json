            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: \"If P (shirt is cotton), then Q (pants are denim)\".\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\", which can be rewritten as \u00acQ (not-pants-are-denim).\n3. The conclusion states \"The shirt was not cotton\", which is equivalent to \u00acP (not-shirt-is-cotton).\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (shirt is cotton), then Q (pants are denim). From premise 2, we know that \u00acQ (not-pants-are-denim). We can combine these two statements using modus tollens:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\u00acQ\n\nUsing the first premise again, we can substitute Q with \"pants must have been denim\" to get:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00ac(pants must have been denim)\n\u00ac(pants must have been denim)\n\nNow, we can use the second premise to conclude that:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00ac(it's not the case that pants must have been denim)\n\u00ac(it's not the case that pants must have been denim)\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that it is not the case that the shirt is cotton. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
