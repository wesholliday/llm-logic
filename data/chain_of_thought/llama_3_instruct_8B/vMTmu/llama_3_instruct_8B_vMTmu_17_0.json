            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (where P = \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q = \"Kate must have eaten salad\").\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\", which can be represented as \u00acQ.\n3. The conclusion is \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom the first premise (P \u2192 Q), we know that if Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate must have eaten salad (Q). From the second premise (\u00acQ), we know that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that Q is false.\n\nNow, let's combine these two pieces of information: P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ. Using the law of modus tollens (\u223cP \u2228 Q \u2192 \u223cQ), we can conclude that \u223cP (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the premises entail the conclusion:\n\nAnswer: yes",
