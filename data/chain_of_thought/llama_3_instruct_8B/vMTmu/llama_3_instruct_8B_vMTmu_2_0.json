            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: \u00ac(griffin in forest) \u2228 (unicorn in forest).\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\", which can be rewritten as \u00ac(unicorn must have been in forest). This is equivalent to \u00ac((unicorn in forest)).\n3. The conclusion is \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows from the premises alone that the conclusion must be true.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. From premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This implies that \u00ac(unicorn in forest).\n\nNow, let's assume for the sake of contradiction that the griffin is indeed in the forest (griffin in forest). Then, from premise 1, we would also expect the unicorn to be in the forest (unicorn in forest), which contradicts premise 2.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the griffin is in the forest leads to a logical contradiction. This means that it's impossible for the griffin to be in the forest, and hence the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
