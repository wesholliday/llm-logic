            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: \"If P (cake is chocolate), then Q (muffins are blueberry)\".\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\". This can be rewritten as \u00acQ (not-muffins-are-blueberry).\n3. The conclusion is \"The cake was not chocolate\", which we'll represent as \u00acP (not-cake-is-chocolate).\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (cake is chocolate), then Q (muffins are blueberry). From premise 2, we know that \u00acQ (not-muffins-are-blueberry).\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer \u00acP (not-cake-is-chocolate) from the premises:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 Q (from premise 1)\n\u00acQ (from premise 2)\n\u2234 \u00acP (by modus tollens)\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the premises entail the conclusion. If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins would have been blueberry (Q). But since it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (\u00acQ), we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
