            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy must have gone to the zoo).\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This is a negation of the conclusion Q.\n3. The conclusion is \"Joe did not go to the park\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Joe went to the park (P), then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (Q). From the second premise, we know that Q is not true. Therefore, P cannot be true either, since if P were true, Q would also be true.\n\nThis means that the conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" follows logically from the premises. The argument is valid because it uses a correct application of modus tollens (if P \u2192 Q, then \u00acQ \u22a2 \u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
