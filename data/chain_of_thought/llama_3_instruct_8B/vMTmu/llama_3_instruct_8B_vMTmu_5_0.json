            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: If P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy must have played tennis).\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\", which can be rewritten as \u00acQ (not-Amy must have played tennis).\n3. The conclusion is \"Jeff did not play basketball\", which we'll represent as \u00acP (not-Jeff played basketball).\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy must have played tennis). From premise 2, we know that \u00acQ (not-Amy must have played tennis). This means that Q cannot be true, since it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy must have played tennis) is false, because Q is already known to be false. Therefore, we can conclude that \u00acP (not-Jeff played basketball).\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the premises entail the conclusion. The first premise sets up a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, while the second premise provides evidence against Amy playing tennis. From these two premises, we can logically deduce that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
