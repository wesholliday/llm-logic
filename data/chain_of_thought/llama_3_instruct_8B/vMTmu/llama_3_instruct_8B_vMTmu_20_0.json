            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"The apple being red implies the banana being yellow\".\n2. Premise 2: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\"\nThis is a negation of the conclusion drawn from premise 1.\n3. Conclusion: \"The apple was not red\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises logically entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not true that the banana must have been yellow. This means that the banana might not have been yellow (or any other color).\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\". If the apple is indeed red, this premise would imply that the banana is yellow.\n\nHowever, we know from premise 2 that it's not true that the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple is red, the banana might not be yellow (or any other color).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the apple being red does not necessarily mean the banana was yellow. The premises do not logically entail the conclusion \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: no",
