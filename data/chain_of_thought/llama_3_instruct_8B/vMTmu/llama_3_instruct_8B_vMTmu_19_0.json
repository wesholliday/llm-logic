            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball).\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\". This can be rewritten as \u00acQ (not-Q), where Q represents the proposition \"Jen must have watched basketball\".\n3. The conclusion is \"Tom did not watch football\", which we'll represent as \u00acP (not-P).\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that P \u2192 Q.\nFrom premise 2, we know that \u00acQ.\nWe can use modus tollens (a rule of inference) to conclude that \u00acP:\n\n\u00acQ \u22a2 \u00ac(P \u2192 Q)\n\u00acQ \u22a2 P \u2227 \u00acQ\n\u00acQ \u22a2 P (since P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ imply P)\n\nNow, combining this with the original conclusion \u00acP, we can see that the premises do indeed entail the conclusion:\n\n\u00acQ \u22a2 P\n\u00acQ \u22a2 \u00acP\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
