            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (Alex finishing the race implies Chris finishing the race).\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\", which can be represented as \u00acQ (Chris not necessarily finishing the race).\n3. The conclusion is \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows a valid logical form. Let's apply modus tollens (MT), which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Alex finished the race\n* Q: Chris must have finished the race\n\nWe can substitute these into the MT formula:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\nIf Alex finished the race (P) implies Chris must have finished the race (Q), and it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (\u00acQ), then Alex did not finish the race (\u00acP)\n\nThis matches our original argument. Since we have a valid application of modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
