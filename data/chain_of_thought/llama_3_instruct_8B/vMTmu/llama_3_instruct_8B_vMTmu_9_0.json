            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\").\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\", which can be represented as \u00acQ.\n3. The conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom the first premise (P \u2192 Q), we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true. But from the second premise (\u00acQ), we know that Q is actually false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer \u00acP from P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP), then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt (\u00acQ).\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because of the second premise. The conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is not logically entailed by the premises.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
