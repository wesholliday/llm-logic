It's not the case that the truck must have been blue (Premise)\n3. Therefore, the car was not red (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue. This establishes a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This implies that the truck might not be blue after all.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: \"The car was not red.\" If the truck is indeed not blue (as stated in premise 2), then there's no logical connection between the car's color and the truck's color. We can't conclude anything about the car's color based on the truck's color.\n\nIn other words, the argument relies on an unstated assumption that if the truck isn't blue, then the car must be something else (not red). However, this assumption is not explicitly stated in the premises.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
