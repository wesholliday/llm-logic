            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy must have been awake\").\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\", which can be rewritten as \u00acQ.\n3. The conclusion is \"The vampire was not awake\", which is equivalent to \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises entail the conclusion. We can do this by using the conditional statement:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\nUsing modus tollens (a rule of inference), we can conclude that:\n\n\u00acP\n\nThis means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, but it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. Therefore, the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, so this argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
