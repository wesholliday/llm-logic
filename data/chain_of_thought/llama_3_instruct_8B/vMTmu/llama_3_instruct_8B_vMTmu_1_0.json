            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then it is necessary that Sue was at the wedding.\n2. The second premise states \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\". This means that it is not necessary for Sue to have been at the wedding.\n3. The conclusion is \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nNow, let's see if the argument is logically valid:\n\n* If Mary was at the wedding (assumed for the sake of contradiction), then it would be necessary for Sue to be at the wedding (by the first premise).\n* However, we know that it is not necessary for Sue to be at the wedding (by the second premise).\n* This creates a logical contradiction: if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there, but we know that's not the case.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a correct pattern of reasoning. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the premises are consistent with each other.",
