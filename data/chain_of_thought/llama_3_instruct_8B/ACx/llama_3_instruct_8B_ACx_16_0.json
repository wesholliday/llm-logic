We can infer from statement 1 that if the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink. Since we already know that the sneg did sproted the frink, this implies that the antecedent of the conditional sentence must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sneg was indeed crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
