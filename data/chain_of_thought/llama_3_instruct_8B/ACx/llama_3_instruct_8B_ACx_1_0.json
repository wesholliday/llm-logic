From statement 2, we know that the flugel is indeed zargled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nThe only way to conclude that the flugel was blimmed would be if we had additional information or a stronger connection between being blimmed and being zargled. Since we don't have any such information, we cannot infer with certainty whether the flugel was blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
