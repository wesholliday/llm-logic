We have two statements:\n\t* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\t* \"The grommet plopped the frink\"\n2. The second statement is a fact: we know that the grommet did indeed plop the frink.\n3. From this fact, we can infer that the condition in the first statement must be true, i.e., the grommet was sploffed.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The grommet was sploffed\" is a logical consequence of the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
