It doesn't provide any information about whether the smonk was vreebled or not.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the smonk was vreebled:\n\nWe know that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged (according to statement 1). We also know that the smonk did plagge (statement 2).\n\nHowever, we can't conclude that the smonk was vreebled just because it plagged. There could be other reasons why the smonk plagged, unrelated to being vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether the smonk was vreebled or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
