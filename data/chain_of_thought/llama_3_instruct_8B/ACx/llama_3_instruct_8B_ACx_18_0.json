From statement (2), we know that the shank is indeed nugged.\n3. Now, let's look at statement (1). It says that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged. This implies a conditional relationship between being plooked and being nugged.\n4. Since we already know from statement (2) that the shank is nugged, we can conclude that the condition in statement (1) is met: the shank is indeed nugged.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the shank was plooked, because if it were not plooked, it would not be nugged (according to statement (1)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
