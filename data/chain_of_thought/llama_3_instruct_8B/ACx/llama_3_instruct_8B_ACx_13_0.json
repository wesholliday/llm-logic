Since we also have a conditional statement (1), we can apply it to this new information. The condition in the conditional statement is \"the glip was slogged\", and the result is \"the glip was tragged\". Since we know that the result (\"The glip was tragged\") is true, we can conclude that the condition (\"The glip was slogged\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
