From the first statement, we can infer that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n3. Now, we have a new statement: \"The dreb was spened\".\n4. Since this statement matches the conclusion of the first statement (\"the dreb was spened\"), we can use modus ponens (a rule of inference) to conclude that:\n\t* If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\t* The dreb was spened.\n\t* Therefore, the dreb was vroombed.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"The dreb was vroombed\" from these two statements.",
