From statement 2, we know that the flug was indeed zimmed.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the flug was blummed. There could be other possibilities where the flug is zimmed without being blummed.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where there's another condition that makes the flug zimmed, but not blummed. In this case, statement 1 would still hold true (if the flug was blummed, then it would be zimmed), but statement 2 would not imply that the flug was blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the flug was blummed from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
