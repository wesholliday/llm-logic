We have two statements:\n\t* If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (conditional statement)\n\t* The zinger was smoogled (simple statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the zinger is fraggled, it must also be smoogled.\n3. Now, we have a new piece of information: the zinger is indeed smoogled (from the second statement).\n4. Since the zinger being smoogled implies that it was previously fraggled (based on the first statement), we can conclude that the zinger must have been fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
