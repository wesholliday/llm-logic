According to statement 1, if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint. Since we already know that the wug did bim the zoint, this means that the antecedent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug was flooped\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
