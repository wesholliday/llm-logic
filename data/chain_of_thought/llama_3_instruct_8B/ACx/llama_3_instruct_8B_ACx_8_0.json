We have two statements:\n\t* If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled (conditional statement)\n\t* The sprocket was daggled (simple statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, it must be true that the sprocket was daggled.\n3. Now, we have a new statement: \"The sprocket was daggled\".\n4. Since this statement is already known to be true (from the second statement), we can use it as evidence to support our inference from step 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
