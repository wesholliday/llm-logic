From the second statement, we know that \"the splat quanked\" is true.\n3. Since the first statement says \"if the splat was morphed\", and the second statement says \"the splat quanked\", we can conclude that if the splat quanked, then it must have been morphed (by modus ponens).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
