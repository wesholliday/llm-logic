This implies a conditional relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location.\n\nNow, let's examine statement (2): \"The cat was outside\". Since this is true, it means that the cat is actually outside, regardless of whether the dog is inside or not.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude from these statements alone that the dog is indeed inside. The conditional relationship in statement (1) only provides a necessary condition for the cat to be outside, but it does not guarantee that the dog is inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The dog was inside\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
