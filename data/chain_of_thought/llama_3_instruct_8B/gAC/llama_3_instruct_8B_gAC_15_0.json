If Sam takes a plane, it necessarily means that Erin takes a train.\n\n2. \"Erin took a train\" is true.\nThis statement tells us that Erin indeed took a train.\n\nNow, let's try to conclude whether \"Sam took a plane\" is true or not:\n\nSince we know that Erin took a train (from statement 2), and the conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train is that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train (from statement 1), it doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nIn other words, just because Erin took a train, we can't conclude that Sam took a plane. There could be other possibilities where Erin took a train without Sam taking a plane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
