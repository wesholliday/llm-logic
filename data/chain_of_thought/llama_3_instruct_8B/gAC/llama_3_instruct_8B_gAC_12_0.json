We can do this by using the implication from step 1:\n\n\"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\nLucy went to the zoo (given)\n\nSince the consequent of the implication (\"Lucy went to the zoo\") is true, we can conclude that the antecedent (\"Joe went to the park\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
