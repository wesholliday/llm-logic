This tells us that Sue indeed was at the wedding.\n\nSince Sue being at the wedding is a fact (from statement 2), we can conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because if Sue was at the wedding, then according to statement 1, Mary would also be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, it follows logically that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
