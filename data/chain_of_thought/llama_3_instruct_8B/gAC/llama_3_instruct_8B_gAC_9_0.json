This implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, from statement (2) alone, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt. The truth of \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not provide any direct information about whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but Mark still bought the blue shirt. In this scenario, both statements (1) and (2) would be true, but statement (3) \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" would be false.\n\nAnswer: no",
