And we also know that the truck is blue. However, this only tells us that the truck being blue is a possible consequence of the car being red, but it doesn't guarantee that the car is actually red.\n\nIn other words, there could be another possibility where the car is not red, but the truck happens to be blue for some other reason. Since we don't have any additional information to rule out this alternative scenario, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
