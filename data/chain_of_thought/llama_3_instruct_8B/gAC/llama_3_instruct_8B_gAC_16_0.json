It means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement \"The pants were denim\" is an independent statement that asserts the truth of the pants being denim.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether it follows that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the consequent (the pants being denim) is indeed true, we can conclude that the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
