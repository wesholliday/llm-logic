If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob will choose pasta.\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n\nThis statement tells us that Bob actually made the choice of pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Bob chose pasta (which is true), we can conclude that the condition in the first statement (\"Sue chose pizza\") must be false.
