This implies that if the vampire were awake, it would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the mummy is also awake. However, this does not mean that the converse is true; i.e., just because the mummy is awake, we cannot conclude that the vampire is awake.\n\nIn other words, the implication only goes one way: from \"vampire awake\" to \"mummy awake\", but not the reverse. Therefore, even though the mummy is awake (statement 2), we cannot logically conclude that the vampire is also awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
