It means that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement \"The truck was metal\" is an independent statement that asserts the truth of the truck being metal.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether it follows that \"The doll was plastic\" is true. Since the conditional statement in step 1 only guarantees the truth of the consequent (the truck being metal) if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, we cannot conclude that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nHowever, since we are given the additional information that \"The truck was metal\" is true, we can use modus ponens to infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement must also be true. This means that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
