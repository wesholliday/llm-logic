This implies a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that Amy did indeed play tennis.\n\nHowever, this information does not provide any direct evidence about whether Jeff played basketball or not. The statements only establish a connection between Jeff's basketball-playing and Amy's tennis-playing, but they do not reveal the actual state of affairs regarding Jeff's basketball-playing.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true. We can only say that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy would have played tennis, but this does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether Jeff actually played basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
