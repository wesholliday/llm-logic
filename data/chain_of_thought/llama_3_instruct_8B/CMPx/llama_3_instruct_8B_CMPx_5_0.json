The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil.\n2. The votal trails far behind the other two teams.\n3. If the darpil doesn't have the top record, then the votal will (since it's the only other option).\n4. The fraglen likely will lead the league (based on its expected performance).\n5. If the fraglen leads the league, then the darpil won't (since the fraglen is expected to have the best record).\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Is it likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will?\"\n\nFrom point 4, we know that the fraglen likely will lead the league. This means that there's a high probability that the fraglen will indeed lead the league.\n\nIf the fraglen doesn't lead the league (which is unlikely), then it must be the case that the darpil leads the league instead (since the votal trails far behind). But this contradicts point 5, which states that if the fraglen leads the league, the darpil won't. Therefore, it's not possible for the fraglen to not lead the league and for the votal to lead instead.\n\nSo, no, it doesn't follow that it's likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will. In fact, it's highly unlikely that this scenario would occur.",
