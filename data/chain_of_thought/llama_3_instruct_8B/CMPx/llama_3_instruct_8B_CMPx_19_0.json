    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

If the beelhet doesn't become domer, then if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer.\n\nFrom these two points, we can infer that:\n\n* The garplex has a higher chance of winning than the beelhet.\n* If the garplex doesn't win, the peedonk is likely to win (since it's the only other option).\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that it's likely for the peedonk to win if the garplex doesn't become domer. The likelihood of the peedonk winning depends on whether the beelhet wins or not.\n\nIf the beelhet wins, then the peedonk won't have a chance to win (since there are only three candidates). But if the beelhet doesn't win, then the peedonk has a higher chance of winning. Therefore, we can't say that it's likely for the peedonk to win if the garplex doesn't become domer.\n\nAnswer: no",
