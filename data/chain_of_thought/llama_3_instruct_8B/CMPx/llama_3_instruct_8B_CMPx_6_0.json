    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

Industry analysts expect the jentil to sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower.\n2. If the lomfry doesn't sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn't, the darsal will.\n\nFrom these two points, we can infer that:\n\n* The jentil is likely to lead gardam sales (point 1).\n* If the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will (point 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Does it follow that if the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will?\n\nThe answer is yes. This conclusion follows logically from the information provided. If the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, then according to point 2, the darsal will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
