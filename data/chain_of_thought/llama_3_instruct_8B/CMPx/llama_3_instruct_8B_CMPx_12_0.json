    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If the vanoon isn't selected, then if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected (since there are no other applicants).\n3. The stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won't be.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that:\n\n* The owner is likely to choose the stribben over the vanoon.\n* If the stribben isn't chosen, then the jentapp will be selected (since there are no other applicants).\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's likely for the jentapp to be selected if the stribben isn't selected. The owner might still choose the vanoon over the jentapp.\n\nTherefore, I would answer:\n\nAnswer: no",
