This possibility means that the fribble's being snurgled is not certain or guaranteed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can infer that it is possible for the fribble not to have been snurgled, which means that \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
