The sentence \"The twonk might not have been plinked\" is a statement about possibility, indicating that there is a chance the twonk was not plinked.\n2. From this statement, we can infer that the twonk's being plinked is not certain or guaranteed.\n3. Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\". This statement negates the idea that the twonk has to be plinked.\n4. Since we've already established that the twonk's being plinked is not certain or guaranteed (from step 2), it follows that it's indeed possible for the twonk not to have been plinked.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
