This implies that there is a chance (possibility) that the flugel was not blimmed, but it's not certain.\n3. Now, let's consider the negation \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\".\n4. The phrase \"must have\" implies necessity or certainty, which is opposite to the possibility mentioned in step 1.\n5. Therefore, if the flugel might not have been blimmed (step 1), it cannot be the case that it must have been blimmed (step 4).\n6. Hence, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
