The sentence \"The smip might not have been shripped\" is a statement about possibility, indicating that there is a chance the smip was not shripped.\n2. From this statement, we can infer that the smip's shripping status is uncertain or unknown.\n3. Now, let's consider the negation of the statement: \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\".\n4. This negation implies that there is no necessity for the smip to be shripped; it could possibly not be shripped.\n5. Since we already established that the smip's shripping status is uncertain or unknown, it follows that it's possible for the smip not to be shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
