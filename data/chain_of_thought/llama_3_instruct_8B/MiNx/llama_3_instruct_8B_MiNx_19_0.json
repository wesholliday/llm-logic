This possibility means that the smonk's being vreebled is not certain or guaranteed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can infer that it is possible (or even likely) that the smonk was not vreebled. This means that \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
