This possibility means that the grommet's being sploffed is not certain or guaranteed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the grommet must have been sploffed.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can infer that it's possible for the grommet to not be sploffed, which means \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
