The sentence \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" is a statement about possibility, indicating that the state of being vroombed is uncertain for the dreb.\n2. From this statement, we can infer that there is a possibility (albeit small) that the dreb has not been vroombed.\n3. The negation \"It's not the case that\" is used to indicate the opposite of what follows. In this case, it would mean that the opposite of \"the dreb must have been vroombed\" is true.\n4. Since we've established that there is a possibility the dreb has not been vroombed, it follows that it's possible for the dreb not to have been vroombed (i.e., the opposite of \"must have been vroombed\").\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
