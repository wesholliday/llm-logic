The sentence \"The flug might not have been blummed\" is a statement about possibility, indicating that the state of being blummed is uncertain for the flug.\n2. From this statement, we can infer that there is a possibility (albeit small) that the flug was not blummed.\n3. Now, let's consider the negation \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\". This statement asserts that it is impossible for the flug to be blummed.\n4. Since we've established that there is a possibility (albeit small) that the flug was not blummed, this implies that it's not necessarily the case that the flug must have been blummed.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
