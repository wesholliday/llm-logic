The sentence \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" is a statement about possibility, indicating that the state of being fleeked is uncertain for the clug.\n2. From this statement, we can infer that there is a possibility (albeit small) that the clug has not been fleeked.\n3. Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\". This statement is negating the idea that the clug necessarily or inevitably had to be fleeked.\n4. Given the possibility that the clug might not have been fleeked (from step 2), it follows that it cannot be the case that the clug must have been fleeked, since this would imply a necessity that is contradicted by the uncertainty in step 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
