This possibility means that the truth of whether the zinger was fraggled is uncertain or unknown.\n3. From this uncertainty, we cannot conclude with certainty that the zinger must have been fraggled.\n4. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
