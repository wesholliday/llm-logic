The original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" implies a causal relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired.\n2. The new statement \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" adds an additional condition (\"do hard labor\") to the original statement.\n\nTo infer the new statement from the original one, we would need to assume that doing hard labor has no effect on being tired, or that getting enough sleep completely eliminates the effects of hard labor. However, this is not necessarily true - it's possible that even with sufficient sleep, doing hard labor can still make someone tired.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one without additional information about the relationship between sleep, hard labor, and fatigue.\n\nAnswer: no",
