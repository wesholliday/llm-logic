It doesn't specify any other conditions that might affect our experience.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement:\n\n\"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\"\n\nThis statement adds an additional condition (\"a bomb goes off\") to the original scenario. However, the original statement didn't account for this possibility. In fact, it's highly unlikely that having a bomb go off at a concert would result in a good time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" from the original statement. The new condition (\"a bomb goes off\") is not accounted for in the original statement, and it's unlikely that having a good time would still be possible under such circumstances.\n\nAnswer: no",
