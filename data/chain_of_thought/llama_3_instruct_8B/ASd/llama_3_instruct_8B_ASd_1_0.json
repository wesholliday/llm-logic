However, it does not provide any information about other possible conditions that might affect the match's ability to light.\n\nThe additional condition \"it has been soaked in water\" introduces a new factor that could potentially prevent the match from lighting. Soaking the match in water could extinguish or damage the match, making it impossible for it to light even if it is struck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light\". The original statement only guarantees that striking the match will lead to lighting under normal conditions, but does not account for external factors like water exposure.\n\nAnswer: no",
