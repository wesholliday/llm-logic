The original statement \"If I take medication, I will feel better\" implies a causal relationship between taking medication and feeling better.\n2. The premise does not specify what kind of medication is being referred to. It could be any type of medication that is effective in improving one's condition.\n3. The conclusion \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" assumes that the expired medication is still effective in improving one's condition.\n4. However, expired medication may not be effective or safe to use. Its potency and efficacy may have decreased over time, making it less likely to produce the desired effect.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that we cannot infer \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" from the original statement. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a claim about the effectiveness of expired medication.\n\nAnswer: no",
