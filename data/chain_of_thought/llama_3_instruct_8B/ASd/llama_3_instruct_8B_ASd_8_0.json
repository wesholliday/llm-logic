If the package has shipped\n2. Then it will arrive today\n\nThe implication is that if the package has indeed shipped, it will necessarily arrive today.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement: \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\".\n\nThis statement adds an additional condition to the original statement: \"it was misrouted\". This means we are considering a scenario where the package has shipped, but something went wrong during transportation (misrouting).\n\nThe problem is that the original statement only guarantees arrival if the package has shipped. It doesn't account for any potential issues during transportation.\n\nIn this new scenario, even though the package has shipped, it's possible that it won't arrive today due to misrouting. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\".\n\nAnswer: no",
