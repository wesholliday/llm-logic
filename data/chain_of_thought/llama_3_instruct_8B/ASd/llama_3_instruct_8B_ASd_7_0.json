In other words, when the oven is on, it contributes to making the kitchen warm.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional condition \"the pilot light is out\". This condition seems unrelated to the original statement, as the pilot light is not directly mentioned in the initial statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer that if the pilot light is out, then the oven might not be functioning properly or efficiently. This could potentially reduce its ability to warm up the kitchen.\n\nGiven this new information, it's unclear whether the kitchen would still be warm if the pilot light is out. The original statement only guarantees warmth when the oven is on, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when other conditions are present (like a faulty pilot light).\n\nTherefore, we cannot confidently infer that \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\". There might be cases where the oven being on and the pilot light being out would not result in a warm kitchen.\n\nAnswer: no",
