It does not provide any information about whether they actually are or are not in her bag.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag?\"\n\nFrom the given statement, we can infer that there is a possibility that the sunglasses might not be in her bag. However, this does not necessarily mean that they cannot be in her bag. The statement only provides information about the possibility of them being or not being in her bag, but it does not provide any conclusive evidence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the sunglasses must not be in her bag. We can only say that there is a possibility that they might not be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
