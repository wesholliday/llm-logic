This does not necessarily mean that it must not be in the toy box.\n\nIn other words, just because there is a chance that the toy is not in the toy box, we cannot conclude with certainty that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box. There could still be some other possibility or scenario where the toy does indeed have to be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
