It's not making a definitive claim that it's definitely not in the drawer.\n\nTo infer that the notebook must not be in the drawer, we would need more information or a stronger statement. This statement only suggests that there's a chance it might not be in the drawer, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could still be there.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: yes",
