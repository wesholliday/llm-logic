This does not necessarily mean that it is definitely not in the bag, but rather that we cannot rule out the possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag?\"\n\nThe answer to this question is no because the statement only says that the pen might not be in the bag, which leaves open the possibility that it could still be in the bag. We cannot conclude with certainty that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
