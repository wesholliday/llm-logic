The question states \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\", which implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. This possibility means that we cannot conclude with certainty that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, because there is an alternative scenario where she didn't buy it.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
