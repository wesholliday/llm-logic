The statement \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" implies that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n2. If the watch is not charging on the dresser, it means that it cannot be charging on the dresser (since it's not possible for something to both be and not be in a certain state at the same time).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
