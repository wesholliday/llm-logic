This possibility means that it's not certain that the milk is on the counter.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the milk must be on the counter.\n4. Since we can't rule out the possibility that the milk is not on the counter, we can infer that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
