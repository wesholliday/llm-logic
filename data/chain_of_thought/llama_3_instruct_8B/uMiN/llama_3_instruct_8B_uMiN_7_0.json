To answer this, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If Alex didn't finish the race, then it's possible that they might not have finished.\n* But if Alex did finish the race, then it's certain that they must have finished.\n\nSince we don't know for sure whether Alex finished or not, we can't conclude with certainty that they must have finished. Therefore, we can infer that it's indeed possible that Alex didn't finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
