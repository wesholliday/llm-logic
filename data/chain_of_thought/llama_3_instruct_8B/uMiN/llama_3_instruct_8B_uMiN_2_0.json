This does not necessarily mean that it is impossible for the griffin to be in the forest.\n\nHowever, we can infer from this statement that:\n\n\"It is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n\nThis is because if the griffin might not have been in the forest, then it cannot be said with certainty that it must have been there. The possibility of it being elsewhere (or not existing at all) means that we cannot conclude that it must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
