This possibility means that the outcome of whether Jeff played basketball is uncertain, and we cannot be sure one way or the other.\n3. Since we cannot be sure, it's possible that Jeff actually did play basketball, but we just don't know for certain.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Jeff must have not played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
