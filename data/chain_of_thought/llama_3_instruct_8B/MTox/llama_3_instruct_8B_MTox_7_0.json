From the first statement, we know that the whiffle did not make a tinkling sound.\n3. The second statement says that if the whiffle was shanked, it would have made a tinkling sound (i.e., \"tinked\").\n4. Since the whiffle did not make a tinkling sound (from step 2), and if it were shanked, it would have made one (from step 3), we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
