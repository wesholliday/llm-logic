This implies that being sproinged is a sufficient condition for being garpled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" from these statements:\n\nIf the wug were sproinged, then it would be garpled (by statement 2). But we know that the wug is not garpled (by statement 1). Therefore, if the wug were sproinged, it would contradict the fact that it's not garpled.\n\nThis means that the wug cannot be sproinged. We can conclude that \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
