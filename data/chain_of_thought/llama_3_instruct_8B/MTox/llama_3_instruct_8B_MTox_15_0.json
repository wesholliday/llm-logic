From the first statement, we know that the dreb was not spened.\n3. The second statement says that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. This implies that being vroombed is a sufficient condition for being spened.\n4. Now, let's assume that the dreb was vroombed (for the sake of argument). Then, according to the second statement, the dreb would be spened. But we know from the first statement that this is not the case (the dreb was not spened).\n5. This creates a contradiction: if the dreb was vroombed, it would be spened, but we know it's not.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"The dreb was vroombed\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
