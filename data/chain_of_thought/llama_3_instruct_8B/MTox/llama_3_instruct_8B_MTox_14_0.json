The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. Since the clug did not snugged (according to the first statement), we can conclude that the antecedent \"the clug was fleeked\" cannot be true.\n4. If the antecedent cannot be true, then the consequent \"the clug snugged\" cannot also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
