The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the conclusion (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that contradicts the conclusion of the second statement: \"The zinger was not smoogled\".\n4. This means that the condition in the second statement cannot be true, because if it were, the conclusion would have to be true as well (since the conditional statement is true).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
