We have two statements:\n\t* \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement with two parts: the antecedent (\"the smip was shripped\") and the consequent (\"then the smip lupped the zoint\").\n3. We can infer that if the smip was shripped, it would have lupped the zoint (by virtue of Statement B).\n4. However, we also know that the smip did not lup the zoint (from Statement A).\n5. This creates a contradiction: if the smip was shripped, it would have lupped the zoint, but it didn't.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
