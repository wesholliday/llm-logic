The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinking) must also be true.\n3. However, we are given information that contradicts the consequence: \"The fribble did not crink\". This means that the fribble cannot have been snurgled, because if it were, it would have crinked, but it didn't.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
