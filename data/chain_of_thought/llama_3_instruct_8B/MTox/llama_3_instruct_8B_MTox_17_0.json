We have two statements:\n\t* \"The flob did not movated\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (\"the flob was skizzled\") is true, then the consequent (\"the flob movated\") must also be true.\n3. We are trying to infer whether \"The flob was not skizzled\" (Statement C) from Statement A and Statement B.\n\nTo do this, we can use a process called modus tollens:\n\n\t* If Statement C were true, then the flob would not have been skizzled.\n\t* But Statement A says that the flob did not movate. Since \"movated\" is equivalent to \"skizzled\", this means that the flob was indeed skizzled (by contraposition).\n\t* This contradicts our assumption that Statement C is true, so we can conclude that Statement C must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
