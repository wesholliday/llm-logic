The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the glip being slogged) is true, then the conclusion (the glip being tragged) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that the glip was not tragged (from the first statement).\n4. From this, we can conclude that the condition \"the glip was slogged\" cannot be true, because if it were true, then the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" would also have to be true, but we know that's not the case.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
