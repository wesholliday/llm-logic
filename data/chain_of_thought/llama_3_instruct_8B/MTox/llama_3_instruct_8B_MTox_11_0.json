The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. We are given that the flug was not zimmed, which means that the consequent of the second statement cannot be true.\n4. If the consequent cannot be true, it means that the antecedent (blummed) cannot be true either. This is because if the flug were blummed, then it would have been zimmed, but we know it wasn't.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
