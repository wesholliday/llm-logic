The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n3. We are given that the shank was not nugged, which means the antecedent of the second statement is false (since \"not nugged\" implies \"not plooked and not nugged\").\n4. Since the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude that the consequent (\"the shank was nugged\") is true or false.\n5. However, we can use the first statement to infer that the shank was not plooked (since it's not nugged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
