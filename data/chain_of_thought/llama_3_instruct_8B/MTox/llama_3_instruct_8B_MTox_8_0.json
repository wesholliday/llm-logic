The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the consequence (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that the sprocket was not daggled.\n4. From this information, we can conclude that the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" cannot be true, because if it were true, then the consequence \"the sprocket was daggled\" would also have to be true, which contradicts our given information.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
