We have two statements:\n\t* \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition is met (the sneg being crampled), then something else will happen (the sneg sproted the frink).\n3. We want to infer whether \"The sneg was not crampled\" from these two statements.\n4. If we assume the sneg was crampled, then Statement B would be true, and the sneg would have sproted the frink. But this contradicts Statement A, which says the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n5. Therefore, if the sneg was crampled, it would lead to a logical contradiction. This means that the assumption \"The sneg was crampled\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
