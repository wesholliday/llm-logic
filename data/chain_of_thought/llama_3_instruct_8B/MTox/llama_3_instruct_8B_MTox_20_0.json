If the fleeg was bluttered, it would surm.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that if the fleeg is bluttered, it would surm. However, statement 1 explicitly states that the fleeg did not surm together. This means that the condition in statement 2 (being bluttered) cannot be true, because if it were, the fleeg would surm, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
