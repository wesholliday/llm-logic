The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanking) must also be true.\n3. Since the first statement says \"The splat did not quank\", we know that the condition in the second statement (\"the splat was morphed\") cannot be true.\n4. If the condition were true, then the consequence would also be true, but since it's not true (the splat didn't quank), the condition must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
