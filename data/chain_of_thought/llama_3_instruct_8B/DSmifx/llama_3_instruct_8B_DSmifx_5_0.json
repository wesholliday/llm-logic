This means that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled (since one of these two possibilities has to be true).\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the zinger might not be smoogled. This implies that there's a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nCombining this information, we can conclude that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled (from statement 1). And since statement 2 tells us that the zinger might not be smoogled, this means that there's a possibility that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
