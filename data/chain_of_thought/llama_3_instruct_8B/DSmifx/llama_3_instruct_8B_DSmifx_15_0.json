However, we also know that the dreb might not be spent.\n* Since \"might not be spent\" implies that there are more than two possibilities for the state of the dreb (including not being spent), this contradicts the original statement \"Either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed\".\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: no",
