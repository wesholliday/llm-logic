However, we know from statement 2 that the flob might not be movated. This means that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated.\n\nSince the flob is either movated or skizzled (from statement 1), and it's possible that it's not movated (from statement 2), we can conclude that:\n\nThe flob is skizzled\n\nAnswer: yes",
