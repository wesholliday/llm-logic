We are given another statement that says \"the mummy was awake\".\n3. Since the second statement is not conditional, we can conclude that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's apply the first statement to our situation:\n\n\"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies that if the vampire is awake, it must be true that the mummy is also awake.\n4. We have already established that the mummy is awake (from step 2).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that if the mummy is awake, it must be true that the vampire is also awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
