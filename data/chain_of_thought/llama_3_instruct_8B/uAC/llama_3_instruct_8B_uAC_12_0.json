The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. We are given two separate statements:\n\t* \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\t* (No information about Joe's whereabouts)\n3. Since we know that Lucy did go to the zoo, we can conclude that the condition in the original statement is met: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\".\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Joe actually went to the park. The conditional statement only implies a relationship between Joe's actions and Lucy's actions; it doesn't provide direct evidence of Joe's whereabouts.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
