The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"Jen watched basketball\".\n3. Since Jen did watch basketball, we can conclude that the condition in the original statement is met (i.e., Jen did watch basketball).\n4.
