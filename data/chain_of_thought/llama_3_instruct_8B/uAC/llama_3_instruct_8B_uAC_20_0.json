The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n2. We are given additional information that the banana is indeed yellow.\n3. From this new information, we can conclude that the condition in the original statement is true: the banana is yellow.\n\nNow, let's apply this conclusion to the original statement:\n\n\"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\nSince the banana is indeed yellow, it means that the condition \"the apple was red\" must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
