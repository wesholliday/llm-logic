The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck.\n2. We are given another statement that says \"The truck was blue\".\n3. Since we know the truck is blue, we can conclude that if the car were indeed red, it would lead to the conclusion that the truck is blue (which we already know).\n4. However, this conditional relationship does not imply that the car must be red. It only implies that if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n5. We don't have any additional information about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
