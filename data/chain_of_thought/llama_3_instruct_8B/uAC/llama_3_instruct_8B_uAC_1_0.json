This conditional statement is followed by another statement \"Sue was at the wedding\", which can be considered as an independent fact.\n3. Since we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding (from the second statement), we can infer that the condition in the first statement must be true, i.e., Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
