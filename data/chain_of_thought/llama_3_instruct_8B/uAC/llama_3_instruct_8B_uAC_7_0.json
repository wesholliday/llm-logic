The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris.\n2. This means that if Alex finishes the race, it is guaranteed that Chris will also finish the race.\n3. However, this does not mean that if Chris finishes the race, Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nThe statement \"Chris finished the race\" only tells us that Chris completed the race, but it doesn't provide any information about Alex's completion of the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Alex finished the race just because Chris did. There might be other possibilities where Chris finished the race while Alex didn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
