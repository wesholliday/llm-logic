The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. We are given another statement that says \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n3. Since we know Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that the condition in the first statement is fulfilled (i.e., Mark bought the blue shirt).\n4.
