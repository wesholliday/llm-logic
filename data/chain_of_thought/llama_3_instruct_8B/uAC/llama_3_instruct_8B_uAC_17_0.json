This means that if Ben ate pasta, it is likely that Kate ate salad.\n2. We are given another statement \"Kate ate salad\". This statement does not provide any information about Ben's eating habits.\n3. Since we don't have any additional information about Ben's eating habits, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta based solely on the fact that Kate ate salad.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
