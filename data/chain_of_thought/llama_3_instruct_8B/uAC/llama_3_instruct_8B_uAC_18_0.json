The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck.\n2. We are given additional information that the truck is indeed metal (\"the truck was metal\").\n3. Since the truck being metal is consistent with the condition stated in the original sentence (i.e., if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal), we can conclude that the doll might be plastic.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the doll is plastic because there could be other possible combinations of materials for the doll and truck. For instance, the doll could be made of wood or fabric, and the truck could still be metal.\n\nTherefore, I would answer:\n\nAnswer: no",
