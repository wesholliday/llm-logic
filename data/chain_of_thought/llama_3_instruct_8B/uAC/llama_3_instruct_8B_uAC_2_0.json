The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" implies a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n2. We are given another statement that says \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n3. From this new information, we can conclude that the condition of the first statement is met (i.e., the unicorn is indeed in the forest).\n4. Since the condition is met, we can apply the conditional relationship to infer that the griffin must also be in the forest.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
