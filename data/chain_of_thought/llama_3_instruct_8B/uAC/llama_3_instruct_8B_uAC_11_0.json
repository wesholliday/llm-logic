The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies a conditional relationship between the cake and muffins.\n2. We are given another statement that says \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n3. Since we know the muffins are blueberry, we can conclude that the condition in the first statement is true (i.e., the cake is not chocolate).\n4. If the cake is not chocolate, then it must be something else.\n5. The only other option mentioned is that the cake was vanilla (not explicitly stated, but implied by the absence of chocolate).\n\nHowever, we cannot infer with certainty that the cake was chocolate because there might be other possibilities for the cake's flavor.\n\nAnswer: no",
