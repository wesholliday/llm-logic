We are given another statement \"Amy played tennis\", which is independent of the first statement.\n3. Since Amy played tennis, we can conclude that the condition in the original statement is met (i.e., Amy did play tennis).\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. The original statement only implies a correlation between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but it does not establish a direct causal link.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
