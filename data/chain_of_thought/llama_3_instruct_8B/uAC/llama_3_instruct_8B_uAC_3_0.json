The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the author and the genre of the book.\n2. We are given two separate statements:\n\t* \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\t* \"The book was written by James\"\n3. Since we know that the book is indeed a mystery novel (from statement 1), we can conclude that the condition in the original statement (\"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\") is met.\n4. Therefore, it is logical to infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
