The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside.\n2. We are given another statement that says \"the cat was outside\". This means that the condition in the first statement is fulfilled (i.e., the cat is indeed outside).\n3. Since the condition is fulfilled, we can infer that the converse of the original statement must also be true: if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
