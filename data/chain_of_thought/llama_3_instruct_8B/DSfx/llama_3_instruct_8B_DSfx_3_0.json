The splat is not quanked.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the splat is not quanked. This means that the first option in statement (1) - \"the splat is quanked\" - is false.\n\nSince the splat is not quanked, we can conclude that it must be morphed, as this is the only remaining option in statement (1).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
