Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked (This statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the state of the whiffle: it is either tinked or shanked.)\n\n2. The whiffle is not tinked (This statement is saying that the first possibility, \"the whiffle is tinked\", is false.)\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n* If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked (since there are only two possibilities and one of them has been ruled out).\n* Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is indeed shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
