Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped (This statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the state of the smip: either it is lupped or it is shripped.)\n2. The smip is not lupped (This statement is ruling out one of the possibilities mentioned in statement 1, which is that the smip is lupped.)\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n* From statement 1, we know that the smip is either lupped or shripped.\n* From statement 2, we know that the smip is not lupped.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that the smip must be shripped (since it cannot be lupped).\n\nAnswer: yes",
