The twonk is not plinked.\n\nFrom statement (1), we know that there are two possibilities:\n- The twonk is varnished\n- The twonk is plinked\n\nBut from statement (2), we know that the second possibility is false, i.e., the twonk is not plinked.\n\nNow, let's combine this information. Since the twonk is not plinked, and either it is varnished or plinked, then the only remaining option is:\n- The twonk is varnished\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is indeed varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
