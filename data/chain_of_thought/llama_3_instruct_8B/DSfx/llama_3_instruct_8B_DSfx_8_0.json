The sprocket is not daggled.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the sprocket is not daggled. This means that the first option in statement (1) is false, i.e., the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nSince there are only two options, and one of them has been ruled out, we can conclude that the second option must be true: the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
