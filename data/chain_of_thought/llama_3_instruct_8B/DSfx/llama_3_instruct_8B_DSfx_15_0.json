The dreb is not spened.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the dreb is not spended. This means that the first option in statement (1) - \"the dreb is spended\" - is false.\n\nSince the dreb is not spended, it must be vroombed according to statement (1). Therefore, we can infer that:\n\nThe dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
