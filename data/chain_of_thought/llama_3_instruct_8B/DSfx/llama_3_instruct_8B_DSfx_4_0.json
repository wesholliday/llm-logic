Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled (This statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the state of the fribble: either it's crinked or it's snurgled.)\n2. The fribble is not crinked (This statement is telling us that the first possibility, being crinked, is ruled out.)\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled, since there are only two possibilities and one of them has been eliminated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
