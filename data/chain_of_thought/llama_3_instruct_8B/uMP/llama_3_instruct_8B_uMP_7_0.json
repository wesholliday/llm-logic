The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris.\n2. This means that if Alex finishes the race, it is guaranteed that Chris will also finish the race.\n3. We are given another statement: \"Alex finished the race\".\n4. Since Alex has finished the race, we can apply the conditional relationship from step 1 to conclude that Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
