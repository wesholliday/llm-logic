The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies a conditional relationship between the cake and muffins.\n2. We are given another statement that says \"The cake was chocolate\".\n3. Since we know the cake is indeed chocolate, we can apply the conditional statement to this new information.\n\nFrom step 1, if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. And since we've established in step 2 that the cake is indeed chocolate, it follows logically that the muffins are also blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
