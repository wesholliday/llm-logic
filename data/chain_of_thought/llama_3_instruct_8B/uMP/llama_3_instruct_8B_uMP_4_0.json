The statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" implies a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n2. We are given two separate statements:\n\t* The alien visited Mars\n\t* The robot visited Jupiter (this is not explicitly stated, but we'll get to that later)\n3. Since the first statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" implies a conditional relationship, we can apply it to the situation.\n4. Given that the alien did visit Mars (as stated), we can conclude that the robot must have visited Jupiter according to the conditional statement.\n\nHowever, there's a catch! The original statement only implies a connection between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter, but it doesn't explicitly state that the robot visited Jupiter. We need more information to confirm this.\n\nLuckily, the second statement \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is not necessary for our inference. Since we've already applied the conditional relationship from step 1, we can conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
