This means that if Mary is indeed at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding.\n3. We are given another piece of information: \"Mary was at the wedding\".\n4. Since Mary is at the wedding, we can apply the conditional statement from step 1 to conclude that Sue must also be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
