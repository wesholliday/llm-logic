It means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n2. We are given additional information: \"The apple was red\". This makes the antecedent of the conditional statement true.\n3. Since the antecedent is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
