It means that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy will go to the zoo.\n2. We are given another statement: \"Joe went to the park\". This means that the condition in the first statement has been met (i.e., Joe did indeed go to the park).\n3. Since the condition has been met, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
