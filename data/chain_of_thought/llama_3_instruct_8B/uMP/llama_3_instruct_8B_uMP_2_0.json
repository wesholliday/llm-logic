It implies that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequence (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n2. We are given another piece of information: \"The griffin was in the forest\". This means that the condition in the original statement is indeed true.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
