The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that there is a conditional relationship between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's mode of transportation.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"Sam took a plane\".\n3. From this, we can conclude that the condition in the original statement is true, i.e., Sam did take a plane.\n4. Since the condition is true, we can apply the implication to infer that Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
