The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck.\n2. We are given additional information that the doll is indeed plastic (\"the doll was plastic\").\n3. Since the condition in the original statement is met (the doll being plastic), we can apply the consequence of the statement: \"then the truck was metal\".\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and the conditional relationship, we can infer that the truck is indeed metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
