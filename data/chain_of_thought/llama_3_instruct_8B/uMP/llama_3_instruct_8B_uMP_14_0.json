The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" implies a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n2. We are given additional information that \"the bear was in the cave\".\n3. Since the bear is indeed in the cave, we can apply the conditional statement to this situation.\n4. The conditional statement says that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den.\n5. Therefore, since the bear is in the cave, it logically follows that the wolf must be in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
