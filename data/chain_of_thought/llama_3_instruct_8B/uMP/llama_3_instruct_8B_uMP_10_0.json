The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies a conditional relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"the dog was inside\".\n3. Since the dog is indeed inside, we can conclude that the condition in the original statement is true (i.e., the dog is inside).\n4.
