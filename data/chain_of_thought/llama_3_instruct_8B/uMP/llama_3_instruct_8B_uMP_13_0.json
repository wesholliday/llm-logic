It means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. We are given additional information: \"The car was red\". This makes the antecedent of the conditional statement true.\n3. Since the antecedent is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequent must also be true. Therefore, if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n4. Combining this with the additional information, we can infer that the truck was indeed blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
