We can rewrite this as (\u00ac(The sneg is crampled)) \u2228 (The sneg must be sproted), using De Morgan's law.\n\nNow, we can apply modus tollens:\n\n\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted) \u2227 ((\u00ac(The sneg is crumped)) \u2228 (The sneg must be sproted))\n\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted) \u2227 \u00ac((The sneg is crumped) \u2227 \u00ac(The sneg must be sproted))\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can expand the right-hand side:\n\n\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted) \u2227 \u00ac(The sneg is crumped) \u2227 \u00ac\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted)\n\nSince \u00ac\u00acp is equivalent to p, we get:\n\n\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted) \u2227 \u00ac(The sneg is crumped) \u2227 (The sneg must be sproted)\n\nNow, we can apply the law of non-contradiction:\n\n\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted) \u2227 \u00ac(The sneg is crumped) \u2227 (The sneg must be sproted)\n\u00ac(The sneg must be sproted) \u2227 \u00ac(The sneg is crumped)\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\n\u00ac(The sneg is crumped)\n\nFinally, using the law of double negation, we get:\n\nThe sneg is crumped\n\nAnswer: yes",
