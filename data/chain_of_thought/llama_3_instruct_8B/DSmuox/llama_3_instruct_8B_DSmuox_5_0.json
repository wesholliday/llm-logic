It says that either the zinger is fraggled and it's not smoogled, or it must be smoogled. This implies that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 1 again. It says that it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This means that the zinger is not smoogled (\u00acZ \u2192 S).\n\nWe can combine this with statement 2. Since the zinger is not smoogled, we know that it must be fraggled ((\u00acZ) \u2192 F). This implies that the zinger is indeed fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
