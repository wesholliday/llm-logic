Since we know that \u00acQ, we can conclude that M is true.\n\nNow, let's combine this with statement 1: \u00acQ. We already established that M is true, so we can rewrite statement 2 as \u2203M \u2228 Q \u2192 M. This means that if the splat must be quanked or it's morphed (\u00acQ \u2228 M), then it's actually morphed (M).\n\nSince we know that \u00acQ, we can substitute this into the rewritten statement: \u00acQ \u2228 M \u2192 M. This is a logical implication, and since the antecedent (\u2227\u00acQ) is false, the consequent (M) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
