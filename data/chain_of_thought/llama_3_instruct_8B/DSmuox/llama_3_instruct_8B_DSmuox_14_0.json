This means that it's not necessary for the clug to be snugged. In other words, there might be a scenario where the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \u2203(Fleeked(Clug) \u2228 Must(Snugged(Clug))). This statement says that either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. We can rewrite this as:\n\n\u00ac(\u2200\u00acFleeked(Clug) \u2227 \u00acMust(Snugged(Clug)))\n\nThis means that if the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. From statement 1, we know that it's not necessary for the clug to be snugged. But from statement 2, we know that if the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged. This creates a contradiction: if the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged, but we also know that it's not necessary for the clug to be snugged.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can conclude that the clug must be fleeked. If it were not fleeked, then it would have to be snugged, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
