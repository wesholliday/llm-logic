This means that the possibility of spending the dreb is ruled out.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spended\". This statement says that there are two possibilities: either the dreb is vroombed (Vroombed(Dreb)) or it must be spended (Must(Spend(Dreb))). Since we know from statement 1 that the second option (Must(Spend(Dreb))) is not possible, we can focus on the first option.\n\nThe first option is \"the dreb is vroombed\" (Vroombed(Dreb)). This means that the dreb is indeed vroombed. We cannot conclude that it's not vroombed because there might be other possibilities that are not mentioned in these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
