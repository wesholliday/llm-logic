This means that there are two possibilities:\n\na) The flug is blummed (blummed)\nb) It must be zimmed (zimmed)\n\nSince we know that \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" (\u00aczimmed), we can conclude that option b) cannot be true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is:\n\na) The flug is blummed (blummed)\n\nThis means that we can infer that the flug is indeed blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
