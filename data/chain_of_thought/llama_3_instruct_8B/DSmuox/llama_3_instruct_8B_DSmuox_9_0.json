This means that either the twonk is varnished (V) and not plinked, or it must be plinked (P). Since we know from statement 1 that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked (\u00acP), we can conclude that PV.\n\nNow, let's combine this with statement 2: PV \u2228 P. We already established that PV, so we can substitute this into the original statement:\n\nPV \u2228 P \u2192 PV\n\nThis simplifies to just PV, which means the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
