Since we know that it's not the case that the flob must be movated (\u00acM), we can conclude that:\n\n\u2203S\n\nThis means that there exists a possibility where the flob is indeed skizzled.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 1 again: \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" (\u00acM). We've already concluded that \u2203S, which implies that M is false. Therefore:\n\n\u00acM \u2192 \u00ac\u2203M\n\nSince we know that \u00acM and \u00ac\u2203M are true, we can conclude that:\n\n\u00ac(\u00acM \u2227 \u00ac\u2203M)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\u00ac(\u00acM) \u2192 \u00ac(\u00ac\u2203M)\n\nUsing the law of double negation, we get:\n\nM \u2192 \u2203S\n\nNow, we have a conditional statement: if it's not the case that the flob must be movated (\u00acM), then the flob is skizzled (\u2203S). This implies that:\n\n\u00acM \u2192 \u2203S\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\n\u2203S\n\nAnswer: yes",
