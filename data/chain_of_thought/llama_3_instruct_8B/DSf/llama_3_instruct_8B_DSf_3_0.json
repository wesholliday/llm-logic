The statement \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" gives us two possibilities for the location of the keys.\n2. The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" tells us that one of those possibilities is not true, specifically that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n* We know that either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer (possibility 1) OR (possibility 2).\n* But we also know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet (which means possibility 1 is false).\n\nThis leaves us with only one possibility: the keys must be in the drawer (possibility 2). Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
