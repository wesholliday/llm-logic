The statement \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" tells us that one of these options is not true.\n3. Since we know the first option (\"the sunglasses are perched on her head\") is false, it means the second option (\"the sunglasses are in her bag\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
