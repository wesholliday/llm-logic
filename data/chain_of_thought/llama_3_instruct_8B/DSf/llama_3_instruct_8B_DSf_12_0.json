The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This means that the first option in statement (1) is false, i.e., the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nSince there are only two options, and one of them has been ruled out, it must be the case that the second option is true: the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
