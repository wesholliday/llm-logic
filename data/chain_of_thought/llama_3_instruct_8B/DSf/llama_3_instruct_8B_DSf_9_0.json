We have two statements:\n\t* Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\t* The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the first statement is true only if one of its two parts is true. Since the second statement says the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, we know that the first part of the first statement (\"the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor\") is false.\n\n2. Therefore, the only remaining option for the truth of the first statement is that the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box.\n\n3. Since we have eliminated the possibility that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box (i.e., it's not blending in on the floor), we can conclude with certainty that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
