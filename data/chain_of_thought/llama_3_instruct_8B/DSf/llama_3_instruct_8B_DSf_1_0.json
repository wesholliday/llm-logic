We have two statements:\n\t* Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside (this is an inclusive \"or\", meaning one of the options must be true)\n\t* Fido is not in the garden\n2. From statement 2, we know that Fido is not in the garden.\n3. Since Fido is not in the garden, it means that the first option (\"Fido is in the garden\") cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, the second option (\"Fido is inside\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
