It says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, and it implies that there might be other possibilities where Sue is at the wedding but Mary is not.\n\nHowever, since we know from statement 2 that Sue was indeed at the wedding, we can conclude that one of the possible scenarios mentioned in the implication (Mary being at the wedding) must also be true. In other words, if Sue was at the wedding, then it's likely that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does necessarily follow that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
