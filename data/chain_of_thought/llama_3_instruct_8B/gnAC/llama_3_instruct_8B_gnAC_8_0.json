It says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This implies a causal relationship between the two statements: if the vampire is awake, it necessarily leads to the mummy being awake.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the converse is true: just because the mummy is awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire is awake. The implication statement only provides a conditional relationship in one direction (vampire's wakefulness implies mummy's wakefulness), but not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot conclude that \"The vampire was awake\" is true. We can only say that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake, but we don't have enough information to determine whether the vampire is actually awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
