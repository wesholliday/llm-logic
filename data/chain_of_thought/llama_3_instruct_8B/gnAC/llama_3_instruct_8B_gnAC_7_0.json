This means that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (from statement 1)\n* Chris finished the race (from statement 2)\n\nSince Chris finished the race, it's possible that Alex also finished the race. However, there is no guarantee that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
