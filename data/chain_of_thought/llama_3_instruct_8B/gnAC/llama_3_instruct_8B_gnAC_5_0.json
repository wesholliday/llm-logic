This implies a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that Amy did play tennis.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that Jeff played basketball. The original statement only establishes a correlation between Jeff's basketball-playing and Amy's tennis-playing, but it does not provide direct evidence of Jeff's actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
