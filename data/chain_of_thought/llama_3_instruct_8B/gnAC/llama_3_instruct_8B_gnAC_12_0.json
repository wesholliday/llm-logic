It does not necessarily mean that they both did go to their respective places.\n\n2. \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n\nThis statement tells us that Lucy indeed went to the zoo, but it doesn't provide any information about Joe's actions.\n\nNow, let's analyze whether we can conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true:\n\nSince statement 1 implies a conditional relationship between Joe and Lucy's actions, we need to consider both possibilities:\n\na. If Joe did go to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo (by statement 1). Since we know Lucy went to the zoo (statement 2), this possibility seems plausible.\n\nb. However, there is another possibility: Joe might not have gone to the park. In this case, the conditional relationship in statement 1 wouldn't be satisfied, and we can't conclude anything about Joe's actions.\n\nSince we can't rule out the possibility that Joe didn't go to the park, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
