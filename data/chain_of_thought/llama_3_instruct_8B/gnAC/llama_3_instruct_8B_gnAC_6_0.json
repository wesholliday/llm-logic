This implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that Bob indeed chose pasta.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. The original statement only established a conditional relationship, not a direct correlation between the two choices. We cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza solely based on Bob choosing pasta.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
