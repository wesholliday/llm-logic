Since the book is a mystery novel (from statement 2), and being written by James is sufficient for a book to be a mystery novel (from statement 1), it follows that the book must have been written by James in order to be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
