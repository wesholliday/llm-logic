It does not necessarily mean that the events are causally related or that they occur simultaneously.\n\n2. \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is true.\n\nThis statement provides additional information about the robot's actions, but it does not provide any direct evidence about the alien's actions.\n\nTo determine whether \"The alien visited Mars\" is true, we need to examine the conditional relationship between the two events. Since the robot visiting Jupiter is a consequence of the alien visiting Mars (according to the first statement), and we know that the robot did visit Jupiter (from the second statement), it implies that the alien must have visited Mars for the robot to visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that \"The alien visited Mars\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
