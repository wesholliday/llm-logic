This means that if the wug is not flooped, then it must be bimmed (since there are only two possibilities).\n\nHowever, from statement 2, we know that the wug might not be bimmed. This implies that there is a possibility that the wug is neither flooped nor bimmed.\n\nSince we have established that if the wug is not flooped, then it must be bimmed (from statement 1), and we also know that the wug might not be bimmed (from statement 2), we can conclude that the wug is indeed flooped. This is because if the wug were not flooped, then it would have to be bimmed, but since it might not be bimmed, this possibility is ruled out.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
