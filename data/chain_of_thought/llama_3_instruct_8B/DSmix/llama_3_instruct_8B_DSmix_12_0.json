Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped (This statement implies that there are only two possibilities for the state of the smip: either it is shripped or it is lupped.)\n2. The smip might not be lupped (This statement adds a new possibility, which is that the smip might not be lupped.)\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the smip could be shripped, but we cannot conclude for certain that it is shripped.\n\nHowever, if we combine the first statement with the second statement, we get:\n\nEither the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\nThe smip might not be lupped\n\nThis implies that the smip is indeed shripped. If it were not shripped, then it would have to be lupped, but since it might not be lupped, the only remaining possibility is that it is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
