However, statement 2 tells us that the glip might not be tragged. This means that there is a possibility that the glip will not be tragged.\n\nSince the glip might not be tragged, it's possible that it is actually slogged (since it can't be both tragged and slogged at the same time). Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
