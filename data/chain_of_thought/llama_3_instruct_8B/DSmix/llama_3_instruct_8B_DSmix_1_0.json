This means that the second option in the first statement (\"it must be zargled\") is no longer certain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled (from statement 1).\n* However, we also know that the flugel might not be zargled (from statement 2). This means that the second option in the first statement (\"it must be zargled\") is no longer a possibility.\n* Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
