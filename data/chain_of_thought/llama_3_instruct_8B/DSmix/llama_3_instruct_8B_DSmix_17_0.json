This means that the first statement's second option (\"it must be movated\") is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the flob is skizzled:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. Statement 2 tells us that the flob might not be movated, which means that the second option (\"it must be movated\") is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the second option is no longer a possibility, we can focus on the first option: \"the flob is skizzled\". Since there are only two possibilities and one of them has been ruled out, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
