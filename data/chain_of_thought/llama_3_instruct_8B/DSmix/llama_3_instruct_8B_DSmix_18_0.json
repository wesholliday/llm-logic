However, we know that the shank \"might not be nugged\" (statement 2), which means that there is a possibility that it is not nugged.\n\nSince the shank cannot be both plooked and not nugged at the same time, and it might not be nugged, we can conclude that the shank must be plooked. If it were not plooked, then it would have to be nugged, but since it might not be nugged, this possibility is ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
