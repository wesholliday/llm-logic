From statement 2, we know that the fleeg might not be surned. This means that the possibility of the fleeg being surned is not certain.\n\nHowever, if the fleeg were not surned, then it would have to be bluttered (according to statement 1). Therefore, we can conclude that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
