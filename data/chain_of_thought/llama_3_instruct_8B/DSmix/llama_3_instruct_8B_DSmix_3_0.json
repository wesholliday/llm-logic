However, this does not provide any information about whether the splat is morphed or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This means that if the splat is not quanked (as stated in statement 2), then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
