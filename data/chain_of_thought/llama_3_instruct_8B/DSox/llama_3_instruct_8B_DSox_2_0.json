Since we already know from statement (1) that the wug is not bimmed, we can conclude that the second option \"it is bimmed\" must be false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the disjunction again: either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed. We've eliminated the second option, so the only remaining possibility is that the wug is indeed flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
