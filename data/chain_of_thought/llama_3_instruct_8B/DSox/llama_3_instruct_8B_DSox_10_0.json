Since we already know from statement (1) that the wug is not garpled, we can conclude that the second option (\"it is garpled\") must be false.\n\nNow, let's apply the law of excluded middle to the disjunction: if a statement is not true, its negation must be true. Therefore, since \"the wug is garpled\" is false, its negation \"the wug is sproinged\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
