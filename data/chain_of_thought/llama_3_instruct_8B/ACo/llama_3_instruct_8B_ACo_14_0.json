The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf being in the den) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that the wolf was indeed in the den (\"The wolf was in the den\").\n4. This means that the condition of the second statement (the bear being in the cave) does not need to be true for the consequence (the wolf being in the den) to hold.\n\nIn other words, we cannot conclude that the bear was in the cave simply because the wolf was in the den. The presence of the wolf in the den could be due to many reasons, and we don't have enough information to infer the presence of the bear in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
