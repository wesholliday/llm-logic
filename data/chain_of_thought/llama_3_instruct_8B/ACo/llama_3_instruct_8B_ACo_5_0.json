The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"Amy played tennis\" is true, we can infer that the condition \"If Jeff played basketball\" must also be true.\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Jeff actually played basketball. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would play tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer that \"Jeff played basketball\". We can only conclude that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
