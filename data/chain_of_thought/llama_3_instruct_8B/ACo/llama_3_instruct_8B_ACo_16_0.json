The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n3. We are given that the pants were indeed denim (\"The pants were denim\").\n4. Since the pants being denim is the consequent of the conditional statement, and we know it's true, this means that the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
