The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that the robot did visit Jupiter (\"The robot visited Jupiter\").\n4. From this, we can conclude that the condition \"If the alien visited Mars\" must have been true, because if it weren't true, the robot wouldn't have visited Jupiter (according to the conditional statement).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the alien did visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
