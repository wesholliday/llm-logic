We are also given the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This means that if Sue chose pizza, it is necessarily true that Bob chose pasta.\n3. However, we don't know whether Sue actually chose pizza or not. The information only tells us what would happen if she did choose pizza.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about Sue's choice, we cannot infer that \"Sue chose pizza\" from the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
