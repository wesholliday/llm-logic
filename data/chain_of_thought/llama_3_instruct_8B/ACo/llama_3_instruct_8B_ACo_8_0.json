The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n3. We are given the fact that \"The mummy was awake\", which means we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement is indeed true (i.e., the vampire was awake).\n4. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer that the consequence is also true, i.e., \"The mummy was awake\" implies \"The vampire was awake\".\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
