The second statement is an if-then statement, which means that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n3. We are given that Erin took a train, which matches the consequence of the if-then statement.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam took a plane, because if he didn't take a plane, Erin wouldn't have taken a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
