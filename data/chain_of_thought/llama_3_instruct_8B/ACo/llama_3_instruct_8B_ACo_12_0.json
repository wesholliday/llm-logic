The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. We know that the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) is indeed true, since we have evidence for it in the first statement (\"Lucy went to the zoo\").\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition (Joe going to the park) must also be true, since the conditional statement implies a logical connection between the two.\n5. Hence, we can infer that \"Joe went to the park\" is likely to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
