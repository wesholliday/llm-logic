The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\n3. However, we don't know whether the antecedent is true or not. We only have information about the consequent, which is \"The truck was blue\".\n\n4. Since we can't determine the truth value of the antecedent (\"If the car was red\"), we can't infer the conclusion \"The car was red\" from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
