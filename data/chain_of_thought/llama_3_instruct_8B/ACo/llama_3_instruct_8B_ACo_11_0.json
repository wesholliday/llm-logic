The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that the muffins were indeed blueberry (\"The muffins were blueberry\").\n4. Since the muffins being blueberry is a consequence of the cake being chocolate (according to the second statement), we can infer that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must have been chocolate.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
