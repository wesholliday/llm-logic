We have two statements:\n\t* \"The book is a mystery novel\" (premise)\n\t* \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (hypothesis)\n2. The hypothesis states that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel.\n3. We are given the premise that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n4. From this premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis must be true, since the book being a mystery novel is a necessary condition for it to have been written by James (according to the hypothesis).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
