The second statement is an implication (if-then) and can be rewritten as: \"Alex finished the race \u2192 Chris finished the race\" (read as \"if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\")\n3. We know that Chris did finish the race (\"Chris finished the race\")\n4. Using modus ponens (a valid logical rule), we can conclude that:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\n\t* Chris finished the race\n\t* Therefore, Alex must have finished the race\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"Alex finishes the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
