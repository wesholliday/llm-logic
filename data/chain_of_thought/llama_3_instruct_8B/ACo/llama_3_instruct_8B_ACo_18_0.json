The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n3. We are given additional information: \"The truck was metal\". This tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement is indeed true.\n4. Since the consequence is true, we can infer that the condition must also be true. In other words, if the truck is metal, then it's possible that the doll is plastic (but not necessarily true).\n5. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The doll was plastic\" because there might be other possibilities where the truck is metal but the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
