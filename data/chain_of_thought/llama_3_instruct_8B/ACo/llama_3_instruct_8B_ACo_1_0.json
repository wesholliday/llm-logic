The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n3. We are given additional information: \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n4. This new information allows us to conclude that the condition in the conditional statement (\"Mary was at the wedding\") is not necessarily true. However, it does not provide any direct evidence for or against Mary being at the wedding.\n5. Since we cannot determine whether Mary was at the wedding based on the given information, we cannot infer \"Mary was at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: no",
