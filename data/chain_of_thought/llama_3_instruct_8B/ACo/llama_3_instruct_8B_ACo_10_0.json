The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n3. We are given information that supports the condition: \"The cat was outside\". This means that the cat's location is consistent with the condition in the second statement.\n4. Since the condition is true and the consequence follows logically from it, we can conclude that the dog was not inside (otherwise, the cat would not be outside).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dog was inside\" is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
