The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\n3. However, we don't know whether the antecedent \"The apple was red\" is actually true or not. We only have information about the banana's color.\n\n4. Since we can't determine the truth value of the antecedent, we can't conclude that the consequent (the banana being yellow) is necessarily true due to the conditional statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
