This can be represented as a disjunction: (A \u2228 B)\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This can be represented as the negation of the second part of the disjunction: \u00acB\n3. From the first premise, we know that either A or B is true.\n4. From the second premise, we know that B is false (since it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed).\n5. Since B is false, and we know that either A or B is true, we can conclude that A must be true.\n\nThe conclusion states that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, which corresponds to the first part of the disjunction (A).\n\nSince we've logically deduced the conclusion from the premises, this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
