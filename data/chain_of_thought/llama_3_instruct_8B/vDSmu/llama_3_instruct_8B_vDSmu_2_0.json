            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This can be represented as a disjunction: P \u2228 Q, where P = \"the book is on the shelf\" and Q = \"the book must be resting on the table\".\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This can be represented as \u00acQ.\n3. The conclusion is that the book is on the shelf, which is P.\n\nUsing logical operators, we can rewrite the argument as:\n\n(P \u2228 Q) \u2227 \u00acQ \u22a2 P\n\nThis is a valid form of argument, known as modus tollens. It's a rule of inference that states if we have a disjunction (P \u2228 Q) and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), then we can conclude that P must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
