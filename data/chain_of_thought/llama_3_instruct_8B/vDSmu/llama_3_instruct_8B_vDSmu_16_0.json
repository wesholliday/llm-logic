The first premise states that either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\"\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can deduce that:\n\n* If the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk (by modus tollens)\n* But since it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk, this means that the pen cannot be on my desk\n* Therefore, the pen must be in my bag\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is valid because it uses a correct application of modus tollens and avoids any logical fallacies.\n\nAnswer: yes",
