However, this doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise only says that if Ann exercised, it means she didn't exercise strenuously. It doesn't say anything about exercising strenuously implying no exercise at all.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where Ann exercises moderately, which is not strenuous. The premise would be true in this case (Ann exercised, but did not exercise strenuously). However, the conclusion would still be false (Ann exercised, but it was moderate, not strenuous).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
