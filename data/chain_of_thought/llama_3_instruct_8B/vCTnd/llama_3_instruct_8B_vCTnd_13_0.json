However, this contradicts the premise \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\", which implies that exercising is possible but only in moderation.\n\nThe problem here is that the conclusion is trying to draw a stronger conclusion than what the premise allows. The premise only says that if Alex exercised, it was not much, but it doesn't say anything about exercising a lot or not exercising at all.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because it tries to derive a stronger conclusion from weaker premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
