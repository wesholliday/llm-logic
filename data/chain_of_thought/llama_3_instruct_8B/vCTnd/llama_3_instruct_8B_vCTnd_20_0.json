But the premise only talks about the relationship between a recommendation being made and it being strong or not.\n\nTo make this argument valid, we would need an additional premise that connects the strength of the recommendation with the conclusion. For example:\n\nPremise: If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation\nPremise: If a strong recommendation was made, then no other recommendation was made\nConclusion: If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\n\nWith these two premises, we can logically conclude that if a strong recommendation was made, then only one recommendation was made (the strong one), and therefore, it's true that a non-strong recommendation was not made.\n\nHowever, the original argument provided does not have this additional premise. Therefore, I would say:\n\nAnswer: no",
