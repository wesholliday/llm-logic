However, the premise only talks about eating a meal and not eating a large meal, but it doesn't provide any information about eating a large meal.\n\nTo make this argument logically valid, we would need an additional premise that connects the conclusion to the premise. For example:\n\nPremise 1: If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\nPremise 2: If I didn't eat a large meal, then I ate a meal\nConclusion: If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\n\nWith these two premises, we can logically conclude that if I ate a large meal, it implies that I didn't eat a meal.\n\nHowever, the original argument provided only one premise, which is insufficient to support the conclusion. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
