            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice (P1)\nConclusion: If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered (C)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nFrom P1, we can infer that if advice was offered, it must be non-helpful. This implies that there are two possibilities:\n\n1. Advice was offered and it was helpful.\n2. Advice was offered and it was not helpful.\n\nThe argument does not provide any information about the first possibility (advice being both offered and helpful). However, P1 explicitly states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful. This means we can rule out the first possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the second possibility: Advice was offered and it was not helpful. In this case, P1 is true, as the advice was indeed not helpful.\n\nThe argument then concludes that if helpful advice was offered (which is the opposite of what happened in our scenario), then advice was not offered. This seems to be a valid conclusion based on the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument appears to be logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
