This seems counterintuitive and contradictory.\n\nTo determine validity, we can use a truth table:\n\n| Issue Addressed | Effective |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | True | False |\n| True | False | True |\n| False | True | ? |\n| False | False | ? |\n\nThe conclusion is trying to say that if the issue was addressed effectively (True), then it wasn't addressed (False). However, this would mean that the issue was both addressed and not addressed at the same time, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid. The truth table shows that there are no possible combinations of values for \"Issue Addressed\" and \"Effective\" that would make the conclusion logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
