In other words, can we deduce the conclusion solely based on the premise without any additional information?\n\nThe key step here is to recognize that the premise and conclusion are actually negations of each other. The premise states that \"if the job was completed, then it was not completed well\", which implies that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed (since \"not completed\" is equivalent to \"completed poorly\"). This means that the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid.",
