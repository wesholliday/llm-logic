However, this seems counterintuitive and contradictory.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, let's try to negate the premises:\n\nNegation of premise 1: Instructions were given, but they were explained clearly\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" is actually true in this case. This means that the original argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
