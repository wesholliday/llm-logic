The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not-B, then not-A\". In this case, the contrapositive of P1 would be \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did study\".\n\nHowever, the conclusion C states the opposite: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\". This means that the argument is actually invalid because it does not follow the correct logical structure.\n\nAnswer: no",
