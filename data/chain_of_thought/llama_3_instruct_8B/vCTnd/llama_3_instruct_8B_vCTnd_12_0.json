This can be rewritten as \"\u00ac(Jane studied) \u2192 \u00ac(Jane studied long)\".\n\nNotice that both statements have the same form: \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\", where A is the antecedent and B is the consequent. This is a valid form of argument, known as modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
