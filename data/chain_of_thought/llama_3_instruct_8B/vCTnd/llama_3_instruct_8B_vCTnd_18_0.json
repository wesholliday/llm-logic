This seems counterintuitive, as discussing something in depth typically implies a thorough examination of the topic.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, let's examine its structure:\n\n1. The premise states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\n2. The conclusion tries to say that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is trying to make a statement about discussing something in depth, but the premise only talks about discussing an issue (without specifying whether it's in depth or not). This creates a disconnect between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the conclusion seems to be saying that if an issue is thoroughly examined, then it wasn't actually talked about. This is a contradictory statement, as discussing something in depth implies that you are indeed talking about it.\n\nGiven these issues with the argument's structure and logic, I conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
