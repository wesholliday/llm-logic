But the premise says that if the room was cleaned, then something bad happened (it wasn't cleaned thoroughly).\n\nNotice that the premises and conclusions are talking about different things. The premise talks about \"cleaned\" and \"not cleaned thoroughly\", while the conclusion talks about \"cleaned thoroughly\" and \"not cleaned\". This is a classic case of equivocation.\n\nEquivocation occurs when a word or phrase has multiple meanings, and one meaning is used in the premise and another meaning is used in the conclusion. In this case, \"cleaned\" means different things in the premise and conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because it relies on an equivocation.\n\nAnswer: no",
