However, this doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if a customer was greeted, it means they weren't greeted warmly. This implies that there's a possibility of being greeted without being greeted warmly. The conclusion is trying to flip this around and say that if someone was greeted warmly, it means they weren't greeted at all. But this is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where a customer is greeted with a smile and a warm hello. In this case, the customer was both greeted and greeted warmly. The premise doesn't rule out this possibility, so the conclusion can't be logically deduced from it.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
