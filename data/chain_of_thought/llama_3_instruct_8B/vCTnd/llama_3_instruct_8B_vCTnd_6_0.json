However, this seems counterintuitive because washing properly typically means doing a good job of cleaning the clothes.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, let's examine the premise and see how it relates to the conclusion. The premise states that if the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly. This implies that there is an inverse relationship between being washed and being washed properly.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This statement seems to contradict the original premise because it suggests that washing properly means not washing at all.\n\nGiven this analysis, I conclude that the argument is logically invalid. The premise and conclusion are contradictory, which makes the argument fallacious.\n\nAnswer: no",
