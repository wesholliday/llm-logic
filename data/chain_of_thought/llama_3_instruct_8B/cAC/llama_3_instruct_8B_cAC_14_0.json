We have two statements:\n\t* If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (conditional statement)\n\t* The wolf was in the den (additional information)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the bear is indeed in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den.\n\n3. However, this does not guarantee that the bear is actually in the cave. We only know that if it were true, then the wolf would be in the den.\n\n4. The second statement tells us that the wolf was indeed in the den, but this doesn't provide any direct information about the bear's location.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the bear was in the cave based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
