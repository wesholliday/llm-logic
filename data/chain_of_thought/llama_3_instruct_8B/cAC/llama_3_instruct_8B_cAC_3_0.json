We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* The book is a mystery novel (fact)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n3. Now, we have the fact that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n4. Since the book is a mystery novel, and from our previous inference, we know that if the book was written by James, it would also be a mystery novel... \n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the book must have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
