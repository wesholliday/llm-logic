We have two statements:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (conditional statement)\n\t* Chris finished the race (additional information)\n2. The conditional statement implies that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish the race.\n3. Since we know that Chris finished the race, we can conclude that Chris's finishing the race is a result of Alex finishing the race (or possibly due to some other reason).\n4. However, we cannot directly conclude that Alex finished the race from the given information.\n\nThe conditional statement only provides a relationship between Alex and Chris's finishes, but it does not guarantee that Alex actually finished the race. There might be another scenario where Chris finished the race for some other reason, unrelated to Alex's finish.\n\nAnswer: no",
