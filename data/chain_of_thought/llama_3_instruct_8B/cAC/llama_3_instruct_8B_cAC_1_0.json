We have two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Sue was at the wedding (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if Mary is indeed at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding.\n3. Now, we have a new piece of information: Sue was at the wedding. This means that the condition in the original conditional statement is fulfilled (Sue being at the wedding).\n4. Since the condition is met, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
