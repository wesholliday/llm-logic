The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n3. However, we don't know whether Sue chose pizza or not. We only know that Bob chose pasta.\n4. Since we don't have enough information to conclude that Sue chose pizza, we cannot make a definitive statement about Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
