The first statement is an implication (if-then), which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n3. We know that the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is indeed true, as stated in the second statement.\n4. However, we cannot conclude that the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true. The implication only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball, but it doesn't say anything about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Tom watched football'.\n\nAnswer: no",
