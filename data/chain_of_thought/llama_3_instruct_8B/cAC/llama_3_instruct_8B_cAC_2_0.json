We have two premises:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (conditional statement)\n\t* The unicorn was in the forest (fact)\n\n2. From the second premise, we can conclude that the condition of the first premise is met: \"the unicorn was in the forest\" matches the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\".\n\n3. Since the condition is met, we can apply the conditional statement to infer the conclusion:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest (condition met), then the unicorn was in the forest\n\t* Therefore, the griffin was in the forest\n\nAnswer: yes",
