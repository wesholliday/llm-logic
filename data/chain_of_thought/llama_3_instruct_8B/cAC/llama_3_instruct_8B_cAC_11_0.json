From statement 2, we know that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only becomes true if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is met.\n4. Since we know that the muffins are blueberry (from statement 2), this doesn't necessarily mean that the cake is chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry for some other reason, not because of the cake's flavor.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
