We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The mummy was awake (additional information)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is true, then the conclusion \"the mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\n3. Now, we have additional information: \"The mummy was awake\". This tells us that the condition in the conditional statement is indeed true (i.e., the mummy is awake).\n\n4. Since the condition is true, and the conditional statement says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, we can conclude that:\n\n\t* The vampire must be awake as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
