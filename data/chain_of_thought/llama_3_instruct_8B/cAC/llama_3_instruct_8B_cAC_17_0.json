The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n3. However, we don't know whether Ben ate pasta or not. We only know that Kate ate salad.\n4. Since we don't have enough information to conclude that Ben ate pasta, we cannot logically deduce that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
