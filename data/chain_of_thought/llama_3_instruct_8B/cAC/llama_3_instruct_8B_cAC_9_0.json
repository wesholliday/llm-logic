We have two statements:\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (conditional statement)\n\t* Mark bought the blue shirt (factual statement)\n2. From the second statement, we know that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt.\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n4. However, we don't know whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. We only know that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n5. Since we don't have enough information to conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt, we cannot logically deduce it from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
