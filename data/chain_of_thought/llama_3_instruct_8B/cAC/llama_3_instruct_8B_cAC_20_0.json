We have two statements:\n\t* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (conditional statement)\n\t* The banana was yellow (fact)\n\n2. From the fact \"The banana was yellow\", we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement is true: the banana is indeed yellow.\n\n3. Now, we need to see what conclusion we can draw from the conditional statement given that the condition is true. The conditional statement says \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". Since the banana is yellow, it implies that the apple must have been red for this statement to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and logical deduction, we can conclude that the apple was indeed red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
