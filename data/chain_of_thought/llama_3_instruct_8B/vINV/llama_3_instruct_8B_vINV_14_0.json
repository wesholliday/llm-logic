To do this, it's using the premise as a kind of \"mirror image\" or inverse.\n\nNotice that the premise doesn't explicitly state what happens when the bear is NOT in the cave. It only talks about what happens when the bear IS in the cave. However, we can use logical reasoning to infer something about the opposite case (bear not in the cave).\n\nIf the bear being in the cave implies the wolf being in the den, then it's reasonable to assume that the bear NOT being in the cave would imply the wolf NOT being in the den.\n\nThis is because the relationship between the bear and the cave seems to be a necessary condition for the wolf being in the den. If the bear is present, then the wolf must also be present (according to the premise). Therefore, if the bear is absent, it's likely that the wolf would also be absent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
