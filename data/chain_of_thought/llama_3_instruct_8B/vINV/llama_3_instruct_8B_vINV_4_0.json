However, the original premise only states that if the alien visits Mars, the robot visits Jupiter. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars.\n\nTo make this argument logically valid, we would need an additional premise that establishes a relationship between the alien's absence from Mars and the robot's absence from Jupiter. Without such a premise, we cannot logically conclude that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, I conclude:\n\nAnswer: no",
