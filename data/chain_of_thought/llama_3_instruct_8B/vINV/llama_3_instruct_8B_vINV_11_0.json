To do this, it's using the premise as a starting point.\n\nNotice that the premise doesn't explicitly state what happens when the cake is not chocolate. It only talks about what happens when the cake is chocolate (i.e., the muffins are blueberry).\n\nHowever, we can use logical deduction to infer what might happen when the cake is not chocolate. If the cake being chocolate implies the muffins being blueberry, then it's reasonable to assume that the opposite would also hold true: if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are likely not blueberry.\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement (if-then) and applies the same condition to both the premise and conclusion. The conclusion follows logically from the premise, even though it's not explicitly stated in the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
