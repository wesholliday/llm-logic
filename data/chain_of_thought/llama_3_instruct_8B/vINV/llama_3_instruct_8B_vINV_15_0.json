To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to examine how the premises relate to each other.\n\nThe original premise states that if Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train. This implies that there is an inverse relationship between their modes of transportation: when Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion. If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This seems to follow logically from the original premise, as it maintains the inverse relationship between their modes of transportation.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
