To do this, we need to consider two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Joe goes to the park (P)\n2. Joe does not go to the park (~P)\n\nUsing the premise, if Joe goes to the park (P), then Lucy goes to the zoo (Z). This is represented as P \u2192 Z.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: If Joe did not go to the park (~P), then Lucy did not go to the zoo (~Z).\n\nWe can rephrase this conclusion as: ~P \u2192 ~Z\n\nNotice that the conclusion is trying to establish a conditional relationship between the negation of Joe going to the park and the negation of Lucy going to the zoo. However, the premise only provides information about the relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, not about their negations.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that we cannot logically conclude the negation of one statement from the original conditional statement. The premise does not provide enough information to establish a valid conclusion about the negations.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: no",
