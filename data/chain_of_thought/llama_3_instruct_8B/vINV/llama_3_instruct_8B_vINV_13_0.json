This implies a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue. To evaluate this, we need to consider the opposite of the original premise:\n\nIf the car was NOT red, then the truck was NOT blue (by contraposition)\n\nThis is equivalent to saying: If the truck WAS blue, then the car WAS NOT red\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\nIf the truck was blue, then the car was not red\n\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. The first statement implies that if the car is not red, then the truck cannot be blue (since it would contradict the original premise). Similarly, the second statement implies that if the truck is blue, then the car cannot be red (again, since it would contradict the original premise).\n\nSince both statements are logically equivalent and consistent with each other, we can conclude that this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
