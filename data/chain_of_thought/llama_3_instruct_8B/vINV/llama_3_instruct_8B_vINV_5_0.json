This can be rewritten as \"(Jeff played basketball) \u2192 (Amy played tennis)\".\n\nUsing the modus tollens rule, we can conclude that if the antecedent of the premise is false (i.e., Jeff did not play basketball), then the consequent must also be false (i.e., Amy did not play tennis).\n\nTherefore, the argument follows a logically valid structure:\n\nNot (Jeff played basketball) \u2192 Not (Amy played tennis)\n\nAnswer: yes",
