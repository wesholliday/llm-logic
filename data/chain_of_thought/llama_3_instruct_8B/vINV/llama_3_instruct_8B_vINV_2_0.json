The conclusion seems to be the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In this case, the premise is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\", so its contrapositive would be \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\", which is not exactly the same as the contrapositive of the premise. It seems that the argument is trying to use a different logical structure.\n\nUnfortunately, this means that the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
