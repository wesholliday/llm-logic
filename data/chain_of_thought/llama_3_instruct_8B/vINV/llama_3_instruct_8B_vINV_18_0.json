            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\nConclusion: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the correct logical structure.\n\nThe premise is an \"if-then\" statement, which can be rewritten as:\n\nIf P (the doll is plastic), then Q (the truck is metal)\n\nThis implies that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. This is a conditional statement with a specific relationship between P and Q.\n\nNow, let's look at the conclusion: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nIf ~P (the doll is not plastic), then ~Q (the truck is not metal)\n\nUsing the same logic as before, this implies that whenever ~P is true, ~Q must also be true.\n\nNotice a pattern? The conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. In other words, it's saying that if the condition for P being true is not met (~P), then the condition for Q being true is also not met (~Q).\n\nThis is a valid logical structure! If we assume the original premise is true, then the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
