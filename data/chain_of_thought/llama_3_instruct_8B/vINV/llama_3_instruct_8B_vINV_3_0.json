The premise states that if the book was written by James, it's a mystery novel. This implies that if the book wasn't written by James, it wouldn't be a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this argument is logically valid. A logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, without any possibility of contradiction or exception.\n\nIn this case, the argument seems to be logically valid because it's using a conditional statement (if-then) and its negation (not-if). The premise sets up a condition for something to be true (the book being written by James), and the conclusion follows from that condition. If we negate the premise (the book is not written by James), the conclusion logically follows.\n\nTherefore, I conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
