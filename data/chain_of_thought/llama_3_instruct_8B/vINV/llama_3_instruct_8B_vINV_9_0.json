The conclusion seems to be the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In this case, the premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\", so its contrapositive would be \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nThe conclusion \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" seems to be equivalent to this contrapositive. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
