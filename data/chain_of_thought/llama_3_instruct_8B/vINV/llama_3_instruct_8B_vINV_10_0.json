The conclusion seems to be trying to make a statement about the relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location when the dog is not inside.\n\nNotice that the premise only talks about what happens when the dog is inside, but the conclusion tries to make a statement about what happens when the dog is not inside. This creates a problem because we don't have any information about what happens when the dog is not inside in the original premise.\n\nIn other words, the premise doesn't provide enough information to logically conclude that if the dog is not inside, then the cat was not outside. The conclusion is trying to make an inference that goes beyond what's stated in the premise.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
