This implies a conditional relationship between Alex's finishing the race and Chris's finishing the race.\n\nThe conclusion attempts to draw an inference from the negation of the antecedent (Alex not finishing the race) to the negation of the consequent (Chris not finishing the race). In other words, it claims that if Alex does not finish the race, then Chris also does not finish the race.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not logically valid because it relies on an invalid inference. The premise only establishes a relationship between Alex's finishing the race and Chris's finishing the race, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Alex does not finish the race.\n\nIn other words, the premise does not imply that if Alex does not finish the race, then Chris also does not finish the race. There could be scenarios where Alex does not finish the race, but Chris still finishes the race.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
