This is a conditional statement with a positive antecedent (Mary) and a consequent (Sue).\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It's another \"if-then\" statement:\n\n\u00acMary \u2192 \u00acSue\n\nThis means that if Mary is not present, then Sue must also not be present.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is logically equivalent to the original premise. In other words, the conclusion can be derived directly from the premise by applying the same logical structure.\n\nSince the argument follows a consistent and correct logical structure, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
