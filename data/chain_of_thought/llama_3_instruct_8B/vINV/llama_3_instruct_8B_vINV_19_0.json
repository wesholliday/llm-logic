This can be rewritten as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\".\n\nUsing the modus tollens rule, we can infer that if the antecedent of the premise is false (i.e., Tom did not watch football), then the consequent must also be false (i.e., Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nTherefore, the argument follows a valid logical structure:\n\nNot (Tom watched football) \u2192 Not (Jen watched basketball)\n\nAnswer: yes",
