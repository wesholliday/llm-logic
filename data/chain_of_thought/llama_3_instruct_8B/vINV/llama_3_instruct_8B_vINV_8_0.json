This can be represented as:\n\nV \u2192 M (where V represents \"vampire is awake\" and M represents \"mummy is awake\")\n\nThe conclusion states that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake. This can be represented as:\n\n\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM\n\nNow, let's examine the argument structure:\n\n1. If V, then M (premise)\n2. If \u00acV, then \u00acM (conclusion)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the correct form of a conditional statement. Specifically, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is actually the contrapositive of the premise:\n\n\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM is equivalent to M \u2192 V\n\nThis means that if the mummy is awake (M), then the vampire must be awake (V). This is the same as saying that if the vampire is not awake (\u00acV), then the mummy cannot be awake (\u00acM).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
