            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\nConclusion: If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the correct logical structure.\n\nThe premise states that if a certain condition (the apple being red) holds true, then another condition (the banana being yellow) also holds true. This is an \"if-then\" statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A, then B\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, states that if the opposite of the initial condition (the apple not being red) holds true, then the opposite of the second condition (the banana not being yellow) also holds true. This can be represented as:\n\nIf \u00acA, then \u00acB\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of this argument. We have an \"if-then\" statement in both the premise and the conclusion. The only difference is that the premise has a positive condition (the apple being red), while the conclusion has a negative condition (the apple not being red).\n\nSince the premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, it implies that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. This is because the opposite of \"red\" is \"not red\", and the opposite of \"yellow\" is \"not yellow\".\n\nTherefore, this form of argument follows a logically valid structure, as it maintains consistency between the premise and conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
