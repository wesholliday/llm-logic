The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, which means there is a possibility that it's not being used as an option in statement (1).\n\nSince the scarf must be either draped on the coat rack or stuffed in my backpack, and it's possible that it's not being draped on the coat rack, we can conclude that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
