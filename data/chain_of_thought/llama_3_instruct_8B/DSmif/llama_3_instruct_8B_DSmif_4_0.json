We have two statements:\n\t* Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n\t* The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. From statement 2, we can conclude that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1 again: \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\". This means that there are only two possibilities for the cat's location:\n\t* Playing in the bedroom (which we've already ruled out)\n\t* Napping on the couch\n\n4. Since we've eliminated one possibility, and the other possibility is still left, we can conclude that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
