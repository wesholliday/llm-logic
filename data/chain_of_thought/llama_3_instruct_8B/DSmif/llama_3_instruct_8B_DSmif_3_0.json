The statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" gives us two possibilities for the location of the keys.\n2. The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" tells us that one of those possibilities is not true, which means the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Since we know the keys can't be dangling in the cabinet, and there are only two possibilities (dangling in the cabinet or in the drawer), it follows that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
