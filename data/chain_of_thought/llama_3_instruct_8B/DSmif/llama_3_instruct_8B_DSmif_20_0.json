We have two statements:\n\t* Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\t* The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not perched on her head (from statement 2).\n\n2. Since the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, it means that the first option in the original statement (\"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\") is not true.\n\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the second option in the original statement (\"they are in her bag\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
