The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" presents two mutually exclusive options:\n\t* Option A: The missing puzzle piece blends in on the floor.\n\t* Option B: The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\n2. We are given additional information: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\".\nThis statement contradicts Option A, which means that Option A is false.\n\n3. Since Option A is false, we can conclude that Option B must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
