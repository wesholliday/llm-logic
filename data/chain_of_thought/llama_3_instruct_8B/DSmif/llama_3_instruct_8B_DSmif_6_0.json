Since the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, we can conclude that it must be ringing in the living room (or else the disjunction would be false).\n\nHowever, the original statement only says \"it is in the living room\", which is a different condition from \"it's ringing\". We cannot infer that the phone is actually in the living room just because it's not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nAnswer: no",
