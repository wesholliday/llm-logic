The word \"either\" indicates that these are the only two possibilities.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that there is a possibility that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. Since we've already established that the book might not be resting on the table (from statement 1), this means that the second alternative (\"it must be resting on the table\") cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
