This means that the watch could potentially be on his wrist, but we can't rule out the possibility that it's not.\n\nNow, let's combine this information with statement (2). Since there are only two possibilities for the location of the watch, and one of those possibilities is that it might not be on his wrist (according to statement (1)), then the other possibility must be true: the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
