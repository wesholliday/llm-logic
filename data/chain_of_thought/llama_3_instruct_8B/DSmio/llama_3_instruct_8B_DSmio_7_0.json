The word \"either\" indicates that these are the only two possibilities.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the umbrella might not be in the closet.\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the umbrella is not in the closet, it must be in the car (since there are only two options).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
