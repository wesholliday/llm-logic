The second statement implies that there are only two possibilities: either Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden.\n3. Since we know that \"Fido might not be in the garden\", this means that it's possible for Fido to not be in the garden.\n4. Given that possibility, we can conclude that Fido must be inside (since he can't be in the garden).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
