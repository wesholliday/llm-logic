This means that the milk might be in the fridge, but it also might not be.\n\nNow, let's combine this information with statement (2). Since we know there are only two possible locations for the milk, and one of those possibilities is that it's on the counter, we can conclude that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge (as stated in statement 1), then it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
