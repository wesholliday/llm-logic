The word \"must\" implies that these are the only two possible locations for the remote control.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the remote control might not be hiding under the couch (statement 1), then there is a possibility that it is indeed on the coffee table (since statement 2 presents this as one of the two options).\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table. The statements only provide possibilities and do not rule out other locations.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
