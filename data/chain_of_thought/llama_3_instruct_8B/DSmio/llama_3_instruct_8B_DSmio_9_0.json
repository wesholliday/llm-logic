This implies that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nFrom (1), we know that \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\". This means there is a possibility that it's not blending in on the floor.\n\nIf this is the case, then from (2) we can infer that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box. Since it's not blending in on the floor, and either it's in the box or it must be blending in on the floor, it follows logically that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
