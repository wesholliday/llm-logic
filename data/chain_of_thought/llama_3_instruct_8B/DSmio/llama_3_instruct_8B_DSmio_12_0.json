This is because the statement says \"Either... or\", which means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nSo, combining the information from both statements, we can conclude that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet (which is a possibility), then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
