We have two statements:\n\t* \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\"\n\t* \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\"\n2. From the first statement, we know that there is a possibility (not certainty) that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n3. The second statement provides two alternatives: either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n4. Since we already know that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry (from statement 1), we can eliminate one of the alternatives: \"they must be hidden in the pantry\" is unlikely to be true.\n5. This leaves us with only one alternative: \"the cookies are in the jar\".\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
