This means that the second alternative (\"it must be playing in the bedroom\") might not be true.\n\nSince the second alternative is not necessarily true, it implies that the first alternative (\"the cat is napping on the couch\") could be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
