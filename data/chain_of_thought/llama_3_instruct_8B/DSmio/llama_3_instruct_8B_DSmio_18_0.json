This implies that if the notebook is not on the nightstand (as stated in statement 1), then it must be in the drawer.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\nIf the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, and either it's in the drawer or it has to be sitting on the nightstand, then it follows that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
