This means that the possibility of the scarf being draped on the coat rack is not certain.\n\nNow, let's combine this information with statement (2). Since the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, it's possible that it's actually stuffed in the backpack. The fact that it might not be draped on the coat rack doesn't rule out the possibility of it being in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
