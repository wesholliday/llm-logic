In other words, if you don't finish your homework, you cannot play video games.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional information: \"my computer catches on fire\". This has no direct relation to finishing homework or playing video games. It's an unrelated event that might prevent me from using my computer in general, but it doesn't affect the condition of finishing homework.\n\nSince finishing homework is still a necessary condition for playing video games, and the computer catching on fire doesn't change this condition, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
