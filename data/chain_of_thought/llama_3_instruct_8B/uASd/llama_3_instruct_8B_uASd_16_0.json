If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green.\n\nThis statement implies that fertilization is a necessary condition for having a lush and green lawn.\n\n2. If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought...\n\nThe presence of a drought introduces an additional factor that can affect the outcome.\n\n...it will be lush and green?\n\nTo infer whether the lawn will still be lush and green, we need to consider how the drought might impact the fertilizer's effectiveness. A drought could reduce the availability of water for the grass, making it difficult for the fertilizer to take effect.\n\nSince the fertilizer alone is not sufficient to guarantee a lush and green lawn in the presence of a drought, we cannot infer that the lawn will still be lush and green if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought. The drought introduces an additional variable that can affect the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
