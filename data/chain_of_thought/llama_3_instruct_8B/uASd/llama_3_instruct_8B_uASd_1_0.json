The match has been soaked in water.\n\nFrom statement (1), we know that striking the match is a necessary condition for it to light. However, statement (2) tells us that the match has been exposed to water, which can potentially extinguish or hinder the ignition process.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer with certainty whether the match will light if struck while soaked in water. The presence of water may prevent the match from igniting, even if it is struck. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
