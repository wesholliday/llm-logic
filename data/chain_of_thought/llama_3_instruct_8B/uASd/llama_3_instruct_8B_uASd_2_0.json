The implication is that going to the concert is necessary for having a good time.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional information: \"a bomb goes off\". This is an unexpected event that disrupts the original scenario. In this case, it's unlikely that we'll have a good time if a bomb goes off at the concert.\n\nThe original statement only guarantees a good time under the condition of going to the concert, not under any other circumstances. The presence of a bomb changes the situation entirely, making it impossible for us to infer that we'll still have a good time.\n\nAnswer: no",
