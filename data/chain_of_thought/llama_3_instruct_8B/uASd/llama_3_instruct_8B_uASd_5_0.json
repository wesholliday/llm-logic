This implies that paying the bill is a necessary condition for the services to continue.\n3. Now, let's consider the scenario where the bill is paid and the check bounces. In this case, the bill has been technically paid (the payment was made), but the payment method (the check) failed.\n4. Since the bill has been paid, according to the initial statement, the services should continue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will indeed continue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
