The package has shipped and was misrouted.\n\nFrom statement (1), we know that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today. However, this statement does not guarantee that the package will arrive today if it was misrouted.\n\nMisrouting could mean that the package is not on its intended path to arrive at the destination. In this case, even though the package has shipped, it may not actually arrive today due to the misrouting.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and was misrouted, then it will still arrive today.\n\nAnswer: no",
