The statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" implies a causal relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired.\n2. This means that if we add another condition (in this case, doing hard labor) to the original statement, we need to ensure that it doesn't disrupt the causal relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired.\n\nHowever, doing hard labor can potentially make someone tired, regardless of how much sleep they get. Therefore, adding \"and do hard labor\" to the original statement does not necessarily guarantee that you won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: no",
