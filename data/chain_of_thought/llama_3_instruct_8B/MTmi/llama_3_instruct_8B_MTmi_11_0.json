This implies that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins might not be blueberry.\n3. We are given a new statement: \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\".\n4. From this, we can conclude that it's possible for the muffins to not be blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the original statement again: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\". If the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins might not be blueberry (from step 2).\n\nSince we know that the muffins might not be blueberry (step 3), it's possible for the cake to not be chocolate. This is because if the muffins are not blueberry, it doesn't necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
