We are given two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Sue might not have been at the wedding (possibility statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding.\n3. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is NOT at the wedding. The conditional statement only talks about the relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding when both are present.\n4. The second statement tells us that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which means there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n5. Since we don't know whether Sue was or wasn't at the wedding, we cannot infer anything about Mary's presence at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
