            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This implies that if Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark will buy the blue shirt.\n2. The second statement is \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\", which means there's a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about Lisa buying the red shirt:\n\n* If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt (from step 1).\n* But we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (from step 2). This means it's possible that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n* Since Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, he wouldn't have bought it even if Lisa had bought the red shirt. This contradicts our initial assumption that Mark would have bought the blue shirt if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If she had, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it's more likely that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
