We are given two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The mummy might not have been awake (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the mummy might not be awake, which contradicts the conclusion from step 2.\n4. Since the mummy might not be awake, it's possible that the vampire was not awake either (because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would have been awake too).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
