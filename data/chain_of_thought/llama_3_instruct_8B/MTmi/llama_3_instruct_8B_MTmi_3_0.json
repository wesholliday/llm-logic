We have two statements:\n\t* If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel (conditional statement)\n\t* The book might not be a mystery novel (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book is written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel, which contradicts the first statement's assumption.\n4. Since the book might not be a mystery novel, it means that the condition \"the book was written by James\" is not necessarily true.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
