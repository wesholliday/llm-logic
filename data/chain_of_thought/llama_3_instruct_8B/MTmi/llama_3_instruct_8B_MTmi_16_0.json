This implies that if the shirt is indeed cotton, then the pants are definitely denim.\n3. However, we also know that \"The pants might not have been denim\", which means there's a possibility that the pants are not denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\". If this were true, it would mean that the shirt is not cotton, and therefore, the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" wouldn't apply. In other words, we can't conclude anything about the pants being denim or not.\n\nHowever, since we know that the pants might not be denim (from step 3), it's possible that they are indeed denim, even if the shirt is not cotton. This means that the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" doesn't necessarily follow from the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
