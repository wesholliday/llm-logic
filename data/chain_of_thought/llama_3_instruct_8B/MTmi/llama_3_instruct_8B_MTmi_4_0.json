We are given two statements:\n\t* If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\t* The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\n2. From statement 1, we can conclude that if the alien did visit Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter. However, this does not mean that the robot actually visited Jupiter.\n\n3. Statement 2 tells us that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the original statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\". If we assume the alien did visit Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter (from step 2). However, since the robot might not have visited Jupiter (from step 3), this means that the alien cannot have visited Mars.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
