We are given two statements:\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest (conditional statement)\n\t* The unicorn might not have been in the forest (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin is indeed in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the unicorn might not have been in the forest, which contradicts the conclusion drawn from the first statement.\n4. Since the two statements are contradictory, we cannot conclude anything about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
