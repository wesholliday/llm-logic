We are given two statements:\n\t* If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\t* The truck might not have been metal.\n\n2. From statement 1, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. But this does not mean that if the truck is not metal, then the doll cannot be plastic.\n\n3. Statement 2 tells us that the truck might not have been metal, which means it's possible that the truck is not metal.\n\n4. Since we don't know for sure whether the truck is metal or not, we can't conclude anything about the doll being plastic or not based on statement 1 and 2 alone.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
