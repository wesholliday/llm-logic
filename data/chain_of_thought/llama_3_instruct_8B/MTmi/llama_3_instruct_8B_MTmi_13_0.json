This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. We are given an additional statement: \"The truck might not have been blue\". This statement is saying that it's possible for the truck to not be blue.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about the car:\n\n* If we assume the car was red (which would make the antecedent of the original statement true), then the consequent would also be true, and the truck must have been blue.\n* But wait, we just said that the truck might not have been blue. This means that it's possible for the truck to not be blue, which contradicts our previous conclusion.\n\nThis contradiction tells us that our initial assumption (the car being red) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
