            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n2. We are given an additional statement: \"The banana might not have been yellow\". This statement is saying that it's possible for the banana to not be yellow.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about the apple:\n\n* If we assume the apple was red (antecedent), then according to the original statement, the banana must have been yellow (consequent).\n* But wait, we just learned that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that our assumption about the banana being yellow is not necessarily true.\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude for certain that the apple was red.\n\nSo, can we infer \"The apple was not red\"?\n\nAnswer: yes",
