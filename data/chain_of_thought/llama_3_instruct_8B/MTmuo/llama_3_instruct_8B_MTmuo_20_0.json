            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" (\u00acB)\n\t* \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" (A \u2192 B)\n\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if the apple is not red (\u223cA), then it doesn't matter what color the banana was, because the condition A \u2192 B is not satisfied.\n\n3. Statement 1 tells us that the banana's color is irrelevant to its being yellow (\u00acB). This means that even if the apple is red, the banana could still be any other color except yellow.\n\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the apple is not red (\u223cA), then it doesn't matter what color the banana was, because the condition A \u2192 B is not satisfied, and the banana's color is irrelevant to its being yellow (\u00acB).\n\n5. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The apple was not red\" (\u223cA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
