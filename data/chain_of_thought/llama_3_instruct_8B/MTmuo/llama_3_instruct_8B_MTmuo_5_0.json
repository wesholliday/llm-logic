The second statement says \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\". This is a conditional statement, which implies that if Jeff plays basketball, Amy will definitely play tennis.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\n* If Jeff played basketball (which we don't know yet), then Amy would have to play tennis.\n* But it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This means that there is at least one possibility where Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that if Jeff did play basketball, Amy wouldn't have played tennis (because it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis). And since the second statement implies that if Jeff plays basketball, Amy will definitely play tennis, we can conclude that:\n\n* If Jeff played basketball, then Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nThis means that Jeff did not play basketball. Otherwise, Amy would have had to play tennis, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
