            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" (\u00acB)\n\t* \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" (R \u2192 B)\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if the car is not red, then the truck does not have to be blue. This can be written as \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB.\n3. Now, let's combine statements 1 and 2 using logical operators:\n\t* \u00acB (from statement 1)\n\t* \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB (from statement 2)\n\t* Using modus tollens, we can infer that if \u00acR is true, then \u00acB must also be true.\n4. Since we want to infer \"The car was not red\" (\u00acR), we need to show that it follows logically from the given statements.\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive \u00acR from the given statements:\n\n* We know that \u00acB is true (from statement 1).\n* Using modus tollens with \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB, we get \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB.\n* Since \u00acB is already known to be true, we can conclude that \u00acR must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The car was not red\" (\u00acR) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
