            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" (\u00acM)\n\t* \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" (V \u2192 M)\n\n2. From statement 1, we can infer that it is possible for the mummy to be asleep (\u00acM implies \u00ac\u00acM, which means M is not necessarily true).\n\n3. Statement 2 tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake (V \u2192 M). This is a conditional statement.\n\n4. We want to infer whether the vampire was awake or not. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of statement 2: \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV (if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake).\n\n5. Now we have two statements:\n\t* \u00acM (the mummy is not awake)\n\t* \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV (if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake)\n\n6. We can combine these two statements using modus ponens: \u00acM \u2227 (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV) \u22a2 \u00acV\n\n7. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
