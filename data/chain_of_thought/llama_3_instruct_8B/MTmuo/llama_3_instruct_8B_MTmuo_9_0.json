            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (\u00acM)\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (L \u2192 M')\n2. We want to infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acL).\n3. From statement 1, we know that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is not necessary (\u00acM). This does not provide any information about Lisa or her purchase.\n4. Statement 2 tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, this does not imply that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It only establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa's and Mark's purchases.\n5. Since we cannot conclude anything about Lisa's purchase from statement 1, and statement 2 only provides a conditional relationship, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
