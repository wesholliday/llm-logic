            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (\u00acLucyMustHaveGoneToTheZoo)\n\t* If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (JoeWentToPark \u2192 LucyMustHaveGoneToTheZoo)\n2. We want to infer whether Joe did not go to the park (\u00acJoeWentToPark).\n3. From the second statement, we can conclude that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n4. However, from the first statement, we know that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that LucyMustHaveGoneToTheZoo is false.\n5. Since \u00acLucyMustHaveGoneToTheZoo is true, we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acLucyWentToTheZoo).\n6. Now, let's consider the possibility that Joe went to the park. If he did, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo according to the second statement. But this contradicts our conclusion in step 4 that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that it is impossible for Joe to have gone to the park (\u00acJoeWentToPark).\n\nAnswer: yes",
