            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\" (\u00acWolf_in_den)\n\t* \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" (Bear_in_cave \u2192 Wolf_in_den)\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the bear is not in the cave, then the wolf does not need to be in the den. This is because the conditional statement only holds true when the antecedent (bear in the cave) is true.\n\n3. Now, let's combine this with the first statement: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\". This means that even if the bear was in the cave, it's still possible for the wolf to be somewhere else other than the den.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the bear is not in the cave based on these two statements alone. The presence or absence of the bear in the cave does not provide any information about the wolf's location.\n\nAnswer: no",
