We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\" (\u00acR)\n\t* \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\" (A \u2192 R)\n2. From these statements, we can infer that if the alien did visit Mars, then it is possible for the robot to have visited Jupiter (A \u2227 \u00acR).\n3. However, this does not provide any information about whether the alien actually visited Mars or not.\n4. We cannot conclude that \"The alien did not visit Mars\" because there might be other possibilities where the alien did visit Mars and the robot didn't visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
