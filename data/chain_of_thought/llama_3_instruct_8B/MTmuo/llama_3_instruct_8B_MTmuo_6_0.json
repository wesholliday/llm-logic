We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (\u00acB)\n\t* If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (S \u2192 B)\n2. We want to infer whether Sue did not choose pizza (\u223cS).\n3. From statement 1, we know that it's not necessary for Bob to have chosen pasta. This means that there might be a scenario where Bob didn't choose pasta.\n4. Statement 2 says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This implies that if Sue didn't choose pizza, Bob could still have chosen pasta (or not).\n5. Since we don't know what Bob actually chose, we can't conclude that Sue did or didn't choose pizza based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
