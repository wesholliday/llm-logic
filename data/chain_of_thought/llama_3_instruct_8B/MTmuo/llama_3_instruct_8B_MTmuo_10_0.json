            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside\" (\u00acC)\n\t* \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\" (\u2200x(D \u2192 C))\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that it is possible for the cat to be inside:\n\t* \u00acC \u2192 \u2203x(C) (by contraposition)\n\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \u2200x(D \u2192 C). This is a conditional statement, and we can rewrite it as:\n\t* D \u2192 C\n\n4. Using modus ponens on the rewritten statement, if we know that the dog was inside (D), then we can conclude that the cat must have been outside (C):\n\t* D \u2227 (D \u2192 C) \u2192 C\n\n5. Now, let's combine the two inferences:\n\t* \u00acC \u2192 \u2203x(C)\n\t* D \u2227 (D \u2192 C) \u2192 C\n\n6. We are asked to infer whether the dog was not inside (\u00acD). To do this, we can use modus tollens on the second statement:\n\t* \u00ac(D \u2227 (D \u2192 C)) \u2192 \u00acC\n\t* \u00ac(D \u2227 (D \u2192 C)) \u2192 \u2203x(C) (by contraposition)\n\n7. Combining the two inferences again:\n\t* \u00acC \u2192 \u2203x(C)\n\t* \u00ac(D \u2227 (D \u2192 C)) \u2192 \u2203x(C)\n\n8. Now, we can see that if the dog was not inside (\u00acD), then the first statement would be true (\u2203x(C)):\n\t* \u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\n\n9. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside:\n\t* Answer: yes",
