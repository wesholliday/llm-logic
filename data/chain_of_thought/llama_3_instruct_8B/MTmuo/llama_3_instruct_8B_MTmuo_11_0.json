We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" (\u00acM)\n\t* \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" (C \u2192 M)\n\n2. From statement 1, we can infer that it is possible for the muffins to be something other than blueberry (\u2203x \u00acM).\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility of the cake being chocolate (C). If C were true, then from statement 2, we would know that M must be true (C \u2192 M). But this contradicts our inference in step 2 (\u2203x \u00acM), since it implies that M is not possible.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that C cannot be true. In other words, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
