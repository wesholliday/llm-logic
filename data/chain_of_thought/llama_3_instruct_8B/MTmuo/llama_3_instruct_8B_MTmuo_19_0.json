We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (\u00acJenMustWatchBasketball)\n\t* If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (TomWatchFootball \u2192 JenMustWatchBasketball)\n2. We want to infer whether Tom did or did not watch football.\n3. From the second statement, we can conclude that if Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football.\n4. The first statement tells us that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that Jen did not necessarily watch basketball (JenDidNotWatchBasketball).\n5. However, this statement does not provide any direct information about Tom or his actions.\n\nSince we cannot conclude anything about Tom's action of watching football based on these statements alone, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
