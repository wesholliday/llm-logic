            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" (\u00acT)\n\t* \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" (P \u2192 T)\n\n2. From statement 1, we can infer that it is possible for the truck to be non-metallic (\u00acT).\n\n3. Statement 2 tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This implies that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck might not be metal either.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the possibility that the doll is plastic. If it were true, statement 2 would imply that the truck must be metal (P \u2192 T). But we know from statement 1 that this is not the case (\u00acT).\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the doll cannot be plastic, because if it were, then the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts statement 1.\n\n6. Hence, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
