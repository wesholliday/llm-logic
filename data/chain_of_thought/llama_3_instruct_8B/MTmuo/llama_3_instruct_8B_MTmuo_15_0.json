We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" (\u00acE)\n\t* \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" (S \u2192 E)\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane (\u00acS), then Erin does not need to have taken a train (\u223cE).\n3. Combining this with the first statement, we get: \u00acE \u2227 \u223cE\n4. This implies that Erin did not take a train.\n5. Now, let's consider the possibility that Sam took a plane (S). From statement 2, we know that if S, then E. But we already established that \u00acE. This means that S cannot be true, since it would lead to a contradiction.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
