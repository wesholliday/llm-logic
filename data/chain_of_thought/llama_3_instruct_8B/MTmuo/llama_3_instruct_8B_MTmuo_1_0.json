            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (\u00acSue)\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (\u2200x(Mary \u2192 Sue))\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be read as \"If Mary is true, then Sue is also true\". This means that if Mary is true, Sue must also be true.\n\n3. We want to infer whether Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acMary). To do this, we need to use the first statement and the second statement together.\n\n4. Since it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (\u00acSue), we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This doesn't give us any information about Mary being at the wedding or not.\n\n5. The second statement (\u2200x(Mary \u2192 Sue)) only tells us what happens if Mary is true, but it doesn't tell us whether Mary is actually true or not.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acMary) from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
