We have two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" (\u00acM)\n\t* \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" (JM \u2192 M)\n2. We want to infer whether the book was written by James or not.\n3. From statement 1, we know that it's not necessary for the book to be a mystery novel. This means that there might be other possibilities for the book's genre.\n4. Statement 2 tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, this doesn't give us any information about whether the book was actually written by James or not.\n5. We can't conclude that the book was not written by James just because it's not necessary for the book to be a mystery novel. There might still be other possibilities where the book is written by James but isn't a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The book was not written by James\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
