            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" (\u00acP)\n\t* \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" (S \u2192 P)\n\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants do not have to be denim: \u00acS \u2192 \u00acP\n\n3. Now, let's combine statements 1 and 2 using logical operators:\n\t* \u00acP (from statement 1)\n\t* \u00acS \u2192 \u00acP (from statement 2)\n\n4. Using modus tollens, we can infer that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim: S \u2192 P\n\n5. Combining statements 3 and 4, we get:\n\t* \u00acP\n\t* \u00acS \u2192 \u00acP\n\t* S \u2192 P\n\n6. Now, let's try to infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (\u00acS) from these statements.\n\n7. If we assume \u00acS is true, then the first statement becomes a tautology: \u00acP is already given as true.\n\n8. The second statement remains unchanged: \u00acS \u2192 \u00acP\n\n9. Combining the two, we get:\n\t* \u00acP\n\t* \u00acS \u2192 \u00acP\n\n10. This is consistent with our original statements, so we can conclude that \"The shirt was not cotton\" (\u00acS) is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
