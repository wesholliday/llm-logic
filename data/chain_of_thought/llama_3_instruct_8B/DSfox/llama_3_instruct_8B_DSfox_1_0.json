This means that there are two possibilities:\n\n* The flugel is zargled\n* The flugel is blimmed\n\nSince we know from statement (1) that the flugel is not zargled, we can eliminate this possibility.\n\nThis leaves us with only one option: the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
