Since we already know from statement (1) that the sneg is not sproted, this means that the first option (\"the sneg is sproted\") is false.\n\nNow, since the disjunction is exhaustive (either one of the two options must be true), and we've ruled out the first option, it follows logically that the second option (\"it is crampled\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
