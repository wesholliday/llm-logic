We know that the sprocket is not daggled (from statement 1), and either it is daggled or cranked (from statement 2). However, we don't have any information about whether the sprocket is actually cranked.\n\nSince we can't conclude for certain that the sprocket is cranked, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
