From statement 2, we know that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the consequence (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n\n4. However, we know from statement 2 that the sprocket is not daggled. This means that the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" cannot be true, because if it were true, the consequence \"the sprocket was daggled\" would also have to be true, but we know that's not the case.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
