From statement 2, we know that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement 1: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the consequence (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know from statement 2 that the zinger is not smoogled, and this conclusion follows from the condition \"the zinger was fraggled\", it means that the condition \"the zinger was fraggled\" cannot be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
