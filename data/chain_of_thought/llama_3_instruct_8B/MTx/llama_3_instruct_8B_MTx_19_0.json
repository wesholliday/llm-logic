From the first statement, we can conclude that if the smonk was vreebled, it must be true that the smonk plagged.\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the smonk did not plagged.\n4. Since the smonk did not plagged, and the only way for the smonk to not plagged is if it wasn't vreebled (according to the first statement), we can conclude that:\n\t* The smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
