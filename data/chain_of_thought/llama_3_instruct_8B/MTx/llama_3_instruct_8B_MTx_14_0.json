From the first statement, we can infer that if the clug was fleeked, it must have snugged (since \"if\" implies a necessary condition).\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the clug did not snugged.\n4. Since the clug did not snugged, and it would have snugged if it were fleeked, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
