From statement 2, we know that the dreb was not spened.\n3. Now, let's analyze statement 1: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the dreb being vroombed) is true, then the consequent (the dreb being spened) must also be true.\n4. Since we know from statement 2 that the dreb was not spened, and the consequent of statement 1 implies that the dreb would be spened if it were vroombed, we can conclude that the antecedent (the dreb being vroombed) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
