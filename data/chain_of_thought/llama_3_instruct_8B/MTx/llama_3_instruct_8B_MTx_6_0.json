We have two statements:\n\t* If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\t* The grommet did not plop the frink.\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the grommet was sploffed, it must have plopped the frink (by definition of \"sploffed\").\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n4. Since the grommet cannot both plop and not plop the frink at the same time, we can conclude that the first statement's condition (\"the grommet was sploffed\") is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
