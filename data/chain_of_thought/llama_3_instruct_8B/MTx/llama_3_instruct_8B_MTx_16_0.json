However, we know that statement 2 is true, which means that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nThis creates a contradiction with statement 1, since if the sneg was crampled, it must have sproted the frink according to the conditional statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent \"the sneg was crampled\" is actually false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
