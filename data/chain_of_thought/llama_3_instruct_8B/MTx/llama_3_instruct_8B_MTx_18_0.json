From statement 1, we can infer that if the shank is plooked, it must be nugged (since \"if\" implies a necessary condition).\n3. However, from statement 2, we know that the shank is not nugged.\n4. Since the shank cannot be both nugged and not nugged at the same time, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
