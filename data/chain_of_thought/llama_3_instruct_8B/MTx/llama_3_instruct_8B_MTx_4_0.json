From statement 2, we know that the fribble did not crink.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement 1: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequent (the fribble crinked) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know from statement 2 that the fribble did not crink, and the only way for this to happen is if the fribble was not snurgled (according to statement 1), we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
