From statement 2, we know that the whiffle did not tink.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement 1: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which means it implies a relationship between two events (shanking and tinking). If the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know that the whiffle did not tink (from statement 2), we can conclude that the antecedent \"the whiffle was shanked\" cannot be true. If it were true, the consequent \"the whiffle tinked\" would also have to be true, but since it's not, the condition must be false.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
