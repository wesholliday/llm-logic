From statement 2, we know that the splat did not quank.\n3. Since the splat did not quank, it means that the condition \"the splat quanked\" is false.\n4. Now, let's look at statement 1: If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked. This is an if-then statement, which implies a conditional relationship between being morphed and quanking.\n5. Since the condition \"the splat quanked\" is false (from step 3), it means that the antecedent \"the splat was morphed\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
