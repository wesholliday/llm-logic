The wug was not garpled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the wug is sproinged, it must be garpled. This implies that being sproinged is a sufficient condition for being garpled.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the wug is not garpled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the wug was sproinged or not. Since the wug is not garpled (from statement 2), and being sproinged implies being garpled (from statement 1), it follows that if the wug were sproinged, it would be garpled, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the wug cannot be both sproinged and not garpled. Since the wug is not garpled, it must not be sproinged either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
