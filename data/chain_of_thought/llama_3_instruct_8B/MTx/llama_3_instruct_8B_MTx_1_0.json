The flugel was not zargled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the flugel is blimmed, it must be zargled. This implies a conditional relationship between being blimmed and being zargled.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the flugel was blimmed or not. We can do this by using the contrapositive of statement (1):\n\nIf the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nWe already know that the flugel is not zargled (from statement 2). Therefore, we can conclude that if the flugel is not blimmed, it must be true. This means that the flugel being not blimmed implies the flugel being not zargled, which is already known.\n\nAnswer: yes",
