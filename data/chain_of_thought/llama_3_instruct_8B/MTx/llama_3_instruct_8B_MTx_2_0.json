From the second statement, we can conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint (this is a direct statement).\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. This is an if-then statement, which means that if the antecedent (the wug was flooped) is true, then the consequent (the wug bimmed the zoint) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know from the second statement that the wug did not bim the zoint, and this is the consequent of the first statement, it means that the antecedent (the wug was flooped) cannot be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
