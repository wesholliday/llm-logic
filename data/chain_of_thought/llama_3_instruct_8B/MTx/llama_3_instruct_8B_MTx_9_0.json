The twonk was not varnished.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can infer that if the twonk is plinked, it must be varnished. This implies a causal relationship between being plinked and being varnished.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the twonk is not varnished.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the twonk was plinked or not. If the twonk was plinked, it would be varnished according to statement (1). But since the twonk is not varnished (statement (2)), we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
