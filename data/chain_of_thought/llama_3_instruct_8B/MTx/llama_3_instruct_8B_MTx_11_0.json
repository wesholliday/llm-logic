From the first statement, we can conclude that if the flug is blummed, it must also be zimmed (since \"if\" implies a necessary condition).\n3. However, the second statement tells us that the flug is NOT zimmed.\n4. Since the flug cannot be both blummed and not zimmed at the same time (from step 2), we can conclude that the flug is NOT blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
