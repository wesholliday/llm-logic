This implies that being in the garage is a sufficient condition for the car's safety.\n\nHowever, the conclusion adds an additional condition: the garage must not be flooding. But this new condition is not mentioned in the original premise. The premise does not rule out the possibility of the garage being flooded; it only states that if the car is in the garage, it is safe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude from the premise alone that the car would still be safe even if the garage is flooding. The conclusion introduces a new condition that is not supported by the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
