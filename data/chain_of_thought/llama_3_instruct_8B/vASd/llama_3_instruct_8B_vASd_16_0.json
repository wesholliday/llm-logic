However, this new condition is not relevant to the original relationship between fertilizing the lawn and its resulting state (lush and green).\n\nIn other words, the premise only talks about the effect of fertilizing on the lawn's appearance, regardless of external factors like weather conditions. The conclusion tries to modify this relationship by introducing a new factor (drought) that is not accounted for in the original premise.\n\nThis argument is an example of a fallacy called \"undistributed middle term\" or \"false addition.\" It adds unnecessary information to the conclusion, making it invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
