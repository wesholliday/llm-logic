The premise doesn't mention anything about the battery being dead or not.\n\nTo be logically valid, the argument would need to follow a pattern of:\n\nAll A are B\nX is A\n\u2234 X is B\n\nBut this argument doesn't fit that pattern. Instead, it's trying to make a claim about a specific situation (charging with a dead battery) based on a general statement (charging in general).\n\nAnswer: no",
