However, the original premise only talks about getting enough sleep, not doing any specific activity like hard labor.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In this case, it's unclear how \"doing hard labor\" affects the relationship between getting enough sleep and being tired. The premise doesn't provide any information about how hard labor might impact fatigue.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the argument is not logically valid because the additional condition (\"do hard labor\") is not justified by the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
