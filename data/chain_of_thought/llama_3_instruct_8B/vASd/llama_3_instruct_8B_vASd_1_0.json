However, this new condition does not affect the relationship between \"the match being struck\" and \"the match lighting\". The original premise only talks about the effect of striking the match, regardless of its previous state (e.g., whether it was soaked in water or not).\n\nIn other words, the conclusion is trying to draw a conclusion based on an additional condition that is not relevant to the original premise. This means that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
