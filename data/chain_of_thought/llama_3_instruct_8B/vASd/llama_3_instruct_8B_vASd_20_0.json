However, there is an important assumption being made in the conclusion that is not explicitly stated in the premise: \"the medication has not expired\".\n\nIf we assume that the premise only applies when the medication is fresh and unexpired, then the conclusion would be invalid because it's trying to apply the premise to a situation where the condition (taking expired medication) is not specified.\n\nOn the other hand, if we interpret the premise as applying universally to any type of medication, regardless of its expiration date, then the conclusion would be valid.\n\nHowever, without further information or clarification on what \"I take medication\" means in this context, it's difficult to determine whether the argument is logically valid. Therefore, I'll provide a nuanced answer:\n\nAnswer: no",
