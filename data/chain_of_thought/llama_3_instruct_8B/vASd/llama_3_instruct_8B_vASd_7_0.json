To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nFrom the premise, we know that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition: the pilot light being out. This new information doesn't change the relationship between \"the oven is on\" and \"the kitchen is warm\", as stated in the premise.\n\nIn other words, even if the pilot light is out, if the oven is still on, the kitchen will still be warm (according to the premise). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
