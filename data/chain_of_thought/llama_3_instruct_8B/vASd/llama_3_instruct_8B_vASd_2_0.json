However, the premise only talks about going to the concert in general, not specifically considering the possibility of a bomb going off.\n\nThe issue here is that the premise doesn't provide any information about what would happen if a bomb goes off at the concert. It's possible that having a good time and a bomb going off are mutually exclusive events, or maybe there's some other factor at play.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time based solely on the premise. The conclusion is trying to extend the scope of the premise beyond what it can reasonably support.\n\nAnswer: no",
