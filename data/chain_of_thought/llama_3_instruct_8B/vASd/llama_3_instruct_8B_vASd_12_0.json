However, this new condition is not relevant to the original relationship between finishing homework and playing video games.\n\nIn other words, even if my computer catches on fire, it doesn't change the fact that I can play video games after finishing my homework (according to the original premise). The conclusion is trying to introduce a new factor that has no bearing on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. Answer: no",
