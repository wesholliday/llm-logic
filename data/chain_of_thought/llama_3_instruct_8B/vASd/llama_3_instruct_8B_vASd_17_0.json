However, this new condition is not supported by the original premise.\n\nThe original premise only talks about changing the oil, which might be sufficient for the car to run smoothly. But the conclusion introduces a new factor (transmission being shot) that could potentially affect the car's performance. The connection between these two conditions is unclear.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because it adds an extraneous condition without providing any logical link or justification.\n\nAnswer: no",
