The conclusion is \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\"\n\nThe issue with this argument is that it adds a new condition (\"turned in late\") to the original premise, which wasn't present initially. The original premise only mentioned \"well-written\" as a condition for getting an A.\n\nTo be logically valid, the conclusion should follow directly from the premise without introducing new information. In this case, the addition of \"turned in late\" is not justified by the original premise.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this argument is:\n\nAnswer: no",
