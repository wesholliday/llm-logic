However, this new condition is not relevant to the original relationship between filling up the gas tank and the car running. The original premise only mentions filling up the gas tank, but the conclusion introduces a new factor (the hole) that affects the outcome.\n\nIn other words, the conclusion is trying to extend the scope of the original premise by adding an additional condition, which is not justified by the evidence provided in the premise. This is an example of a fallacy called \"undistributed middle term\" or \"false addition\".\n\nAnswer: no",
