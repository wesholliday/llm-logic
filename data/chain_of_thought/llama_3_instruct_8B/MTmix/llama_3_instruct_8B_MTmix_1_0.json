The first statement only talks about the relationship between being blimmed and being zargled, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it's possible for the flugel not to have been zargled, but this doesn't help us conclude anything about whether the flugel was or wasn't blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was not blimmed based on these two statements. We don't have enough information to make a conclusion about the flugel's state of being blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
