But this doesn't give us any information about whether the fleeg was actually bluttered or not.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it might not have been surned, which means there's a possibility it didn't happen. However, this still doesn't provide any direct evidence about the fleeg being bluttered or not.\n\nSince we don't have any information that directly contradicts the possibility of the fleeg being bluttered, we can't conclude that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: no",
