We are given two statements:\n\t* If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged (conditional statement)\n\t* The clug might not have been snugged (contradictory statement)\n2. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the clug is fleeked, it must be snugged.\n3. However, the second statement says that the clug might not have been snugged, which contradicts the conclusion from step 2.\n4. Since the second statement provides a contradictory information, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: no",
