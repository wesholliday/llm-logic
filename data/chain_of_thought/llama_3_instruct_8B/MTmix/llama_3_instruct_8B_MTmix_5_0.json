The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\" implies that being fraggled is a sufficient condition for being smoogled.\n2. The statement \"The zinger might not have been smoogled\" implies that there is a possibility that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about whether the zinger was fraggled:\n\n* If the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled (from statement 1).\n* But we know that the zinger might not have been smoogled (from statement 2).\n* Therefore, it is possible that the zinger was not smoogled.\n* Since being fraggled implies being smoogled, and there is a possibility that the zinger was not smoogled, it follows that there is also a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
