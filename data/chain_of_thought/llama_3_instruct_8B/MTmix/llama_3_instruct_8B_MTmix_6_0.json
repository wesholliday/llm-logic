The statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\" implies that if the grommet was sploffed, it is necessary for the grommet to have plopped the frink.\n2. The statement \"The grommet might not have plopped the frink\" suggests that there is a possibility that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the grommet was sploffed:\n\n* If the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink (from statement 1).\n* But we know that the grommet might not have plopped the frink (from statement 2).\n* This means that the possibility of the grommet being sploffed and plooping the frink is contradicted by the fact that it might not have plopped the frink.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
