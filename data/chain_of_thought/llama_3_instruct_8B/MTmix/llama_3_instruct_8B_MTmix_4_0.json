The statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" implies that being snurgled is a sufficient condition for something to be crinked.\n2. The statement \"The fribble might not have crinked\" implies that it's possible that the fribble did not crink.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the fribble was snurgled:\n\n* If the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked (from step 1).\n* But we know that the fribble might not have crinked (from step 2).\n* This means that the fribble cannot be both snurgled and not crinked at the same time.\n* Therefore, if the fribble was not crinked, it must not have been snurgled.\n\nSo, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" because if it were snurgled, it would have to be crinked, but since it might not have crinked, it's more likely that it wasn't snurgled in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes",
