The second statement \"The splat might not have quanked\" introduces uncertainty about whether the splat actually quanked or not.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these statements:\n\nIf we assume that the splat was indeed morphed (based on the first statement), then it must have quanked according to the conditional relationship. However, the second statement tells us that the splat might not have quanked, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that the original assumption (\"The splat was morphed\") is unlikely to be true. Therefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
