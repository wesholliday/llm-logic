It might not have been garpled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the wug was sproinged, then it is possible to infer that it was garpled. However, from statement (2), we know that it's also possible that the wug wasn't garpled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something about the wug being sproinged. We can use a process of elimination:\n\n* If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled (from statement 1).\n* But it might not have been garpled (from statement 2).\n\nThis means that we cannot conclude for certain whether the wug was sproinged or not. The possibility remains open.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The wug was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: no",
