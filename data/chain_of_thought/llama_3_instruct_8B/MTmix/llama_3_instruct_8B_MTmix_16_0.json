However, we also know that it might not have sproted the frink (from statement 2).\n\nThis creates a contradiction: if the sneg was crampled, then it would have to have sproted the frink, but it might not have. This means that the assumption \"The sneg was crampled\" is unlikely to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
