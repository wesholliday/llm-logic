But statement 2 tells us that the glip might not have tragged. This means that there is a possibility that the glip did not trag even though it was slogged (if it was indeed slogged).\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the glip was not slogged. It's possible that the glip was slogged and still didn't trag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The glip was not slogged\" based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
