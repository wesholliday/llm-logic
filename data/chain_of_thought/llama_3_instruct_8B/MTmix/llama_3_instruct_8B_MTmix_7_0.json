The second statement \"The whiffle might not have tinked\" introduces uncertainty about whether the whiffle actually tinked.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these statements:\n\nIf we assume that the whiffle was indeed shanked (based on the first statement), then it must have tinked according to the conditional statement. However, the second statement suggests that this might not be the case, introducing doubt about whether the whiffle actually tinked.\n\nFrom here, we can't directly conclude that the whiffle was not shanked because the uncertainty about tinking doesn't necessarily imply a lack of shanking. The whiffle could have been shanked and still tinked (although this is uncertain).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The whiffle was not shanked\" based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
