If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park.\n\n2. Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe's actions.\n\nWe cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on these statements alone. The first statement only provides a conditional relationship between Joe and Lucy's actions, and the second statement only mentions a possibility for Lucy's action. There is no direct evidence or logical connection that would allow us to conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
