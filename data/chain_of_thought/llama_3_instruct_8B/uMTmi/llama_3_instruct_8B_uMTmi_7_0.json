If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris's finishing the race. It doesn't provide any direct information about whether Alex actually finished the race.\n\n2. Chris might not have finished the race.\nThis statement adds uncertainty to Chris's situation but still doesn't provide any conclusive evidence about Alex's finish.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information that directly relates to Alex's finish, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
