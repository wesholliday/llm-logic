            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" implies a conditional relationship between the shirt material and the pants material.\n2. This means that if the shirt is indeed cotton, we can conclude with certainty that the pants are denim.\n3. However, the second part of the statement \"the pants might not have been denim\" introduces uncertainty about the pants material.\n4. Since there's no direct connection between the shirt material and the pants material being non-denim, we cannot infer anything about the shirt material based on this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
