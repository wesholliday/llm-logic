The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the alien did visit Mars, it implies that the robot also visited Jupiter. However, this does not provide any information about whether the alien actually visited Mars or not.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the robot might not have visited Jupiter, which means there is a possibility that the robot didn't go to Jupiter. This doesn't affect our conclusion about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nSince we don't have any direct evidence or logical connection between the robot's visit to Jupiter and the alien's visit to Mars, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
