The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the author and the genre of the book.\n2. However, the second part of the statement \"Also, the book might not be a mystery novel\" introduces uncertainty about the genre of the book.\n3. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty whether the book is a mystery novel or not.\n\nNow, let's examine the possibility of inferring that the book was not written by James:\n\n1. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between the author and the genre, but it does not provide any direct evidence about the authorship.\n2. We cannot conclude that the book was not written by James based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
