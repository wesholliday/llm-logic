However, the statement also says \"Erin might not have taken a train\", which means there is no guarantee that Erin took a train even if Sam took a plane.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot conclude that Sam did not take a plane. The possibility remains that Sam took a plane and Erin didn't take a train (or maybe she did). We just don't know for sure what Erin's mode of transportation was.\n\nAnswer: no",
