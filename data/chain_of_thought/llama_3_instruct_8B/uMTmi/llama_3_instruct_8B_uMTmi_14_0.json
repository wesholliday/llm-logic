If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis statement implies a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. It does not provide any information about the bear's presence or absence in the cave.\n\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den.\nThis statement is a possibility, but it doesn't provide any direct evidence about the bear's presence or absence in the cave.\n\nSince we don't have any direct evidence about the bear being in the cave, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on these statements. The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusion about the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
