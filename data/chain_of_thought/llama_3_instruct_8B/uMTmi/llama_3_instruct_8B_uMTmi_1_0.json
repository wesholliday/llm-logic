If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding. It does not provide any direct information about Mary's attendance.\n\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\nThis statement is an assertion of possibility, but it doesn't provide any concrete evidence about Sue's actual attendance.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence only provides information about their joint attendance, not about Mary's individual attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
