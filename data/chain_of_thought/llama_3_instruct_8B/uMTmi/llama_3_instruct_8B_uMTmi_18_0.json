            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the properties of the doll and the truck.\n2. This means that if the doll is indeed plastic, then we can conclude that the truck is metal.\n3. However, the statement also mentions that \"the truck might not have been metal\", which suggests that there's no guarantee about the truck's material.\n4. Since we don't know for certain whether the truck is metal or not, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the doll's material based solely on this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The possibility remains open that the doll could be plastic, and we would need additional information to determine its actual material.\n\nAnswer: no",
