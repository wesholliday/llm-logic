The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" implies a conditional relationship between the cake and muffins.\n2. This means that if the cake is indeed chocolate, then the muffins are guaranteed to be blueberry.\n3. However, the second part of the statement \"the muffins might not have been blueberry\" introduces uncertainty about the muffins' flavor.\n4. Since we don't know for certain whether the muffins were blueberry or not, we can't conclude that the cake was chocolate based on this information alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate from the given statements. The possibility remains that the cake could be something other than chocolate, and the muffins might still be blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
