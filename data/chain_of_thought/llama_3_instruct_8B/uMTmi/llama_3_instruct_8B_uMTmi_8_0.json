The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" implies a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n2. This means that if the vampire is awake, we can conclude with certainty that the mummy is also awake.\n3. However, the converse is not necessarily true: just because the mummy might not be awake, it doesn't mean the vampire wasn't awake.\n\nWe cannot infer that the vampire was not awake solely based on the fact that the mummy might not have been awake. There's no direct connection between their states of wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no",
