The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n2. This means that if Sue did choose pizza, we can conclude with certainty that Bob chose pasta.\n3. However, the statement also says \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\", which introduces uncertainty about Bob's choice.\n4. Since we don't know for sure whether Bob chose pasta or not, we cannot infer anything about Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sue did not choose pizza based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
