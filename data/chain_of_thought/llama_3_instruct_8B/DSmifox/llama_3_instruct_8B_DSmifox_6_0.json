This implies that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed (since one of these two options has to be true).\n\nNow, let's combine this information with the first statement:\n\n1. \"The grommet might not be plopped\" \nThis means there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped.\n\n2. \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\"\nIf the grommet is not plopped, then according to this statement, it must be sploffed (since one of these two options has to be true).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the grommet might not be plopped, then it is indeed sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
