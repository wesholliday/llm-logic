This means that if the whiffle is not tinked (as stated in statement 1), then it must be shanked.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\n* If the whiffle might not be tinked (statement 1), then it must be shanked (since it cannot be both not tinked and tinked at the same time).\n* Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is indeed shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
