This means that if the sneg is not sproted (as stated in statement 1), then it must be crampled.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\n* The sneg might not be sproted (given)\n* If the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled (from statement 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
