This means that if the splat is not quanked (as stated in 1), then it must be morphed.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\n* The splat might not be quanked (given statement)\n* If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed (from statement 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
