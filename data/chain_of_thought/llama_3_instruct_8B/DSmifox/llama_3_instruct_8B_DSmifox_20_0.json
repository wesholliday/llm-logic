This means that if the fleeg is not surned (as stated in statement 1), then it must be bluttered.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\n* The fleeg might not be surned (given)\n* If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered (from statement 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
