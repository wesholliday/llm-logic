If the doll is plastic, it doesn't necessarily mean that the truck is metal; it only provides a possible conclusion.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\nThis statement negates the possibility that the truck being metal is a necessary condition. However, it doesn't provide any information about the properties of the doll.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot infer anything conclusive about the material of the doll. The first statement only provides a possible relationship between the doll and the truck, while the second statement negates a specific conclusion about the truck. We don't have enough information to make an inference about the doll's material.\n\nAnswer: no",
