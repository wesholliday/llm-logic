But from statement 2, we don't know anything about the cat's location when the dog is outside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (from statement 1).\n* But it's not the case that the cat must have been outside (from statement 2).\n\nThis means we can't conclude anything about the cat's location when the dog is inside. We don't know if the cat was outside or not.\n\nHowever, we can infer something about the dog's location:\n\n* If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (from statement 1).\n* But it's not the case that the cat must have been outside (from statement 2).\n\nThis implies that the dog cannot be both inside and outside at the same time. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog is either inside or outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
