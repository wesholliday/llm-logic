However, it does not provide any information about the apple.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We don't know the color of the apple or the banana.\n* The first statement only provides a conditional relationship between the apple and banana colors.\n* The second statement negates the possibility of the banana being yellow, but this doesn't give us any direct information about the apple.\n\nSince we have no other information that directly relates to the apple's color, we cannot infer anything about the apple's color. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
