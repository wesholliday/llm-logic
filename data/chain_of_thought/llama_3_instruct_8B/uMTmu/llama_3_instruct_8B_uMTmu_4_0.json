It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the alien did visit Mars, it implies that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that it is not necessarily true that the robot visited Jupiter. This means that there might be a scenario where the robot didn't visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: If the alien did visit Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter (from statement 1). But since it's not necessarily true that the robot visited Jupiter (from statement 2), we can conclude that the alien might not have visited Mars. This is because if the alien didn't visit Mars, there would be no implication about the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
