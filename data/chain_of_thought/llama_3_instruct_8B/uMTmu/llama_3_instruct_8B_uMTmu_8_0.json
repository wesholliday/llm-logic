It implies that even if the vampire was awake, the mummy might still be asleep or in a different state.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer whether the vampire was awake or not. The first statement suggests a possible connection between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness, but the second statement introduces uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake based on this information.\n\nAnswer: no",
