It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if Tom watches football, Jen will watch basketball. However, this does not imply that Tom did or did not watch football.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that it is not necessarily true that Jen watched basketball. This means that Jen might have watched something else instead of basketball.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about Tom's actions, we cannot conclude whether Tom watched football or not. The statements only provide a conditional relationship between Tom and Jen's activities, but they do not give us enough information to make a definitive statement about Tom's behavior.\n\nAnswer: no",
