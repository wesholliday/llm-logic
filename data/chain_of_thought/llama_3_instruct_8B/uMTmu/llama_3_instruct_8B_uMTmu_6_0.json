If Sue chooses pizza, it is guaranteed that Bob will choose pasta.\n2. \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\nThis statement negates the previous implication. It means that there is no guarantee that Bob will choose pasta.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that Sue did not choose pizza. The first statement only provides a conditional relationship between Sue and Bob's choices, but it does not provide any information about Sue's actual choice. The second statement simply negates the previous implication, which doesn't affect our knowledge of Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
