It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark might not have bought the blue shirt either. This is because the conditional statement only establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities.\n\nHowever, from statement (2), we know that it's not necessarily true that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that there could be another possibility where Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can't infer with certainty whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. There might be other scenarios where Lisa didn't buy the red shirt but Mark still bought the blue shirt (or didn't buy it).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on this information.\n\nAnswer: no",
