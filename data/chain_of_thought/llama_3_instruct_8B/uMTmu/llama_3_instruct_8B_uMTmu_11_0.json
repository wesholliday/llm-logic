If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\nThis statement negates the possibility of the muffins being blueberry. However, it doesn't provide any information about the cake.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* The cake could be chocolate or something else.\n* We cannot infer anything about the cake based on the muffins not being blueberry.\n\nSince there's no direct connection between the muffins and cake, we cannot conclude that the cake was not chocolate. Therefore,\n\nAnswer: no",
