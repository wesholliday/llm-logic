It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if Joe didn't go to the park, Lucy might or might not have gone to the zoo. This is because the conditional statement only establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, but doesn't provide any information about what happens when Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that it's not necessarily true that Lucy went to the zoo. This means that Lucy might have gone to the zoo or she might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Joe did not go to the park?\n\nWe can't directly conclude that Joe didn't go to the park because statements (1) and (2) don't provide any information about what happens when Joe doesn't go to the park. We only know that Lucy might or might not have gone to the zoo, but we don't have any information about Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
