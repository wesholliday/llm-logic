If Alex finishes, it is necessary for Chris to finish as well.\n2. \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This statement negates the necessity of Chris finishing the race.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* Alex finishing the race does not guarantee Chris finishing the race (since Chris doesn't necessarily need to finish).\n* We cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race from the given information.\n\nHowever, we are asked if we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. Since there is no direct relationship between Alex's finishing and Chris's not finishing, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
