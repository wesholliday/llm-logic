If Mary is present, it's necessary for Sue to be present as well.\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This statement negates the necessity of Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n* The conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance is still valid: if Mary is present, it's necessary for Sue to be present.\n* However, the necessity of Sue's presence has been negated. This means that Sue might not have been at the wedding even if Mary was.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The statements only provide information about the relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance, but they don't give us any direct evidence about Mary's presence or absence.\n\nAnswer: no",
