It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the griffin is in the forest, it implies that the unicorn is also in the forest. However, this does not provide any information about the griffin's presence or absence outside of the forest.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that it's not possible for the unicorn to be in the forest. This means that the unicorn cannot be in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: if the griffin is not in the forest, then there's no implication about the unicorn's presence or absence. However, if the griffin is in the forest, it implies that the unicorn must also be in the forest (from statement 1). But we know that the unicorn cannot be in the forest (from statement 2).\n\nThis means that the only possible scenario is that the griffin is not in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would have to be there as well, which contradicts statement (2).\n\nAnswer: yes",
