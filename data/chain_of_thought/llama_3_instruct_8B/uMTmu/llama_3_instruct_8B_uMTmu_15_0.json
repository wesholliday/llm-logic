It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if Sam takes a plane, Erin will take a train. However, this does not imply that Erin did not take a train in other scenarios.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that it is not necessarily true that Erin took a train. This means that there might be other possibilities for Erin's mode of transportation besides taking a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train according to statement (1). But since it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (statement (2)), this means that there might be other scenarios where Sam did take a plane and Erin didn't take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sam did not take a plane. There are still possibilities where Sam took a plane and Erin took something else.\n\nAnswer: no",
