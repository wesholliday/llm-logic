We have two statements:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement)\n\t* The mummy was awake (fact)\n\n2. From the fact \"The mummy was awake\", we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement is true: the vampire was awake.\n\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply modus ponens to infer the conclusion:\n\t* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\n\t* The vampire was awake (from step 2)\n\t* Therefore, the mummy was awake\n\n4. However, this does not directly give us information about whether the vampire is awake or not. We only know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake.\n\n5. To infer \"The vampire was awake\" from the given statements, we need additional information. Since we don't have any other clues, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
