From statement (2), we can conclude that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n\n3. However, this conclusion does not provide any information about the cake's flavor. We only know something about the muffins, but not about the cake.\n\n4. Statement (1) is a conditional statement, which means it provides a relationship between two events: the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. But it doesn't say that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the cake was chocolate based solely on the information provided in statements (1) and (2).\n\nAnswer: no",
