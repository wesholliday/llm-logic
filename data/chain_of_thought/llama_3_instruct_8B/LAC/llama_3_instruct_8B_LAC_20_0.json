We have two statements:\n\t* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (conditional statement)\n\t* The banana was yellow (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow.\n3. Now, we're given a new fact: the banana is actually yellow.\n4. Since the banana being yellow matches the condition in the original conditional statement, we can conclude that the apple might have been red (but not necessarily).\n5. However, we cannot logically infer that the apple was definitely red.\n\nThe reason is that there could be other scenarios where the banana is yellow without the apple being red. For example, maybe the banana was always yellow, and the apple was never red in the first place.\n\nAnswer: no",
