We have two statements:\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (conditional statement)\n\t* The truck was blue (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue.\n3. Now, we're given a new fact: the truck is actually blue.\n4. Since the truck being blue matches the condition in the original conditional statement (\"if the car was red, then the truck was blue\"), we can conclude that the car might have been red.\n\nHowever, there's a crucial limitation here: we cannot logically infer that the car was definitely red. The conditional statement only provides a correlation between the car's color and the truck's color; it doesn't guarantee that the car is actually red.\n\nAnswer: no",
