The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that Amy did play tennis.\n4. Since Amy did play tennis, we can conclude that the condition in the first statement (Jeff playing basketball) might or might not be true.\n\nHowever, we cannot logically infer that Jeff played basketball because there is no direct evidence linking Jeff's actions to Amy's actions. The statements only provide a correlation between Jeff's and Amy's activities, but they do not establish a causal relationship.\n\nAnswer: no",
