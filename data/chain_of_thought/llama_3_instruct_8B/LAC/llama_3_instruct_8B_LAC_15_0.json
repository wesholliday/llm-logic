We have two statements:\n\t* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (conditional statement)\n\t* Erin took a train (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n3. Now, we know that Erin took a train (from the factual statement).\n4. Since Erin took a train, it means that the condition \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n5. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train is true.\n6. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nThe key point here is that there might be other possibilities where Erin took a train without Sam taking a plane. For example, maybe someone else took the plane and Erin took the train.\n\nAnswer: no",
