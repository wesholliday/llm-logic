We have two statements:\n\t* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement)\n\t* Sue was at the wedding (factual statement)\n2. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if Mary was indeed at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n3. Now, we have a new piece of information: Sue was actually at the wedding (factual statement).\n4. Since Sue being at the wedding is consistent with the condition \"Sue was at the wedding\" in the original conditional statement, we can conclude that Mary might also be at the wedding.\n\nHowever, there's a crucial difference between \"might be\" and \"is\". We cannot logically infer that Mary was definitely at the wedding. The original conditional statement only establishes a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence; it doesn't provide direct evidence for Mary's attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
