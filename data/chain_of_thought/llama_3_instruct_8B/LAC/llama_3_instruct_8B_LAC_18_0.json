From statement (2), we know that the truck is indeed metal.\n3. Now, let's look at statement (1). It says \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true.\n4. We don't have any information that confirms or denies the condition (the doll being plastic). All we know is that the truck is metal, but this doesn't necessarily mean the doll is plastic.\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
