This implies that there are possibilities where the alien didn't visit Mars.\n\nThe conclusion simply reiterates this idea by stating that the alien might not have visited Mars. Since the premise already establishes this possibility, the conclusion is logically following from the premise.\n\nIn other words, the argument is using the premise to draw a logical inference about the probability of the alien visiting Mars. The connection between the premise and the conclusion is one of logical entailment, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
