This means that there are possibilities where the notebook could be elsewhere.\n\nThe conclusion simply reiterates this idea by stating that the notebook might not be in the drawer. Since the premise already establishes this possibility, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
