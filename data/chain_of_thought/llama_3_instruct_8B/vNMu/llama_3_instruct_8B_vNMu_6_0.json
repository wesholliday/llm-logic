The premise is stating that it's not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza, which means that there are other possibilities besides her choosing pizza.\n\nThe argument seems to be logically valid because the premise provides evidence that supports the conclusion. If it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, then it's possible that she might not have chosen pizza. The conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
