The premise is negating the idea that the pen must be in the bag, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the pen can't be in the bag at all.\n\nIn other words, the premise only tells us that the pen's presence in the bag isn't guaranteed, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of the pen being in the bag. The conclusion is simply stating this possibility without adding any new information.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise (i.e., the premise provides a necessary condition for the conclusion), I would say that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
