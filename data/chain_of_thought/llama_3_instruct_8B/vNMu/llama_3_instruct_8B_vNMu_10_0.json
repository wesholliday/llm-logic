The premise is stating that it's not necessary for the dog to be inside, which implies that there are other possibilities as well.\n\nThe argument seems to be logically valid because it's using a negation of necessity to infer a possibility. In other words, if it's not necessary for the dog to be inside, then it's possible (or might) not be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
