The premise is stating that it's not necessarily true that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, can we be certain of the conclusion based solely on the premise?\n\nThe answer is yes, because the premise explicitly states that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be in her bag. This means that it's possible (or even likely) that they might not be in her bag. The conclusion logically follows from this premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
