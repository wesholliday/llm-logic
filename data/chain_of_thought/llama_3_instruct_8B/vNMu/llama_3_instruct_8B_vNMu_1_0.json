The premise is stating that it's not necessary for Mary to be at the wedding, which implies that she might not be there either.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a correct pattern of reasoning:\n\n1. The premise denies necessity (must have been), which leaves room for possibility.\n2. The conclusion draws a logical inference from the premise, stating that possibility exists (might not have been).\n\nAnswer: yes",
