The premise is stating that it's not necessary for Lisa to have bought the red shirt.\n\nThe argument seems to be logically valid because the premise provides evidence against the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt, and the conclusion follows naturally from this premise. If it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then it's possible that she might not have bought it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
