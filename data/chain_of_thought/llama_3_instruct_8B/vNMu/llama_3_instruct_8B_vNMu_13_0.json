The premise states that it's not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, and the conclusion restates this idea by saying that the toy might not be there.\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows a straightforward equivalence between the premise and the conclusion. The premise provides sufficient information to support the conclusion, and the conclusion does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
