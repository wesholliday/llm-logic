The premise is stating that it's not necessarily true that the griffin had to be in the forest.\n\nThe key point here is that \"it's not the case\" and \"might not have been\" are both expressing possibilities or uncertainties, rather than absolute negations. In other words, the premise is not saying that the griffin definitely wasn't in the forest, but rather that it's possible that it wasn't.\n\nGiven this understanding, the argument appears to be logically valid. The premise provides a reason for thinking that the conclusion might be true, and the conclusion follows naturally from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
