We know that the book is indeed a mystery novel (from statement 2), which means we can apply the implication from statement 1:\n\n\"The book was written by James \u2192 The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nSince the book is a mystery novel, it satisfies the condition on the right-hand side of the implication. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\n\"The book was written by James\" must be true\n\nAnswer: yes",
