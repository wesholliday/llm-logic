This implies a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that Amy did play tennis.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that Jeff played basketball. The original statement only establishes a conditional relationship, not a direct causal link. It's possible that Jeff didn't play basketball at all, but Amy still played tennis for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
