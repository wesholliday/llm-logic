            "content": "Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (conditional statement)\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" (factual statement)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's examine the conditional statement 1. It says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. This implies a causal relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nHowever, just because Sue is at the wedding (as stated in statement 2), it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary is also at the wedding. The conditional statement only provides a sufficient condition for Sue to be at the wedding, not a necessary one.\n\nIn other words, we can't conclude that Mary was at the wedding solely based on the fact that Sue was at the wedding. There might be other reasons why Sue attended the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
