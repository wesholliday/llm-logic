It says that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants will be denim. This implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. However, it does not imply that the shirt must be cotton for the pants to be denim.\n\nIn other words, there could be another condition or circumstance that makes the pants denim, unrelated to the shirt's material. For instance, maybe the pants were always denim, regardless of the shirt's material.\n\nSince we only know that the pants are denim (statement 2), we cannot conclude with certainty that the shirt is cotton. There might be other possibilities that satisfy the condition in statement 1 but do not involve a cotton shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
