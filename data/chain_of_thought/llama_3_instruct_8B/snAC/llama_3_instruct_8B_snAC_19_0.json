It does not necessarily mean that Tom actually watched football, but rather that if he did, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n\n2. \"Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n\nThis statement tells us that Jen indeed watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know that Jen watched basketball.\n* The conditional statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n* However, we don't know whether Tom actually watched football or not. The condition is not fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Tom watched football\" is true. There could be other scenarios where Tom did not watch football, but the conditional statement still holds true because Jen watched basketball regardless of what Tom did.\n\nAnswer: no",
