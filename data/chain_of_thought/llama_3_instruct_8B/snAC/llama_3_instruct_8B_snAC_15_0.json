If Sam takes a plane, it necessarily leads to Erin taking a train.\n\n2. \"Erin took a train\" is true.\nThis statement tells us that Erin indeed took a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, and we know that Erin took a train (from statement 2), it means that the condition in the conditional statement has been fulfilled. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nThere could be other scenarios where Erin takes a train without Sam taking a plane. For instance, maybe there's another person who took a plane and led to Erin taking a train.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
