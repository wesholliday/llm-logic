However, this does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is true.\n\nThere could be other scenarios where Lucy goes to the zoo without Joe going to the park. For instance, maybe someone else took Lucy to the zoo while Joe was busy elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Joe went to the park\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
