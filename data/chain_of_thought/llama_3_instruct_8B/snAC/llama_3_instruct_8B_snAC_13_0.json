If the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\n2. \"The truck was blue\" is true.\n\nThis statement confirms that the consequent in the original conditional statement is indeed true.\n\nNow, let's examine whether it necessarily follows that \"The car was red\" is true:\n\nSince we know that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, and we also know that \"The truck was blue\" is true, we can conclude that the antecedent (the car being red) must be true. This is because the conditional statement implies a necessary relationship between the two statements.\n\nTherefore, it necessarily follows that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
