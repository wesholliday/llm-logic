This implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n\nHowever, from statement (2) alone, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza. We only know that Bob chose pasta, but this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza.\n\nThe original conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not imply the converse \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\". The two statements are logically independent.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
