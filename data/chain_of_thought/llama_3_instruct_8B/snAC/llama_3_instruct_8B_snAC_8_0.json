It says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This implies a causal relationship between the two statements: if the vampire is awake, it necessarily leads to the mummy being awake.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the converse is true. Just because the mummy is awake, we cannot conclude that the vampire is awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake, unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
