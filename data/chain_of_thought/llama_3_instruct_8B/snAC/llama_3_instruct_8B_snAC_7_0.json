It only states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would also have finished the race. However, we don't know whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nSince we only know that Chris finished the race (statement 2), we cannot conclude that Alex necessarily finished the race. There might be other scenarios where Chris finished the race without Alex finishing it.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
