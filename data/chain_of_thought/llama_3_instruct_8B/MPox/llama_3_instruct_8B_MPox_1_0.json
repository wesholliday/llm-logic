The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The flugel was blimmed\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this situation: if the condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n5. Since the condition is true, we can conclude that the consequence is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
