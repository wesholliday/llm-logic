The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the consequence (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n3. We know that \"The sprocket was cranked\" is indeed true, since we're given this information as a premise.\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n5. Since we've established that the sprocket was indeed cranked, we can conclude that the consequence (the sprocket being daggled) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
