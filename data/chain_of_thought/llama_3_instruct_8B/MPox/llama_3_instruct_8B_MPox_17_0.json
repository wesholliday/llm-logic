The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flob being skizzled) is true, then the consequence (the flob movating) will also be true.\n3. We are given the information that \"The flob was skizzled\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation:\n\t* If the condition \"The flob was skizzled\" is true, then the consequence \"the flob movated\" must also be true.\n\nSo, based on the given information and the conditional statement, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
