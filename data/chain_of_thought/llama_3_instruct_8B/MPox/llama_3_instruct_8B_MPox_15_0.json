The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the dreb being vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb being spened) must also be true.\n3. Since we are given that \"The dreb was vroombed\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was spened\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
