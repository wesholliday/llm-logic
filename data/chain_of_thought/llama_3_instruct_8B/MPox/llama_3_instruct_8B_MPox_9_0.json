This means that if the antecedent (\"the twonk was plinked\") is true, then the consequent (\"it was varnished\") must also be true.\n3. The original statement \"The twonk was plinked\" provides evidence for the truth of the antecedent.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (\"it was varnished\") is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
