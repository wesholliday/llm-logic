The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smonk being vreebled) is true, then the conclusion (the smonk plagging) must also be true.\n3. We are given the first statement \"The smonk was vreebled\", which implies that the condition in the second statement is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that if the condition is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
