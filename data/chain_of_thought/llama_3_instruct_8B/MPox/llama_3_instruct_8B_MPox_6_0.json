We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n\t* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The grommet was sploffed\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If the condition (grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The grommet plopped the frink\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
