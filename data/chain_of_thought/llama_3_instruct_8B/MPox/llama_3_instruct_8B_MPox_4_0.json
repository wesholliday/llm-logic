The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinked) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this situation: if the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinked) must also be true.\n5. Since the condition is true, we can conclude that the consequence is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
