The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smip being shripped) is true, then the consequence (the smip luppung the zoint) must also be true.\n3. We can infer from the first statement that the condition \"the smip was shripped\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation: if the smip was shripped (which it was), then the smip lupped the zoint (by the second statement).\n5. This means that we can conclude that the consequence \"the smip lupped the zoint\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
