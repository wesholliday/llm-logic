The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flug being blummed) is true, then the conclusion (the flug being zimmed) must also be true.\n3. We are given that \"The flug was blummed\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this situation:\n\t* If the condition (the flug being blummed) is true, then the conclusion (the flug being zimmed) must also be true.\n5. Since the condition is true, we can conclude that the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
