The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the wug being flooped) is true, then the consequence (the wug bimming the zoint) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The wug was flooped\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug bimmed the zoint\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
