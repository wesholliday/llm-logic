The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the clug being fleeked) is true, then the consequence (the clug snugging) must also be true.\n3. Since we have evidence that the condition \"The clug was fleeked\" is indeed true (from the first statement), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence \"The clug snugged\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
