The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the conclusion (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The zinger was fraggled\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If the zinger was fraggled, then it must be true that the zinger was smoogled\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was smoogled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
