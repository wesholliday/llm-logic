The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the whiffle being shanked) is true, then the consequence (the whiffle tinking) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The whiffle was shanked\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that \"then the whiffle tinked\" must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle tinked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
