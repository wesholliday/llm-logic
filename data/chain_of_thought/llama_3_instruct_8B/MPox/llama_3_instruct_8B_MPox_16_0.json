The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sneg being crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know that \"The sneg was crampled\" is indeed true (from the first statement), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\n\t* If the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg sproted the frink\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
