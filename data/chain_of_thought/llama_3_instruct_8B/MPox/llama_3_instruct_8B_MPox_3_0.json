The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanking) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The splat was morphed\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If the splat was morphed, then it quanked\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the splat indeed quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
