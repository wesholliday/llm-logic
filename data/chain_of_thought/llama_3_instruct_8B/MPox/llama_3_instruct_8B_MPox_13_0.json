The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the glip being slogged) is true, then the conclusion (the glip being tragged) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The glip was slogged\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
