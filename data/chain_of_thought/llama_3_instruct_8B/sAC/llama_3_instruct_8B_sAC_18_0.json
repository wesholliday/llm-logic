It means that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement \"The truck was metal\" is an independent statement that asserts the truth of the truck being metal.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether it follows that \"The doll was plastic\" is true. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, we can only conclude that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, we don't have any information about the truth value of the antecedent.\n\nThe second statement \"The truck was metal\" tells us that the consequent is indeed true, but it doesn't provide any information about the antecedent. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic just because the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
