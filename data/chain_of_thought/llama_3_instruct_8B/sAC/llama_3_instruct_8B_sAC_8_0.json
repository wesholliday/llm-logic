It says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This implies that there is a direct correlation between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nSince we already know that the mummy is awake (from statement 2), it follows logically that the condition \"the vampire was awake\" must be true for the mummy to be awake, according to statement 1.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
