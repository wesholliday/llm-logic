This means that finishing the race is a sufficient condition for both Alex and Chris to finish.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"Chris finished the race\". Since this statement is true, it implies that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\nGiven that Chris finished the race (statement 2), we can conclude that Alex must have also finished the race. This is because finishing the race is a sufficient condition for both Alex and Chris to finish, as stated in the first conditional relationship.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, it follows that \"Alex finished the race\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
