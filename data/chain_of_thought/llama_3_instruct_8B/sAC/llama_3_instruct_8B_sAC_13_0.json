If the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\n2. \"The truck was blue\" is true.\n\nSince this statement is true, we can conclude that the consequent of the original conditional statement is indeed true.\n\nNow, let's examine whether it follows that \"The car was red\" is true:\n\nFrom the original conditional statement, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. Since we have established that the truck is indeed blue, this part of the conditional statement holds true.\n\nHowever, the converse does not necessarily hold: just because the truck is blue, it doesn't mean the car was red. There could be other scenarios where the truck is blue but the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
