It says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. This implies a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nSince we already know that the unicorn is in the forest (from statement 2), it doesn't necessarily mean that the griffin is also in the forest. The implication only tells us that if the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would be too. But we don't have any information about the griffin's location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
