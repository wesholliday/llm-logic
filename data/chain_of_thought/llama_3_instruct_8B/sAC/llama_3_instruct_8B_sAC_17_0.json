It does not directly state that Ben ate pasta.\n\n2. \"Kate ate salad\" is true.\nThis statement provides additional information about Kate's actions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (from step 1).\n* We also know that Kate did eat salad (from step 2).\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta. The original conditional statement only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad; it does not guarantee that Ben actually ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
