Since we know the banana is yellow, this implies that the antecedent might be true. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that the apple is indeed red.\n\nThere could be other possibilities where the banana is yellow without the apple being red. For instance, \"If the apple was green, then the banana was yellow\" would also satisfy both conditions.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow necessarily that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
