However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt is indeed cotton.\n\nTo determine if the shirt is cotton, we need more information or additional statements. The given information only tells us about the relationship between the shirt and pants, but it doesn't provide direct evidence about the material of the shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
