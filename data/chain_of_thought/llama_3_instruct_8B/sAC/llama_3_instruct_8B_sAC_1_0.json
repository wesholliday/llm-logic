This implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nNow, let's consider statement (2): \"Sue was at the wedding\". Since this is true, it means that Sue did indeed attend the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too. And since we already know that Sue was at the wedding, it logically follows that:\n\nMary must have also been at the wedding\n\nAnswer: yes",
