However, we only know that Lucy did go to the zoo (step 2). We don't have any information about whether Joe actually went to the park.\n\nIn other words, just because Lucy went to the zoo, we can't conclude that Joe went to the park. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Joe went to the park, but it doesn't provide evidence for or against Joe's actual actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
