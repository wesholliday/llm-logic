This implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know that Bob chose pasta (statement 2).\n* From statement (1), we can conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n* Since Bob actually chose pasta (statement 2), it means that Sue must have chosen something else other than pizza.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true. The truth of the statements only implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it doesn't provide enough information to conclude what Sue actually chose.\n\nAnswer: no",
