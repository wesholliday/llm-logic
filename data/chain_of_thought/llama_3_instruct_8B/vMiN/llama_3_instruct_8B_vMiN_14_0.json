This is consistent with the premise, which also states that the milk might not be on the counter.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a correct pattern of reasoning. The premise provides evidence for the conclusion, and the conclusion logically follows from the premise. There is no logical contradiction or flaw in the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
