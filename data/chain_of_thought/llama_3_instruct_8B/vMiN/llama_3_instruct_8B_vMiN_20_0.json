This is consistent with the premise, which also states that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nThe argument is using the concept of possibility to arrive at its conclusion. The premise is introducing a possibility (the sunglasses might not be in her bag), and the conclusion is drawing a logical consequence from that possibility (it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag).\n\nThis type of argument is logically valid because it follows a correct pattern of reasoning. It's using the concept of possibility to arrive at a conclusion, which is consistent with the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
