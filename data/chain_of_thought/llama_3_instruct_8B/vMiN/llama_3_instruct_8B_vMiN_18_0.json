This is equivalent to saying that it's possible for the notebook not to be in the drawer.\n\nThe premise states that the notebook might not be in the drawer, which implies that it's possible for the notebook not to be in the drawer.\n\nSince both the premise and conclusion are talking about the possibility of the notebook not being in the drawer, they are logically consistent with each other. The argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
