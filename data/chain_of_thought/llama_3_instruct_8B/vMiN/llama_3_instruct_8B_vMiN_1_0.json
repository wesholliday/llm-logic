The premise does not provide any information about whether Mary actually attended the wedding or not; it only suggests that it's possible she didn't.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows directly from the premise. If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it's indeed not the case that she must have been there. The conclusion does not contradict the premise, and the argument is sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
