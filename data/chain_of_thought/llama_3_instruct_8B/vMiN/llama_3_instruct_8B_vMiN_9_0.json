The premise is saying that it's possible (but not certain) that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, can we be sure that the conclusion is true if the premise is true?\n\nThe answer is yes. If Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, then it's indeed not the case that she must have bought it. The possibility of her not buying it implies the absence of necessity.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAnswer: yes",
