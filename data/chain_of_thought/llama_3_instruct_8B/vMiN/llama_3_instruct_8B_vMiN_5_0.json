The premise is saying that it's possible (but not certain) that Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, can we be sure that the conclusion is true if the premise is true?\n\nThe answer is yes. If it's possible that Jeff might not have played basketball (premise), then it's indeed not the case that he must have played basketball (conclusion). The two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
