This is equivalent to saying that it's possible for the watch not to be charging on the dresser.\n\nThe premise states that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, which implies that it's possible for the watch not to be charging on the dresser.\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are both talking about the possibility of the watch not being charged on the dresser, they are logically consistent. The argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
