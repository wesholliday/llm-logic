The premise supports this conclusion by stating that it is possible (i.e., \"might\") that Alex didn't finish.\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it uses a correct form of inference. The premise provides evidence for the conclusion, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise. Specifically, the premise states a possibility, which implies that the opposite possibility (Alex must have finished) cannot be true. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows: if Alex might not have finished, then it's not the case that Alex must have finished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
