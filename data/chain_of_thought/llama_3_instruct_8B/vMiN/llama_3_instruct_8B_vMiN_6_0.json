The premise is saying that it's possible (but not certain) that Sue didn't choose pizza.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, can we be sure that the conclusion is true if the premise is true?\n\nThe answer is yes. If Sue might not have chosen pizza, then it's indeed not the case that she must have chosen pizza. The possibility of Sue not choosing pizza implies the absence of necessity for her to choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
