This is equivalent to saying that it's possible for the toy not to be in the toy box.\n\nThe premise states that the toy might not be in the toy box, which implies that it's possible for the toy not to be in the toy box.\n\nSince both the premise and conclusion are talking about the possibility of the toy not being in the toy box, they are logically consistent with each other. The argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
