This can only be true if it is indeed possible for the griffin not to be in the forest, which is exactly what the premise states.\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. If the premise is true (i.e., the griffin might not have been in the forest), then the conclusion must also be true (i.e., it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest).\n\nAnswer: yes",
