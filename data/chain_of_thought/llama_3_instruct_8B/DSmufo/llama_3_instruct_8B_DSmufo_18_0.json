Therefore, this option is ruled out.\n* If the notebook is in the drawer, then it satisfies both statements: it's not on the nightstand (statement 1), and it's either on the nightstand or in the drawer (statement 2).\n\nSince we've eliminated one possibility and confirmed the other, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
