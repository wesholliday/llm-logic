            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" (\u00ac(Sunglasses are on her head))\n\t* \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\" ((Sunglasses are on her head) \u2228 (Sunglasses are in her bag))\n\n2. We can simplify the second statement by applying De Morgan's law to the negation of the first statement:\n\t* \u00ac(\u00ac(Sunglasses are on her head)) \u2228 (Sunglasses are in her bag)\n\t* (Sunglasses are on her head) \u2228 (Sunglasses are in her bag)\n\n3. Now we can see that the two statements are actually contradictory: if the sunglasses are not on her head, then they must be in her bag.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\t* The sunglasses are in her bag\n\nAnswer: yes",
