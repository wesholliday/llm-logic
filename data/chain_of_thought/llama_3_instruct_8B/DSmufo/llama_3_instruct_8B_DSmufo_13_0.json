Therefore, this scenario is unlikely.\n* If the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then statement 1 is true, and we know that either it must be sitting on the bookshelf or it's in the toy box (from statement 2). Since it's not sitting on the bookshelf, the only remaining option is that it's in the toy box.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
