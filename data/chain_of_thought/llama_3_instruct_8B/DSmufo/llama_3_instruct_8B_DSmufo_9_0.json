From 2, we have a disjunction where one of the options must be true (either the puzzle piece is on the floor or it's in the box).\n\nSince we've already established that the puzzle piece might not be on the floor (from statement 1), this means that the only remaining option is that the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
