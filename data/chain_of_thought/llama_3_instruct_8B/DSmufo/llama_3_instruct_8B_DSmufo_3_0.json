From (2), we know that either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (as stated in 1), then they must be in the drawer (since one of the two options in 2 must be true).\n* If the keys are dangling in the cabinet, then we can't conclude anything about whether they're in the drawer or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are indeed in the drawer. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: yes",
