This means that the first option in the disjunction (cookies must be hidden in the pantry) is false.\n\nSince the disjunction is either/or, and the first option is false, the second option (cookies are in the jar) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
