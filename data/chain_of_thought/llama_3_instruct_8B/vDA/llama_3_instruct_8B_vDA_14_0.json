            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf (bear in cave) \u2192 (wolf in den)\n\n2. The second premise is \"The bear was not in the cave\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00ac(bear in cave)\n\n3. We need to apply modus tollens to derive the conclusion. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement and its antecedent are false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n\u00ac(wolf in den) (since \u00ac(bear in cave) and (bear in cave) \u2192 (wolf in den))\n\nThe conclusion is \"The wolf was not in the den\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00ac(wolf in den)\n\nSince our inference follows logically from the premises, this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
