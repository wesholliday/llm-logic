            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\nThis premise states that there is an if-then relationship between the book being written by James and it being a mystery novel.\n\n2. Premise 2: \"The book was not written by James\"\nThis premise states that the book did not meet the condition specified in premise 1, i.e., it was not written by James.\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The book is not a mystery novel\"\nThis conclusion follows from the premises. If the book was not written by James (premise 2), and if being written by James implies that the book is a mystery novel (premise 1), then we can conclude that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe argument appears to be logically valid because it follows a correct pattern of inference:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q, \u00acP \u22a2 \u00acQ\n\nWhere P is \"the book was written by James\", Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\", and \u00ac denotes negation. The conclusion logically follows from the premises without any logical fallacies.\n\nAnswer: yes",
