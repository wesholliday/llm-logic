            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\".\n2. The second premise is \"Sue did not choose pizza\", which can be rewritten as \"~(Sue chose pizza)\".\n3. Using the first premise, we can infer that if Sue didn't choose pizza, then Bob didn't choose pasta. This can be written as \"~(Sue chose pizza) \u2192 ~Bob chose pasta\".\n4. Combining this with the second premise, we get \"~(Sue chose pizza) \u2192 ~Bob chose pasta\" and \"~(Sue chose pizza)\".\n5. Using modus ponens (a valid logical rule), we can conclude that \"~Bob chose pasta\".\n\nThe conclusion \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is equivalent to \"~Bob chose pasta\", so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
