            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be read as \"The apple being red implies the banana being yellow\".\n2. Premise 2: \"The apple was not red\"\nThis is a categorical statement that denies the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n3. Conclusion: \"The banana was not yellow\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the apple was not red. This means that the condition specified in premise 1 (the apple being red) is not met.\nSince the condition is not met, the implication stated in premise 1 does not hold. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the banana was yellow or not yellow.\n\nThe conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\" does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is invalid because it attempts to draw a conclusion about the banana's color based on the apple's color, but the connection between the two is only hypothetical and not actual.\n\nAnswer: no",
