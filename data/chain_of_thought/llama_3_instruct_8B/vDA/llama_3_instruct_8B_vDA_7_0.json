Premise: Alex did not finish the race\n3. Conclusion: Chris did not finish the race\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to see if it follows the rules of logical inference.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris also didn't finish the race (using modus tollens).\n\nUsing premise 2, we know that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, by applying the conditional statement from premise 1, we can conclude that Chris also did not finish the race.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, so this form of argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
