            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This is an if-then statement, which can be represented as a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n2. The second premise is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\", which can be represented as \u00acP.\n3. The conclusion is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", which we want to prove.\n\nUsing the rules of conditional statements, we can infer that if P is false (\u00acP), then Q must also be false:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThis is because if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, it's impossible for Mark to have bought the blue shirt based on the first premise.\n\nNow, we need to combine this inference with the second premise:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\u00acP (given)\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\n\u00acQ\n\nThis means that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is logically valid given the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
