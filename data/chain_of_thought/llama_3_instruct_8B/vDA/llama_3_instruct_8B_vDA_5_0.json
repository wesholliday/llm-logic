            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\nThis premise is a conditional statement, which means it states that if one thing happens (Jeff playing basketball), another thing will happen (Amy playing tennis).\n2. Premise: \"Jeff did not play basketball\"\nThis premise is a categorical statement, which means it simply asserts or denies the existence of something (in this case, Jeff playing basketball). It's negating the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n3. Conclusion: \"Amy did not play tennis\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 2 (\"Jeff did not play basketball\"), we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1 (Jeff playing basketball) is false.\nSince the antecedent is false, the consequent (Amy playing tennis) cannot be true. Therefore, it logically follows that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nThe conclusion (\"Amy did not play tennis\") follows necessarily from the premises, so this argument is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
