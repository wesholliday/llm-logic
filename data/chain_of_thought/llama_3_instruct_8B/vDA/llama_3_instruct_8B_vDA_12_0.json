            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf P (Joe went to the park) then Q (Lucy went to the zoo)\n\n2. The second premise is \"Joe did not go to the park\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acP (not Joe went to the park)\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\", which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acQ (not Lucy went to the zoo)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. But since Joe did not go to the park (premise 2), it does not follow that Lucy went to the zoo. In fact, it's possible that Lucy didn't go to the zoo at all.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" does not necessarily follow from the premises. The argument is invalid because it does not preserve the truth of the conclusion given the truth of the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
