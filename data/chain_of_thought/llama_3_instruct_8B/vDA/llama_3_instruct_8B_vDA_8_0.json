            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (This is a conditional statement, stating that if one condition is met, another condition will also be met.)\n2. Premise: The vampire was not awake (This is a categorical statement, stating that the vampire's state is not awake.)\n3. Conclusion: The mummy was not awake (This is an inference made from the premises.)\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine how the premises support the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, premise 2 states that the vampire is not awake. This means that the condition stated in premise 1 (the vampire being awake) is not met.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid argument form, we can infer that:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q, and \u00acP, then \u00acQ\n\nIn this case, P = \"The vampire was awake\", Q = \"The mummy was awake\", and \u00acP = \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\nIf (the vampire was awake) \u2192 (the mummy was awake), and \u00ac(the vampire was awake), then \u00ac(the mummy was awake)\n\nThis is equivalent to the original conclusion: The mummy was not awake.\n\nSince the argument follows a valid form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.",
