            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (This is a conditional statement, where if the antecedent \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequent \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.)\n2. Premise: Mary was not at the wedding (This is a factual statement that contradicts the antecedent of the first premise.)\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from these premises:\n\nIf Mary was not at the wedding (from premise 2), then it cannot be the case that Mary was at the wedding (since she wasn't). But this means that the conditional statement in premise 1 is no longer applicable. We cannot conclude anything about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the fact that Mary wasn't there.\n\nIn other words, the conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" does not logically follow from these premises. The argument is flawed because it tries to draw a conclusion about Sue's presence based on a conditional statement that no longer applies due to the contradictory information about Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
