This means that the possibility of the dreb being spent is ruled out.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2, which presents a disjunction: either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed. Since we know from statement 1 that the dreb cannot be spent (\u00ac(dreb must be spened)), we can eliminate the first option of the disjunction.\n\nThis leaves us with only one possibility: the dreb is vroombed. Therefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
