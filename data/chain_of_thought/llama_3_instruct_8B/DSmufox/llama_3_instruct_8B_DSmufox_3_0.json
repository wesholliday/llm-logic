To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. From statement 2, we know that either Q or M must be true.\n2. From statement 1, we know that \u00acQ is true. This means that Q cannot be true.\n3. Since Q cannot be true, and Q \u2228 M is true (from statement 2), it follows that M must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed (M).\n\nAnswer: yes",
