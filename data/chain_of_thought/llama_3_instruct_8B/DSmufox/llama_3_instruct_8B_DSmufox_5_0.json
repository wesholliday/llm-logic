This means that Z does not imply S. In other words, the zinger being smoogled is not a necessary condition for it to be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that (Z \u2192 S) \u2228 F. This means that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. Since \u00ac(Z \u2192 S), we can conclude that Z \u2192 S is false. Therefore, the only remaining option is that F is true.\n\nSo, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
