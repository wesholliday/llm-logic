This means that the implication \"the flugel must be zargled\" (F \u2192 Z) is false. In other words, F does not imply Z.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: (F \u2192 Z) \u2228 B. This says that either F implies Z or the flugel is blimmed (B).\n\nWe can combine these two statements by using the contrapositive of statement 1:\n\n\u00ac(F \u2192 Z) \u2192 \u00acZ\n\nThis means that if it's not the case that F implies Z, then Z must be false.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" (B). We can do this by using the contrapositive of statement 2:\n\n(F \u2192 Z) \u2228 B \u2192 B\n\nSince we know that \u00ac(F \u2192 Z), we can substitute this into the above statement:\n\n\u00acZ \u2228 B \u2192 B\n\nUsing the fact that \u00acZ, we get:\n\nB \u2192 B\n\nThis is a tautology, which means that it's always true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The flugel is blimmed\" (B) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
