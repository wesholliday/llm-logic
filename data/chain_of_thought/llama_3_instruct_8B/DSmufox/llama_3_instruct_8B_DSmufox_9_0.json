This is because the first statement tells us that it's possible for the twonk not to be plinked, and the second statement presents a disjunction where one of the options (the twonk being plinked or varnished) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished. This means that we can infer \"The twonk is varnished\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
