This implies that T \u2227 (T \u2228 S) is false.\n\nSince T \u2227 (T \u2228 S) is false, either T or (T \u2228 S) must be false. If T were true, then T \u2227 (T \u2228 S) would be true, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, T must be false.\n\nNow, we can conclude that \u00acT.\n\nFrom (2), we know that T \u2228 S is true. Since T is false, this implies that S must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\nThe whiffle is shanked\n\nAnswer: yes",
