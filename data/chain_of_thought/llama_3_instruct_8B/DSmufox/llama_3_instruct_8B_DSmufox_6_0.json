This means that either the grommet must be plopped (P) or it is sploffed (S), but not necessarily both.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 1: \u00acP. This states that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nWe can combine these two statements by applying De Morgan's law to \u00acP and P \u2228 S:\n\n\u00ac(P \u2228 S) \u2192 \u00acP \u2227 \u00acS\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\u00acP \u2227 \u00acS\n\nSince we know that \u00acP (from statement 1), we can conclude that:\n\n\u00acS\n\nThis means that it is not the case that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no",
