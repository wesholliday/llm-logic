This means that if G (the glip) does not imply T (being tragged), then it's true.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement 2: (G \u2192 T) \u2228 S. This is a disjunction of two statements:\n\n* (G \u2192 T): If G implies T, then either G must be tragged or it's slogged.\n* S: The glip is slogged.\n\nWe can simplify the disjunction by applying De Morgan's law to \u00ac(G \u2192 T):\n\n\u00ac((G \u2192 T) \u2228 S) = \u00ac(G \u2192 T) \u2227 \u00acS\n\nSince we know that \u00ac(G \u2192 T) is true (from statement 1), we can conclude:\n\n\u00ac(G \u2192 T) \u2227 \u00acS\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The glip is slogged\" (S). We can do this by applying modus tollens to the above equation:\n\n\u00acS \u2192 \u00ac((G \u2192 T) \u2228 S)\n\u00acS \u2192 \u00ac(G \u2192 T) \u2227 \u00acS\n\u00acS \u2192 \u00ac(G \u2192 T)\n\nSince we know that \u00ac(G \u2192 T) is true, we can conclude:\n\n\u00acS\n\nThis means that \"The glip is not slogged\" (\u00acS). Therefore, we cannot infer \"The glip is slogged\" (S).\n\nAnswer: no",
