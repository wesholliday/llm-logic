This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer a new statement: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\".\n3. To do this, we need to negate both parts of the original statement:\n\t* If the condition (\"the doll was plastic\") is negated, it becomes \"the doll was not plastic\".\n\t* If the consequence (\"the truck was metal\") is negated, it becomes \"the truck was not metal\".\n\nNow, let's examine the new statement: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\". This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if we swap the condition and consequence of the original statement, we get the same relationship.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
