This implies that there is a relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins.\n3. If we negate the antecedent (the cake being chocolate), we get \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n4. We can't directly conclude that the muffins are not blueberry, because there might be other possibilities for the muffin flavor.\n\nFor example, if the cake is vanilla, it doesn't necessarily mean the muffins are not blueberry; they could still be blueberry.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
