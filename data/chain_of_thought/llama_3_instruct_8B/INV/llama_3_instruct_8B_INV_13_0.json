            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The given statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer another statement: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\".\n3. To do this, we need to find a logical connection between the two statements.\n\nNotice that the original statement only talks about what happens when the car is red, but it doesn't say anything about what happens when the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nHowever, we can use a technique called \"contrapositive\" to help us out. The contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\". This means that if the truck is not blue, then the car cannot be red.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement we want to infer: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\". We can rewrite this as: \"If the car was not red, then it's not true that the truck is blue\".\n\nUsing the contrapositive technique, we can see that if the car is not red, then the truck cannot be blue. This means that the second statement is actually a logical consequence of the first one!\n\nAnswer: yes",
