This is an if-then statement, which means that the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn.\n2. We want to know if we can infer the converse: \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\".\n3. To determine this, let's consider a scenario where the griffin is not in the forest. In this case, the original statement does not provide any information about the presence or absence of the unicorn.\n4. The original statement only talks about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn when the griffin is present in the forest. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the griffin is absent.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
