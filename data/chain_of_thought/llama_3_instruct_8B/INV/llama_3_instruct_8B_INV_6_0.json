This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer another statement: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\".\n3. To do this, we need to find a connection between the original statement and the inferred statement.\n\nNotice that the original statement is saying that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta. This implies that when Sue doesn't choose pizza, Bob might still choose pasta (since there's no direct contradiction).\n\nHowever, the inferred statement is saying that if Sue didn't choose pizza, then Bob definitely did not choose pasta. This is a stronger claim than what we can infer from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first one. The relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice is not strong enough to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
