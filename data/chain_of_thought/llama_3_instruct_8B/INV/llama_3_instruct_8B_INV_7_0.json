This statement implies that there is a direct relationship between Alex finishing the race and Chris finishing the face.\n3. If we negate the antecedent (Alex finishing the race), we get \"If Alex didn't finish the race\".\n4. Since the original statement only provides information about the relationship between Alex's action and Chris's action when Alex finishes the race, it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Alex doesn't finish the race.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Chris's action (finishing or not finishing) based on Alex's action (not finishing) alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
