This implies that there is a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n3. Specifically, the statement suggests that if Tom watches football, Jen will also watch basketball.\n4. Now, let's consider the converse: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\".\n5. We can infer from the original statement that if Tom doesn't watch football, it's possible that Jen might still watch basketball (since there is no direct correlation between Tom not watching football and Jen not watching basketball).\n6. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that Jen will definitely not watch basketball if Tom doesn't watch football.\n7. Therefore, the original statement does not provide enough information to infer the converse.\n\nAnswer: no",
