This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate eating salad) must also be true.\n2. We want to know if we can infer another statement: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\".\n3. To determine this, let's analyze the original statement again. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that there is a direct correlation between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n4. However, we cannot directly conclude that if Ben does not eat pasta, Kate will not eat salad. The original statement only provides information about what happens when Ben eats pasta, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when he doesn't eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement with certainty. There might be other scenarios where Kate still eats salad even if Ben does not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
