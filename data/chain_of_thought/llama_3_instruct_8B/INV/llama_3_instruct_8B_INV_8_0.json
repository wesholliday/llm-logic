This statement implies a direct correlation between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness.\n3. If we negate the antecedent (the condition) of the original statement, i.e., \"The vampire was not awake\", we get a new conditional statement: \"If the vampire was not awake\".\n4. Since the original statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, it's reasonable to assume that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is likely not awake as well.\n5. Therefore, we can infer a new conditional statement: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
