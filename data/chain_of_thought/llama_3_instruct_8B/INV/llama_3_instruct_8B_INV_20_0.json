This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n2. We want to infer another statement: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\".\n3. To do this, we need to negate both parts of the original statement:\n\t* Negate the antecedent: Instead of \"the apple was red\", it becomes \"the apple was not red\" (or simply \"the apple is not red\").\n\t* Negate the consequent: Instead of \"the banana was yellow\", it becomes \"the banana was not yellow\".\n4. Now we have a new conditional statement: \"If the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow\". This statement is logically equivalent to the original one.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
