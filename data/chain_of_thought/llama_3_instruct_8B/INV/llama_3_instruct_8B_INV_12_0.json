However, it does not imply that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\", we would need additional information or a stronger connection between the two events. The original statement only provides a positive correlation (if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo), but does not provide any evidence for a negative correlation (if Joe doesn't go to the park, then Lucy doesn't go to the zoo).\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
