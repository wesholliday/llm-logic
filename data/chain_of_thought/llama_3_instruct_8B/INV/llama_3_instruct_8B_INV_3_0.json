This statement implies that there is a relationship between the author being James and the book being a mystery novel.\n3. To infer the converse statement, we need to consider what would happen if the condition \"the book was not written by James\" were true.\n4. If the book was not written by James, then it's possible that the book could still be a mystery novel (e.g., it was written by someone else).\n5. However, it's also possible that the book is not a mystery novel if it wasn't written by James (e.g., it was written by someone who doesn't typically write mystery novels).\n\nSince we can't conclude with certainty whether the book is or isn't a mystery novel based on the authorship alone, we cannot infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
