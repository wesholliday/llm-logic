This implies that there is a direct correlation between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n3. If we negate the antecedent (the condition) of the original statement, we get \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n4. Since the original statement only mentions the relationship between Lisa's action and Mark's action when she buys the red shirt, it does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Mark's action (buying or not buying the blue shirt) based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
