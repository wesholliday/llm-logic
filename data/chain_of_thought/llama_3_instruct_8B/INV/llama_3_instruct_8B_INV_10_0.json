This implies that when the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.\n3. However, this does not imply that if the dog is not inside, the cat must be not outside.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that when the dog is inside, the cat is outside, it doesn't mean that when the dog is not inside, the cat is necessarily not outside. There could be other scenarios where the dog is not inside and the cat is still outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
