This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n2. We want to know if we can infer the converse of this statement: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement as well, but with the opposite condition and consequence.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this converse, let's consider what would happen if Mary were not at the wedding. In that case, the original statement would be false (since Mary being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Sue to be at the wedding). However, just because the original statement is false doesn't mean that Sue was necessarily not at the wedding.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Sue was at the wedding even though Mary wasn't. Maybe Sue had already RSVP'd and arrived before Mary changed her mind or couldn't attend. In this scenario, the converse of the original statement would be true (Mary wasn't at the wedding, but Sue was).\n\nSince we can think of a counterexample where the converse is true while the original statement is false, we cannot infer the converse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
