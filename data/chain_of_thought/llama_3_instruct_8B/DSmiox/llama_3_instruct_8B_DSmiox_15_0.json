This implies that if the dreb is not spended, then it must be vroombed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. From statement 1, we know that the dreb might not be spended. If this is the case, then from statement 2, we can conclude that the dreb must be vroombed (since it cannot be spened).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
