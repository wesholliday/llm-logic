The \"must\" implies a necessity, which means that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nNow, let's combine this information. Since the twonk might not be plinked (from statement 1), we can conclude that it must be varnished (from statement 2). This is because the only alternative to being plinked is being varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
