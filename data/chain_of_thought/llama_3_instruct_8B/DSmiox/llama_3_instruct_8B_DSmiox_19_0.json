The word \"either\" indicates that these are the only two possible options.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the smonk might not be plagged (statement 1), then it cannot be the case that it must be plagged (since it might not). Therefore, we can conclude that the second option (\"it must be plagged\") is not true.\n\nSince the only other option is \"the smonk is vreebled\" (from statement 2), and we have eliminated the alternative, we can infer that:\n\nThe smonk is indeed vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
