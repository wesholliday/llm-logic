The use of \"either\" suggests that these are the only two possible scenarios.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the flugel might not be zargled (statement 1), then it's possible that it's not zargled. According to statement 2, if it's not zargled, then it must be blimmed. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
