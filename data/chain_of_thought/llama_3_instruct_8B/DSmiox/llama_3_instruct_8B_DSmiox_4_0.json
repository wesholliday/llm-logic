This implies that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. Since the fribble might not be crinked (from statement 1), and if it's not crinked, then it must be snurgled (from statement 2), we can infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
