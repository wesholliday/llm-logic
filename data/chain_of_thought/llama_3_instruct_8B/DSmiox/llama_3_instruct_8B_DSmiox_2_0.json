This means that if the wug is not bimmed (as stated in statement 1), then it must be flooped.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\n* The wug might not be bimmed (given)\n* If the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped (from statement 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
