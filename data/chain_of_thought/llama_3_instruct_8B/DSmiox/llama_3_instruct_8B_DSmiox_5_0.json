This means that if the zinger is not smoogled (as stated in statement 1), then it must be fraggled.\n\nSince we know that the zinger might not be smoogled (from statement 1), and we also know that if it's not smoogled, it must be fraggled (from statement 2), we can conclude that:\n\nThe zinger is fraggled\n\nAnswer: yes",
