This is because the statement presents two mutually exclusive options: either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. If it's not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nNow, let's combine this information with the initial statement (1). Since the possibility of the whiffle being tinked is uncertain, we can't conclude that it's definitely not tinked. However, if it's not tinked, then it must be shanked (from statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle might be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
