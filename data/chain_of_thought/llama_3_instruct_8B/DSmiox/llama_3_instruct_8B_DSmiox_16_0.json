This means that if the sneg is not sproted (as stated in statement 1), then it must be crampled.\n\nUsing logical deduction, we can conclude that:\n\nIf the sneg might not be sproted (statement 1), and either it's crampled or it must be sproted (statement 2), then it follows that the sneg is indeed crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
