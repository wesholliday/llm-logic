This implies that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. Since the grommet might not be plopped (from statement 1), and if it's not plopped, then it must be sploffed (from statement 2), we can infer that the grommet is indeed sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
