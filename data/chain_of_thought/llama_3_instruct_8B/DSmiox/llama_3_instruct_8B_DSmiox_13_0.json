This implies that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf the glip might not be tragged (from statement 1), and if it's not tragged, then it must be slogged (from statement 2), we can conclude that the glip is indeed slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
