This implies that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the clug might not be snugged (from statement 1), and if it's not snugged, then it must be fleeked (from statement 2), we can infer that the clug is indeed fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
