This implies that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned. From statement 2, if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nSince we've established that there is a possibility the fleeg is not surned (from statement 1), and if it's not surned, it must be bluttered (from statement 2), we can conclude that the fleeg is indeed bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
