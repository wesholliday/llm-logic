This implies that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, we can conclude that since the sprocket might not be daggled (from statement 1), and if it's not daggled, then it must be cranked (from statement 2), we can infer that the sprocket is indeed cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
