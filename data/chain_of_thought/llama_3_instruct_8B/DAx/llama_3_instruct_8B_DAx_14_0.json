From statement 1, we can conclude that if the clug is not fleeked (which is given in statement 2), then it must be true that the clug did not snugged.\n3. This is because the conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" implies a causal relationship between being fleeked and snugging. If the clug is not fleeked, then this causal relationship does not apply, and we cannot conclude that it snugged.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the clug was not snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
