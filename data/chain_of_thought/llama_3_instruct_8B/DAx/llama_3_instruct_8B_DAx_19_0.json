From the first statement, we can conclude that if the smonk is vreebled, it will plague. But this does not mean that if the smonk is not vreebled, it won't plague.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the smonk was not vreebled. This means we can eliminate the possibility of the smonk being vreebled.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily imply that the smonk did not plague. It's possible that the smonk plagued even though it wasn't vreebled.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the smonk was not plagued.\n\nAnswer: no",
