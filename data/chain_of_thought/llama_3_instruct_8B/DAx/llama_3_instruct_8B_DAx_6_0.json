From statement 2, we know that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the first statement: If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. Since the grommet was not sploffed (from statement 2), this condition is not met.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the grommet did or did not plop the frink based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
