From statement 2, we know that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\n3. Since the whiffle was not shanked (from statement 2), it cannot be true that the whiffle was shanked (from statement 1).\n\n4. If the whiffle was not shanked, then the conclusion \"The whiffle tinked\" from statement 1 does not apply.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
