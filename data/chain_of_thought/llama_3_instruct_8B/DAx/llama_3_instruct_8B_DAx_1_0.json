The flugel was not blimmed.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can conclude that if the flugel is blimmed, it must be zargled. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the flugel was not blimmed. This statement does not mention anything about zargling.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information that connects not being blimmed to not being zargled, we cannot infer that the flugel was not zargled solely based on statements (1) and (2).\n\nAnswer: no",
