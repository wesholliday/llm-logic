From statement 2, we know that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\n3. Since the sprocket was not cranked, we cannot conclude that it was daggled or not daggled based on the first statement alone. The first statement only provides a conditional relationship between being cranked and being daggled, but it does not provide information about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the sprocket was daggled or not based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
