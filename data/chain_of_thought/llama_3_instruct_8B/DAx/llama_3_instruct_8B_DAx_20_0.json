The fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can infer that if the fleeg is bluttered, it will surn. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the fleeg is not bluttered. Now, let's combine this with statement (1). Since the fleeg is not bluttered, we cannot apply the conditional statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" because the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the fleeg did or did not surn. The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusion about the outcome of the fleeg's surning.\n\nAnswer: no",
