The splat was not morphed.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can infer that if the splat is morphed, it will quank. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the splat is not morphed.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the splat was not morphed. Now, let's combine this with statement (1). Since the splat was not morphed, we cannot apply the condition in statement (1), which states that if the splat is morphed, it will quank. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the splat did or did not quank.\n\nAnswer: no",
