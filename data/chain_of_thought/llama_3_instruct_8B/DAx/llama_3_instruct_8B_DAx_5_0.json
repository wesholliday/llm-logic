We have two statements:\n\t* If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (conditional statement)\n\t* The zinger was not fraggled (contradictory statement)\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the zinger is not fraggled, it cannot be smoogled.\n\n3. Since the second statement says the zinger is not fraggled, we can apply this inference to conclude that the zinger cannot be smoogled.\n\n4. Therefore, we can logically infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
