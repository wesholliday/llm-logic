From the second statement, we know that the flug is not blummed.\n\n3. Since the first statement says \"If the flug was blummed\", and we know it's not blummed, this condition is not met.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the flug was zimmed or not, because the condition for the implication to hold (the flug being blummed) is not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: no",
