The wug was not sproinged (contradictory statement)\n\nWe can infer that the wug is not sproinged because of statement 2.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the wug was not garpled from these statements alone. The conditional statement only tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it would be garpled, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the wug is not sproinged.\n\nIn other words, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n* Scenario 1: The wug is sproinged and therefore garpled.\n* Scenario 2: The wug is not sproinged (which we know to be true), but it could still be garpled or not garpled. We have no information about this.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not garpled from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
