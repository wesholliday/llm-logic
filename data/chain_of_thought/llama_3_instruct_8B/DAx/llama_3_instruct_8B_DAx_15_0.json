From statement 2, we know that the condition \"the dreb was not vroombed\" is true.\n\n3. Since the condition in statement 1 is \"the dreb was vroombed\", which is false (given by statement 2), we cannot apply the implication \"then the dreb was spended\".\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dreb was not spened.\n\nAnswer: no",
