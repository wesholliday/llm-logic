The sneg was not crampled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can infer that if the sneg is crampled, it will sprot the frink. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the sneg is not crampled.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the sneg was not crampled. Now, let's combine this with statement (1). Since the sneg was not crampled, we cannot apply the condition in statement (1), which only applies to the case where the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude whether the sneg sproted the frink or not based on these statements. We simply don't have enough information.\n\nAnswer: no",
