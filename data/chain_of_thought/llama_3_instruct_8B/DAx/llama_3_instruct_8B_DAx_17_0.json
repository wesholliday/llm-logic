The flob was not skizzled.\n\nFrom statement (1), we can infer that if the flob is skizzled, it will move. But this does not provide any information about what happens when the flob is NOT skizzled.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the flob is indeed NOT skizzled.\n\nNow, let's think about the original statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\". Since we know the flob is not skizzled (from statement 2), this conditional statement does not apply to our situation. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the flob moved or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
