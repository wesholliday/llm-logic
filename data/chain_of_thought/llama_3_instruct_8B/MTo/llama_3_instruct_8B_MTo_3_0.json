We have two statements:\n\t* \"The book is not a mystery novel\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B implies that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel.\n3. Since Statement A says the book is NOT a mystery novel, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nReasoning: If the book were written by James, it would be a mystery novel (Statement B), but since it's not (Statement A), then it must have been written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: yes",
