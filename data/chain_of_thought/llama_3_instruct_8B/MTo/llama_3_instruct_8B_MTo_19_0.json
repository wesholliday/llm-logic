            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* Jen did not watch basketball (Jen \u2209 Basketball)\n\t* If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (Tom \u2192 Jen \u222a Basketball)\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if Tom watches football, Jen will also watch basketball.\n\n3. Since Jen did not watch basketball (Jen \u2209 Basketball), it means she didn't watch basketball even if Tom watched football.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the possibility that Tom watched football. If he did, then according to the second statement, Jen would have watched basketball as well. But we know that's not the case (Jen \u2209 Basketball).\n\n5. Therefore, it must be the case that Tom did not watch football. Otherwise, Jen would have watched basketball, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nAnswer: yes",
