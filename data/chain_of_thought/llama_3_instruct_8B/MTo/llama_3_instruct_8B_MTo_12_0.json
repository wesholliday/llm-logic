We are given two statements:\n\t* \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" (L)\n\t* \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (J \u2192 L)\n2. From statement J \u2192 L, we can infer that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy will go to the zoo.\n3. However, statement L tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n4. Since Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it's possible that Joe went to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (which would contradict J \u2192 L).\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
