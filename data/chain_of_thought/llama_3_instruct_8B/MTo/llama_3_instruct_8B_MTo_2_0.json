            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* \"The unicorn was not in the forest\"\n\t* \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\n3. The second statement says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. This implies a conditional relationship between the griffin's presence and the unicorn's presence.\n\n4. Since we already know that the unicorn is not in the forest (from statement 1), it means that the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" cannot be true.\n\n5. If the condition cannot be true, then the conclusion \"then the unicorn was in the forest\" also cannot be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin is not in the forest, because if it were, the unicorn would also be in the forest (according to statement 2), but we know the unicorn is not in the forest (from statement 1).\n\nAnswer: yes",
