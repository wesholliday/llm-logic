From the first statement, we know that Bob did not choose pasta.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This means that if Sue had chosen pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta.\n4. However, we are also given information that Bob did not choose pasta (from the first statement). This implies that Sue did not choose pizza, because if she had, Bob would have chosen pasta, but he didn't.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
