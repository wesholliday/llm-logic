From statement (1), we know that the muffins are not blueberry.\n3. Statement (2) is a conditional statement. It says that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. This implies that there is a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n4. Since the muffins are not blueberry (from step 2), we can conclude that the cake cannot be chocolate. If the cake were chocolate, the muffins would have to be blueberry, but they're not. This creates a contradiction.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
