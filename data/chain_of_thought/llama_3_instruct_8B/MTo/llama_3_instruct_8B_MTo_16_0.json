From statement (1), we know that the pants are not denim.\n3. Statement (2) is a conditional statement. It says that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants would be denim. But since we already know from step 2 that the pants are not denim, this means that the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nSo, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
