From statement S \u2192 E, we can infer that if Sam takes a plane, Erin must have taken a train.\n3. However, we also know that Erin did not take a train (E).\n4. This means that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" cannot be true, because if it were, Erin would have taken a train, which contradicts statement E.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
