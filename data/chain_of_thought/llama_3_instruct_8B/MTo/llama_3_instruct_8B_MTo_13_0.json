            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n\t* The truck was not blue (T)\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (C \u2192 T')\n2. We want to infer whether the car was not red (\u00acR).\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens: \u00ac(C \u2192 T') \u2192 \u00acC\n4. Since we know that T is true (the truck was not blue), we can substitute T' with T:\n\t* \u00ac(C \u2192 T) \u2192 \u00acC\n5. Now, we can combine the two statements:\n\t* The truck was not blue (T)\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (C \u2192 T')\n6. We can rewrite the second statement as its contrapositive: \u00acT \u2192 \u00acC\n7. Since we know that T is true, we can substitute it with false:\n\t* \u00acF \u2192 \u00acC\n8. This implies that \u00acC is true, which means the car was not red (\u00acR).\n\nAnswer: yes",
