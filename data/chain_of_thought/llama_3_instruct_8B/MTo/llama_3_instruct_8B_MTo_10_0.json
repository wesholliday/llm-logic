From the first statement, we know that the cat is not outside.\n3. The second statement says that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside. This implies that if the dog is not inside, the cat might be outside (but it's not necessarily true).\n4. Since we already know that the cat is not outside (from statement 1), this means that the dog must be inside for the cat to be outside.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
