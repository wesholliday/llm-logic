From statement (1), we know that the truck is not metal.\n3. Statement (2) gives us a conditional relationship between the doll's material and the truck's material. It says that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal.\n4. Since the truck is not metal (from step 2), it means that the condition in statement (2) cannot be true. In other words, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nNow, we can infer that the doll is not plastic because if it were plastic, the truck would have to be metal, but we know the truck is not metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
