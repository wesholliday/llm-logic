We have two statements:\n\t* \"Sue was not at the wedding\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that Sue was not at the wedding (Statement A), this implies that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" cannot be true.\n4. If the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" were true, then Statement B would require Sue to be at the wedding as well, which contradicts Statement A.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
