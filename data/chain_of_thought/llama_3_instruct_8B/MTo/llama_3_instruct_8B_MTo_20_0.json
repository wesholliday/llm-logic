From the second statement, we can infer that if the apple is NOT red, then the banana is NOT yellow (since the opposite of \"if\" is \"unless\").\n3. We are also given that the banana is actually NOT yellow.\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the apple is NOT red, then the banana is not yellow.\n5. This means that if the apple IS red, then the banana would be yellow (since the opposite of \"if\" is \"unless\"). But since we know the banana is not yellow, this implies that the apple cannot be red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
