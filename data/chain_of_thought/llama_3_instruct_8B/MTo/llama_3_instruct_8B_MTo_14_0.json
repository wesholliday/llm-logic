From statement (1), we know that the wolf is not in the den.\n3. Statement (2) gives us a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. If the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den.\n4. Since we know the wolf is not in the den (from statement 1), it means that the condition \"the bear was in the cave\" cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
