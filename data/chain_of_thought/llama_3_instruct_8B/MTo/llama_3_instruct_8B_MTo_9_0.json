            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* Mark did not buy the blue shirt (M\u00acB)\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (L\u2192MB)\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark wouldn't have bought the blue shirt. We can write this as \u00acL \u2192 \u00acMB.\n3. Now, we combine statements 1 and 2 using logical operators:\n\t* M\u00acB (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n\t* \u00acL \u2192 \u00acMB (If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark wouldn't have bought the blue shirt)\n4. Using modus tollens, we can infer that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt:\n\t* M\u00acB \u2192 \u00ac(L\u2192MB) (Mark did not buy the blue shirt implies it's not true that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt)\n5. However, we cannot directly infer that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
