We are given two statements:\n\t* Chris did not finish the race (C)\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (A \u2192 C)\n2. From statement A \u2192 C, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n3. However, we are told that Chris did not finish the race (C). This means that Chris's finishing status is already known to be false.\n4. Now, let's examine the possibility of Alex finishing the race. If Alex finished the race, then according to statement A \u2192 C, Chris would also have finished the race. But we know that Chris didn't finish the race (C), so this means that Alex cannot have finished the race either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that:\n\nAlex did not finish the race\n\nAnswer: yes",
