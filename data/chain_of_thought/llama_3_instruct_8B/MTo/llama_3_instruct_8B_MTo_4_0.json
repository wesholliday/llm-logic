We are given two statements:\n\t* The robot did not visit Jupiter (R)\n\t* If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (A \u2192 R)\n2. We want to infer whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n3. From statement A \u2192 R, we can conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter. But since the robot did not visit Jupiter (R), this means that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nReasoning: If the alien had visited Mars, the robot would have visited Jupiter, but since the robot didn't visit Jupiter, it's likely that the alien didn't visit Mars either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
