We are given two statements:\n\t* \"Kate did not eat the salad\" (K \u00acS)\n\t* \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" (B \u2192 K)\n\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if Ben didn't eat pasta (\u00acB), it doesn't affect our conclusion about Kate eating the salad. This is because the conditional statement only talks about the relationship between Ben's action and Kate's action when he eats pasta.\n\n3. Since we know Kate did not eat the salad (K \u00acS), we can conclude that Ben must have eaten pasta for Kate to eat the salad, given the conditional statement (B \u2192 K). This is because if Ben didn't eat pasta, Kate would still not eat the salad, which contradicts our initial conclusion.\n\n4. Therefore, since Ben must have eaten pasta for Kate not to eat the salad, we can infer that Ben did eat pasta (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
