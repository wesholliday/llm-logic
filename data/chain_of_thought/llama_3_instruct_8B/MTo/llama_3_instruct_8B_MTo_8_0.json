The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\n3. However, we are given information that contradicts the consequence: \"The mummy was not awake\". This means that the condition (the vampire being awake) cannot be true, because if it were, the mummy would have to be awake, but it's not.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition (the vampire being awake) is false.\n\n5. Since the condition is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the statement \"The vampire was not awake\". We only know that the vampire is not awake because of the first statement (\"The mummy was not awake\"), but we don't have enough information to conclude that the vampire is definitely not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
