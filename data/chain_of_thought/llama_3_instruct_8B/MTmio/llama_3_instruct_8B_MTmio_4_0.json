We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\"\n\t* \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\"\n2. The second statement implies that if the alien visits Mars, the robot will visit Jupiter. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars.\n3. We are asked to infer whether the alien did or did not visit Mars based on the given statements.\n4. Since we don't have any direct evidence about the alien's visit to Mars, we cannot conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
