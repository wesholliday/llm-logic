From the second statement, we can infer that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. This implies that there is a connection between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's mode of transportation.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"Erin might not have taken a train.\" This means that it is possible that Erin did not take a train.\n\n4. Combining this with the second statement, we can conclude that if Erin didn't take a train (as stated in the first statement), then Sam must not have taken a plane (since Erin would have taken a train if Sam took a plane).\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
