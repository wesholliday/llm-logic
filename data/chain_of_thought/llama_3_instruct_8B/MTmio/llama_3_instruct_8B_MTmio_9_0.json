            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (MS)\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (ILMB)\n2. From ILMB, we can infer that if Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark will buy the blue shirt.\n3. However, MS states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means it's possible that he didn't buy it.\n4. Now, let's consider the possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt (LR). If LR is true, then ILMB implies that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (MB).\n5. But MS says Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts MB. This means that LR cannot be true.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
