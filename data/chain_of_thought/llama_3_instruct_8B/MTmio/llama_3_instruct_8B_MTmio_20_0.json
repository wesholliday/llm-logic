We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The banana might not have been yellow\"\n\t* \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\"\n2. From statement (2), we can infer that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow.\n3. However, statement (1) tells us that the banana might not have been yellow, which means it's possible that the banana wasn't yellow.\n4. Now, let's consider the possibility that the apple is red. If this were the case, we would know from statement (2) that the banana must be yellow. But since statement (1) tells us that the banana might not have been yellow, this means that the apple cannot be red.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
