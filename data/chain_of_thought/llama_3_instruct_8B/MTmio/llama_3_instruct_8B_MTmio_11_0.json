We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\"\n\t* \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n2. The second statement implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. This means that the muffins cannot be blueberry unless the cake is chocolate.\n3. We don't know what type of cake it is (chocolate or not). However, we can conclude that if the muffins might not have been blueberry, then the cake must not be chocolate.\n4. If the cake were chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry, but since they might not have been blueberry, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
