            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\n\t* If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not. We only know that if he did go, Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n4. Since we don't know whether Joe went to the park or not, we can't conclude anything about his actions based on the second statement alone.\n5. The first statement tells us that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, but it doesn't provide any information about Joe's actions.\n\nGiven these steps, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park from the given statements. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
