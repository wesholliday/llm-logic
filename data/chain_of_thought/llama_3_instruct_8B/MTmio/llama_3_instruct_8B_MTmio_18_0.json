We are given two statements:\n\t* The truck might not have been metal.\n\t* If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. From statement (2), we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This implies a conditional relationship between the doll's material and the truck's material.\n3. We are asked to infer whether the doll was not plastic based on the given statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the doll is plastic, then statement (2) tells us that the truck must be metal. But we know from statement (1) that the truck might not have been metal, which creates a contradiction.\n* Therefore, it's unlikely that the doll is plastic.\n\nBy process of elimination, we can conclude that the doll is likely not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
