We are given two statements:\n\t* The pants might not have been denim.\n\t* If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n2. From statement (1), we know that there is a possibility that the pants are not denim.\n3. From statement (2), we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This implies that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants might not be denim (since it's not necessarily true).\n4. We want to infer whether the shirt was not cotton.\n\nNotice that statement (1) only provides a possibility about the pants being denim or not, but doesn't give us any information about the shirt. Statement (2) gives us a conditional relationship between the shirt and pants, but we can't conclude anything about the shirt's material from this alone.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to make a conclusion about the shirt's material, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: no",
