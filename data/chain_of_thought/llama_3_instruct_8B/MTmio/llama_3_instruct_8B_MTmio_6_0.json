The second statement implies that if Sue chooses pizza, Bob will choose pasta. This is a conditional statement.\n3. However, the first statement says that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means there's a possibility he didn't choose it.\n4. Since we don't know for sure whether Bob chose pasta or not, we can't conclude anything about Sue's choice (pizza or not).\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
