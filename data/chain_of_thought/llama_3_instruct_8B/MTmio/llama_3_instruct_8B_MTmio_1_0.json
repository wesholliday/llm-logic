            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\"\n\t* \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n2. The second statement implies that if Mary is present, Sue will also be present.\n3. However, the first statement suggests that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain or possible but not guaranteed.\n4. We want to infer whether Mary was at the wedding based on these statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Mary was at the wedding (Mary), then according to the second statement, Sue must have been at the wedding too (Sue). But this contradicts the first statement, which says Sue might not have been at the wedding. This is a logical contradiction.\n* Therefore, it's more likely that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acMary) to avoid this contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
