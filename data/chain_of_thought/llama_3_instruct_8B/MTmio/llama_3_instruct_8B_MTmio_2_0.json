            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\"\n\t* \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\"\n\n2. From statement 2, we can infer that if the griffin is in the forest, it implies that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\". This means that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4. Since we don't know for certain whether the unicorn was or wasn't in the forest, we can't conclude anything about the griffin being in the forest based on this statement alone.\n\n5. However, combining both statements, we can see that if the griffin is in the forest (which we don't know), it would imply that the unicorn must be in the forest as well (according to statement 2). But since we already know that the unicorn might not have been in the forest (statement 1), this implies that the griffin cannot be in the forest.\n\n6. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
