We are given two statements:\n\t* \"Chris might not have finished the race\"\n\t* \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\"\n2. The second statement implies that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish the race.\n3. However, we don't know whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n4. Since we only have information about the relationship between Alex and Chris's finishing the race, we cannot conclude anything about Alex's actual performance in the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Alex did not finish the race\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
