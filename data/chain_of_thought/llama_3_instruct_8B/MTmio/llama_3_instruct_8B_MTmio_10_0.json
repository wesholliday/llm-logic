We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The cat might not have been outside\"\n\t* \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\"\n2. From the first statement, we know that there is a possibility (not certainty) that the cat was not outside.\n3. The second statement tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This implies that the dog being inside is a sufficient condition for the cat to be outside.\n4. Now, let's assume that the dog was indeed inside. Then, according to the second statement, the cat must have been outside.\n5. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that the cat might not have been outside. This means that our assumption (the dog being inside) cannot be true.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
