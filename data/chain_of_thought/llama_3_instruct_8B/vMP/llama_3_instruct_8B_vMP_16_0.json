            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"The shirt being cotton implies the pants are denim\".\n2. The second premise is \"The shirt was cotton\". This is an assertion about the shirt's material.\n3. The conclusion is \"The pants were denim\".\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premises logically entail the conclusion.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. From the second premise, we know that the shirt is indeed cotton.\n\nUsing modus ponens (a valid logical rule), we can infer that:\n\n\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n\"The shirt was cotton\"\n\n\u2234 \"The pants were denim\"\n\nSince the premises logically entail the conclusion, this argument is logically valid.",
