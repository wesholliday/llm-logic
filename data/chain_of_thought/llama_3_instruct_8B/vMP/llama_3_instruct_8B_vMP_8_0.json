            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". This is an if-then statement, which can be rewritten as a conditional statement: If P (vampire was awake), then Q (mummy was awake).\n2. The second premise states \"The vampire was awake\". This is a categorical statement that asserts the truth of the antecedent (P) in the conditional statement.\n3. To determine if the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" follows logically from the premises, we need to apply modus ponens, which states that if P \u2192 Q and P, then Q.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n* P \u2192 Q: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (first premise)\n* P: The vampire was awake (second premise)\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\nQ: The mummy was awake\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore,\n\nAnswer: yes",
