            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement, which can be read as \"If the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true\".\n2. The second premise is \"Mary was at the wedding\". This is an assertion that Mary did indeed attend the wedding.\n3. The conclusion is \"Sue was at the wedding\", which is inferred from the first two premises.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows a valid logical form. In this case, the argument appears to be an example of modus ponens (MP), a valid logical rule:\n\nMP: If A \u2192 B and A, then B\n\nIn our argument:\n\nA = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\nB = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nThe first premise is essentially saying \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (A \u2192 B), and the second premise asserts that Mary was indeed at the wedding (A). Therefore, by modus ponens, we can logically conclude that Sue was also at the wedding (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
