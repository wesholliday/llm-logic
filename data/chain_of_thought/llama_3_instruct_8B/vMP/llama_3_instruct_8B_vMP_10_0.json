Premise 1: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\"\nThis premise states a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside.\n2. Premise 2: \"The dog was inside\"\nThis premise provides evidence that supports the antecedent (the condition) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\nNow, let's apply modus ponens to derive the conclusion:\n\nIf the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\nThe dog was inside\n\n\u2234 The cat was outside\n\nSince we have a valid application of modus ponens, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
