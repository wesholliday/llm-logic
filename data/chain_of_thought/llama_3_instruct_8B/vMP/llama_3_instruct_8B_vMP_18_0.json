            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"The doll being plastic implies the truck being metal\".\n2. The second premise is \"The doll was plastic\". This is an assertion about the doll's material.\n3. The conclusion is \"The truck was metal\". This is what we want to infer from the premises.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, can we be certain that the conclusion is true if both premises are true?\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\nFrom premise 2, we know that the doll was indeed plastic.\n\nUsing modus ponens (a valid logical rule), we can infer that:\n\nIf the doll was plastic \u2192 The truck was metal\nThe doll was plastic\n\n\u2234 The truck was metal\n\nSince our conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
