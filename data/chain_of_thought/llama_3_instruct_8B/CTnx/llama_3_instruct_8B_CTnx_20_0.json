We can rephrase this statement as:\n\n\u00ac(Fleeg is bluttered) \u2192 \u00ac(Fleeg surn)\n\nUsing the material implication rule (\u223cp \u2192 \u223cq \u2261 p \u2227 q), we can rewrite the statement as:\n\nFleeg is bluttered \u2227 Fleeg surn\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement:\n\n\"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\nWe want to know if this statement follows logically from the original one. To do so, we can rephrase the converse statement as:\n\n\u00ac(Fleeg is bluttered) \u2192 \u00ac(Fleeg surn)\n\nUsing the material implication rule again (\u223cp \u2192 \u223cq \u2261 p \u2227 q), we can rewrite the converse statement as:\n\nFleeg is bluttered \u2227 Fleeg did not surn\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. We see that they are logically equivalent, since both statements have the same antecedent (Fleeg is bluttered) and the same consequent (\u00ac(Fleeg surn)).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
