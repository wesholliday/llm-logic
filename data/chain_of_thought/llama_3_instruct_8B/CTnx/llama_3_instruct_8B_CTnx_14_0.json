This statement implies that being fleeked and snugged are mutually exclusive states for a clug.\n3. If we want to infer the converse of this statement, which is \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\", we need to ensure that the inference is logically valid.\n\nThe key insight here is that the original statement only provides information about what happens when a clug is fleeked. It doesn't provide any direct information about what happens when a clug is snugged.\n\nHowever, since being fleeked and snugged are mutually exclusive states (as implied by the original statement), we can infer that if a clug is not fleeked, it must be snugged (or vice versa).\n\nUsing this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\n\"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug snugged\" (which is equivalent to \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\")\n\nAnswer: yes",
