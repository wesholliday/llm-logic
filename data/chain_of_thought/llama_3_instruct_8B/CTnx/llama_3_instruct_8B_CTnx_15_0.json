This implies that being vroombed and being spended are mutually exclusive events.\n3. If we want to infer a new statement, we need to use the same logical structure as the original statement.\n4. The new statement would be \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\".\n5. Since being spened and being vroombed are mutually exclusive (as inferred from step 2), it is logically consistent to conclude that if the dreb was spened, then it was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
