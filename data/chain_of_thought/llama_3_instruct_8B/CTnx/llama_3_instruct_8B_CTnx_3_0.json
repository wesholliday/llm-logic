This implies that if the splat is morphed, it cannot be quanked (i.e., the two states are mutually exclusive).\n3. Now, let's consider the converse: \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\". \n4. If the splat quank, it means it is not morphed (by statement 2). \n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
