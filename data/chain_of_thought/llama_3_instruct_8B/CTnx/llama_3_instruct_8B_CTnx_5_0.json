This statement implies that if the zinger is fraggled, it cannot be smoogled at the same time.\n3. To infer the converse statement \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\", we need to consider the opposite scenario: if the zinger is smoogled.\n\n4. If the zinger is smoogled, it cannot be fraggled at the same time (by the same reasoning as in step 2).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
