This statement can be rewritten as \"Shanked \u2192 \u00acTink\" (using logical notation), which means that if the whiffle is shanked, then it does not tink.\n3. Now, we want to infer a new statement: \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n4. This statement can be rewritten as \"Tink \u2192 \u00acShanked\" (using logical notation), which means that if the whiffle tinks, then it is not shanked.\n5. To infer this new statement from the original one, we need to use a logical rule called \"contrapositive\". The contrapositive of \"Shanked \u2192 \u00acTink\" is indeed \"\u00acTink \u2192 \u00acShanked\", which is equivalent to our desired statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the whiffle tink, then it was not shanked.",
