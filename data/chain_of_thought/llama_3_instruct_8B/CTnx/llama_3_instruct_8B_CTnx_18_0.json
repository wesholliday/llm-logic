This implies that being plooked and being nugged are mutually exclusive states for the shank.\n3. If we want to infer a statement in the form of \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\", we need to ensure that it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the principle of contraposition, which states that if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"not Q implies not P\" is also true. In our case:\n\n* \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" implies \"If the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked\".\n* By contraposition, we can infer that \"If the shank was nugged, then it was not plooked\".\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
