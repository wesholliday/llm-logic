This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n\t* P (smonk was vreebled) \u2192 \u00acQ (smonk did not plagged)\n3. The implication operator (\u2192) means \"if-then\", and the negation symbol (\u00ac) means \"not\".\n4. From this statement, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then it's impossible for the smonk to have plagged.\n5. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n6. This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n\t* Q (smonk plagged) \u2192 \u00acP (smonk was not vreebled)\n7. Using the same implication operator and negation symbol, we can see that this statement is actually the converse of the original statement.\n8. Since the original statement implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then it didn't plagged, we can conclude that if the smonk did plagged, then it wasn't vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
