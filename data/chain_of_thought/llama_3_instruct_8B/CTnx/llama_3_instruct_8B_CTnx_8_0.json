The original statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\"\nThis means that if the sprocket is cranked, it cannot be daggled at the same time.\n\n2. We want to infer a new statement: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\"\n\nTo do this, we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the original statement says that if the sprocket is cranked, it's not daggled, we can infer that if the sprocket is NOT cranked, it MUST be daggled (since it can't be both).\n\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
