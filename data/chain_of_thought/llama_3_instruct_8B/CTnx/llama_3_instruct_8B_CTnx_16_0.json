This is called \"contrapositive\" reasoning.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement would be:\n\n\"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original one, as it preserves the same relationship between the antecedent and consequent.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the sneg did not sproted the frink (i.e., the negation of the original consequent), then the sneg was not crampled (i.e., the negation of the original antecedent).\n\nAnswer: yes",
