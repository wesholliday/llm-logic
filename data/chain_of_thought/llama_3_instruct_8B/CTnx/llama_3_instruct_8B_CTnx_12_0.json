This means that if the smip did lup the zoint, it must be because it was not shripped (since being shripped would prevent lupping).\n\nUsing this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\n\"If the smip lupped the zoint, then it must be because it was not shripped\"\n\nThis is equivalent to saying:\n\n\"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
