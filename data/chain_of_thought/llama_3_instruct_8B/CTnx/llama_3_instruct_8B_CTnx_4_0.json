This implies that being snurgled and being crink are mutually exclusive states for a fribble.\n3. If we assume that the original statement is true, it means that if a fribble is snurgled, it cannot be crink at the same time.\n4. Now, let's consider the converse: \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\".\n5. This statement implies that if a fribble is crink, it must have been snurgled in order to become crink (since being snurgled and being crink are mutually exclusive).\n6. However, this contradicts the original statement, which says that if a fribble is snurgled, it cannot be crink.\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
