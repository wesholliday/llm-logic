But we can't directly conclude this from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us about the relationship between \"slogged\" and \"tragged\", but it doesn't provide any information about the relationships between \"tragged\" and other states or actions. We need more information to establish a connection between \"tragged\" and \"not slogged\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the opposite statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
