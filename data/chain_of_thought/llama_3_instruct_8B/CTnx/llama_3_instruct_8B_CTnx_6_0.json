This statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, it cannot also have plopped the frink.\n3. Now, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\"\n4. This statement implies that if the grommet did plop the frink, it must not have been sploffed.\n\nNotice how this converse statement is essentially saying the opposite of what the original statement says. If the original statement says \"if A, then not B\", the converse statement says \"if B, then not A\".\n\n5. Since the converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement (i.e., they both express the same relationship between the variables), we can infer that it is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
