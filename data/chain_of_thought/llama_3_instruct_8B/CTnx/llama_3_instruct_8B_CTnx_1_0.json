This statement can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n\t* Blimmed \u2192 \u00acZargled (where \u2192 means \"implies\" and \u00ac means \"not\")\n3. Now, we want to infer a new statement: \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\".\n4. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement:\n\t* \u00acZargled \u2192 \u00acBlimmed (contrapositive of Blimmed \u2192 \u00acZargled)\n5. The contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement, so we can conclude that:\n\t* If the flugel was zargled, then it was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
