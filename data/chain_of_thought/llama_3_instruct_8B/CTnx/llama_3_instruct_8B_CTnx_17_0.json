This would give us:\n\n1. \"If the flob movated\" (new antecedent)\n2. \"then the flob was not skizzled\" (new consequent)\n\nHowever, simply swapping the clauses doesn't guarantee that the new statement is logically equivalent to the original one.\n\nTo determine if the new statement is true, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n\n* If the flob movated and it's not skizzled, then the statement \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" would be true.\n* But what if the flob movated and it IS skizzled? In this case, the original statement wouldn't apply (since it says \"if the flob was skizzled\"), but we can't conclude that the new statement is false.\n\nSince there's a possibility of the flob movating while being skizzled, which would make the new statement false, we cannot logically infer:\n\n\"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\"\n\nAnswer: no",
