This implies that being blummed and being zimmed are mutually exclusive states for a flug.\n3. If we want to infer the converse of the original statement, we need to swap the conditions: \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n4. Since being blummed and being zimmed are mutually exclusive, if the flug is zimmed, it cannot be blummed.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that if the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
