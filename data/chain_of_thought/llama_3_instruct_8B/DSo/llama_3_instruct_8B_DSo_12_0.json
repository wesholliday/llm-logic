Since we already know that the jacket is not hanging in the closet from statement (1), we can eliminate the option \"it is hanging in the closet\".\n\nThis leaves us with only one option: \"the jacket is draped over the chair\". Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
