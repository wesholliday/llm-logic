We have two statements:\n\t* \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" (Statement A)\n\t* \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\" (Statement B)\n2. Statement B is a disjunction, which means it's saying that one of two things must be true: either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\n3. Since Statement A says that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry, we can conclude that the second option (hidden in the pantry) is false.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
