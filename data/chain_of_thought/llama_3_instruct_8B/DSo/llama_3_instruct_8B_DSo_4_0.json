Since we already know from statement (1) that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, this means that the second option (\"it's playing in the bedroom\") is false.\n\nNow, since the second option is false, the first option must be true: \"Either\" implies that one of the two options must be true. Therefore, we can infer that:\n\n\"The cat is napping on the couch\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
