We have two statements:\n\t* \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\"\n\t* \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door\"\n2. From statement (2), we can infer that there are only two possible locations for the shoes: either the closet or the door.\n3. Since the shoes aren't lined up by the door (statement (1)), it means that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The shoes are in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
