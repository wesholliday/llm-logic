We have two statements:\n\t* \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\"\n\t* \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\"\n2. From statement (1), we know that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n3. Statement (2) gives us a disjunction: either the sunglasses are in her bag, or they are on her head. Since we already know from statement (1) that they're not on her head, this means that the second option is false.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the first option is true: the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
