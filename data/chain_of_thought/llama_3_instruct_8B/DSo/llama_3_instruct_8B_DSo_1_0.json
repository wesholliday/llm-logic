From the first premise, we know that Fido is not in the garden.\n3. The second premise tells us that there are only two possibilities: either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. Since we already know that Fido is not in the garden (from premise 1), this means that the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
