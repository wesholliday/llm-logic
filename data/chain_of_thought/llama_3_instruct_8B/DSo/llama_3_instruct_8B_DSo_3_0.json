The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\" gives us two possibilities for where the keys could be: either in the drawer or in the cabinet.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer, since we know they're not in the cabinet. This is because the only other possibility (the keys being in the cabinet) has been ruled out by the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
