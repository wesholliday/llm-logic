The statement implies that whenever the fribble is snurgled, it will crink.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse statement:\n\n\"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\"\n\nThis statement would imply that whenever the fribble crinks, it must have been snurgled beforehand. However, we cannot logically conclude this from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that being snurgled leads to crinking, but it doesn't provide any information about whether crinking necessarily implies being snurgled. There could be other reasons why a fribble might crink without being snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the reverse statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
