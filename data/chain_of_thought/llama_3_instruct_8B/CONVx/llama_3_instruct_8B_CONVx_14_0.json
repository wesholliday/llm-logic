However, it does not guarantee that whenever B occurs, A must have occurred first.\n\nIn other words, just because the clug snugged, we cannot conclude for certain that it was fleeked beforehand. There might be other reasons why the clug snugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of this statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
