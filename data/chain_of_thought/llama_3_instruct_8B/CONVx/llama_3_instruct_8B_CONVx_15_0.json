This statement implies that being vroombed is a sufficient condition for being spened.\n3. However, this does not imply that being spened is a necessary condition for being vroombed.\n\nIn other words, just because something is spened, it doesn't necessarily mean it was vroombed. There could be other ways to spend the dreb besides vroombing it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
