However, we can't logically conclude this from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that if the smip was shripped, it lupped the zoint. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the smip lupps the zoint. We don't know whether the smip was shripped or not in that case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the reverse statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
