The statement implies that if the flob is skizzled, it will necessarily move.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse statement:\n\n\"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled\"\n\nThis statement would imply that if the flob moves, it must have been skizzled beforehand. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only establishes a causal link between being skizzled and moving, but it does not rule out other possible causes of movement. For example, maybe there's another condition that can cause the flob to move, unrelated to being skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the reverse statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
