The statement implies that if something is bluttered, it will also be surned.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the converse:\n\n\"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\"\n\nTo determine whether this inference is valid, we need to check if the original statement provides enough information to support the converse. The original statement only implies that being bluttered causes something to be surned, but it doesn't provide any information about the reverse relationship.\n\nIn other words, just because something is surned, we can't conclude that it was necessarily bluttered. There might be other reasons why something could be surned, unrelated to being bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
