This statement implies that being cranked is a sufficient condition for being daggled.\n3. However, this does not imply that being daggled is a necessary condition for being cranked.\n\nIn other words, just because something is daggled, it doesn't mean it was necessarily cranked. There could be other ways to get the sprocket daggled besides cranking it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
