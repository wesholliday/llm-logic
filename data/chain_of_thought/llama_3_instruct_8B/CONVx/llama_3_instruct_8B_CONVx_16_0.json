It doesn't provide any direct evidence or hint about what happens when the sneg sprots the frink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether the sneg was crampled if it sprots the frink. The original statement does not establish a causal link between \"sproting the frink\" and being \"crampled\".\n\nAnswer: no",
