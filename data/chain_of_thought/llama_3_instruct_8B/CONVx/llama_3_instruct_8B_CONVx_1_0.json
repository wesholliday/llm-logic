The statement implies that if the flugel is blimmed, it will also be zargled.\n\nTo infer the converse statement:\n\n\"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed\"\n\nWe need to check if the original statement has a bi-implication relationship. A bi-implication relationship exists when both the antecedent implies the consequent and the consequent implies the antecedent.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the original statement only goes one way: \"blimmed\" implies \"zargled\", but there is no direct implication from \"zargled\" to \"blimmed\". Therefore, we cannot infer the converse statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
