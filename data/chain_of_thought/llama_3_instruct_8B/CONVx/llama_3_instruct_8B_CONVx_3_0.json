This implies that being morphed is a necessary condition for something to quank.\n3. If we reverse the direction of the implication, we get \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\".\n4. However, this reversed statement does not necessarily follow from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that being morphed implies quanking, but it doesn't tell us anything about the converse: whether quanking implies being morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" solely based on the original statement. The relationship between being morphed and quanking is not bidirectional.\n\nAnswer: no",
