The new statement is:\n\n\"If you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted, then the bloop will floosh\"\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the addition of \"and the crungle is splooted\" in the new statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement from the original one, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* The original statement only mentions \"bringle the splotch\", which means that the condition for the bloop to floosh is solely dependent on bringinging the splotch.\n* The new statement adds an additional condition (\"the crungle is splooted\") before stating that the bloop will floosh.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention anything about the crungle or its state, we cannot logically conclude that the addition of \"and the crungle is splooted\" would affect the outcome. In other words, the new statement introduces a new condition that was not present in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
