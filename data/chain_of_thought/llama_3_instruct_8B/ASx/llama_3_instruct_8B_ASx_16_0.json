In other words, whenever the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will quibble.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement:\n\n\"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble\"\n\nThis statement adds an additional condition \"the drib is flanked\" to the original condition \"the trankle is sploofed\". However, since we don't have any information about how the drib being flanked affects the relationship between the trankle and the zorple, we cannot infer that the zorple will quibble in this new scenario.\n\nIn other words, just because the trankle is sploofed doesn't necessarily mean that the zorple will quibble if the drib is also flanked. There might be some unknown factor at play that prevents the zorple from quibbling even though the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
