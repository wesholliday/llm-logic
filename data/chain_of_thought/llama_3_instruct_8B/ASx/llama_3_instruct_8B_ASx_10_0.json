The statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between two events or states.\n2. The antecedent (the condition) is \"the klank is hooped\", and the consequent (the result) is \"the wuggy will zink\".\n3. This implies that if the klank is indeed hooped, then the wuggy will zink.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional information provided: \"and the wuggy is out of zloat\". This new condition does not affect the relationship between the klank and the wuggy's zinking behavior. The original statement only mentioned the klank being hooped as a necessary condition for the wuggy to zink.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that even if the wuggy is out of zloat, it will still zink if the klank is hooped. This means that the additional condition \"the wuggy is out of zloat\" does not change the outcome.\n\nAnswer: yes",
