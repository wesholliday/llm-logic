In other words, we need to prove that:\n\nP \u2227 R \u2192 Q is logically equivalent to P \u2192 Q\n\nThis can be done by showing that:\n\n(P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q \u2192 P \u2192 Q\n\nUsing the definition of conditional statements and logical equivalences, we can derive this implication.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement from the original one.",
