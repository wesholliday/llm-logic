However, we cannot infer that this additional condition affects the consequent (result). The original statement only mentions \"the glunk snarbles\" as the necessary condition for \"the blip will be floinked\". Adding another condition does not change the relationship between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the given one. The additional condition (\"the troon is zibbled\") introduces a new variable that is not related to the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
