However, this new condition does not affect the causal relationship between the presence of the krimp in the zool and the resulting action of the snarf being glonked.\n\nIn other words, even if the zool is zapped, the presence of the krimp in the zool still implies that the snarf will be glonked. The new condition only provides additional information about the state of the zool, but it does not change the underlying causal relationship.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement:\n\nAnswer: yes",
