We can add this to our logical form as:\n\n\u2200x (Snark(x) \u2227 Blimmed(x) \u2227 Sproinged(x) \u2192 Flooped(x))\n\nThis means that for all x, if x is a snark and x is blimmed and x is sproinged, then x is flooped.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions \"blimmed\" as a condition for \"flooped\", we cannot infer that \"sproinged\" is also necessary for \"flooped\". Therefore:\n\nAnswer: no",
