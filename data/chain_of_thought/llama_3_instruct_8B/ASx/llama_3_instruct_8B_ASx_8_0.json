The consequent is \"it will tizzle\".\n\nNow, let's consider the additional condition \"and it was misglommed\". We need to determine whether this new information allows us to infer the original conclusion.\n\nThe key insight here is that the additional condition \"and it was misglommed\" does not contradict or modify the antecedent \"the plink has morphed\". The antecedent remains unchanged, and the consequent \"it will tizzle\" still follows logically from the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the additional condition \"and it was misglommed\" does not affect the validity of the original statement. We can still infer that if the plink has morphed (regardless of whether it was misglommed or not), then it will tizzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
