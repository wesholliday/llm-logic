In other words, whenever the plim is grobbled, the whiffle will always sploosh.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement:\n\n\"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh\"\n\nThis statement adds an additional condition \"the drazzle is drooped\" to the original condition \"the plim is grobbled\". However, since we don't have any information about how the drazzle being drooped affects the relationship between the plim being grobbled and the whiffle splooshing, we cannot infer that the new statement follows logically from the original one.\n\nIn other words, just because the plim is grobbled doesn't necessarily mean that the whiffle will sploosh if the drazzle is also drooped. There could be some unknown factor at play that affects the outcome.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
