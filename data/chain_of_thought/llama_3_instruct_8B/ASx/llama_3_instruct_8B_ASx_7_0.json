In other words, there is a direct causal relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional condition \"the plink light is out\". This new information does not provide any additional insight into the relationship between the tizzer and the goom. The original statement only mentioned the tizzer being on, not its interaction with the plink light.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled. The presence or absence of the plink light does not affect the relationship between the tizzer and the goom.\n\nAnswer: no",
