We are given two statements:\n\t* \"The griffin was in the forest\"\n\t* \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequence (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n3. We are told that the condition \"The griffin was in the forest\" is indeed true, since we have evidence for this from the first statement.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence \"The unicorn was in the forest\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
