The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n3. We know that the first statement (\"The alien visited Mars\") is true, since we're given this information as part of the question.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to our known fact: if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n5. Since the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is indeed true, we can conclude that the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
