We are given two statements:\n\t* \"Alex finished the race\" (premise)\n\t* \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (conditional statement)\n2. The conditional statement implies that if a certain condition is met (in this case, Alex finishing the race), then another event will occur (Chris finishing the race).\n3. We are told that the condition is indeed met, as stated in the premise \"Alex finished the race\".\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
