We have two statements:\n\t* \"The book was written by James\"\n\t* \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n3. We can combine the two statements to get: \"The book was written by James \u2192 The book is a mystery novel\"\n4. This conditional statement tells us that if we know the book was written by James, then we can conclude that it's a mystery novel.\n5. However, this does not mean that we can conclude the book is a mystery novel without knowing who wrote it.\n\nSo, based on these steps, I would say:\n\nAnswer: yes",
