The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. We are given evidence that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is indeed true, as stated in the first statement.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation: if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (according to the second statement).\n5. Since we know Joe did go to the park, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
