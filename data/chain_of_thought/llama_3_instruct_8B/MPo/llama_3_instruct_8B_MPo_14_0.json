We have two statements:\n\t* \"The bear was in the cave\" (premise)\n\t* \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (conditional statement)\n2. The conditional statement implies that if a certain condition is met (the bear being in the cave), then a specific consequence will follow (the wolf being in the den).\n3. We know that the condition is indeed met, as stated in the premise \"The bear was in the cave\".\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n5. Since we already know that the bear was in the cave (from the premise), we can infer that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
