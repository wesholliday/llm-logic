The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that the first statement \"The vampire was awake\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer that the consequence \"The mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
