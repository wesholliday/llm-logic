The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n3. We are told that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is indeed true, since we have evidence for this in the first statement.\n4. Therefore, by applying the conditional statement, we can conclude that the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
