We have two statements:\n\t* \"The car was red\" (premise)\n\t* \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (conditional statement)\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the antecedent (\"the car was red\") is true, then the consequent (\"the truck was blue\") must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The car was red\" is indeed true (from the premise), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If the car was red, then the truck was blue\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
