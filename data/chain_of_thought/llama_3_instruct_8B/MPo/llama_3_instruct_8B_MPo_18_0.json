The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n3. We are told that the condition \"The doll was plastic\" is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence \"The truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
