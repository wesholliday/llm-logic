The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n3. We are given evidence that the condition is indeed true: Mary was at the wedding.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence must also be true: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
