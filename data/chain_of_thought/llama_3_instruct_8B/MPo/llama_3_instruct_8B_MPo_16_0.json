The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (in this case, \"the shirt was cotton\") is true.\n3. Since we know that \"The shirt was cotton\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer something about the pants.\n4. According to the conditional statement, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Since we've established that the shirt was cotton, we can conclude that...\n5. ...the pants must have been denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
