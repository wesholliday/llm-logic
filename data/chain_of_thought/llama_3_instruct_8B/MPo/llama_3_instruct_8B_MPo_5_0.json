This statement is combined with another statement, which is an if-then statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\".\n3. The if-then statement implies that there is a causal relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n4. Since we know that Jeff did play basketball (from step 1), we can apply the if-then statement to conclude that Amy must have played tennis as well.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes",
