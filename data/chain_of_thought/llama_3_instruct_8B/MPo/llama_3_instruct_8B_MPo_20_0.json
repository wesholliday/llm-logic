The hypothesis is a conditional statement, which means it has a condition (the apple being red) and a consequence (the banana being yellow).\n3. Since we know that the apple was indeed red (from the premise), we can apply the hypothesis to this specific situation.\n4. According to the hypothesis, if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the banana is indeed yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
