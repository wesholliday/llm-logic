The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that \"Sue chose pizza\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that:\n\t* If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Bob did choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
