The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n3. We are told that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is indeed true, since we know this from the first statement.\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, we can infer that the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
