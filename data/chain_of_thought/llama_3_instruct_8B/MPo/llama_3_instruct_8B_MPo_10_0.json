The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n3. We know that the first statement (\"The dog was inside\") is indeed true.\n4. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to our known fact: \"If the dog was inside\" is true, so \"then the cat was outside\" must also be true.\n5. This means we can infer that the cat was indeed outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
