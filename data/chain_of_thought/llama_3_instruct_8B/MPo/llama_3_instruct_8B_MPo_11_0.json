The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (in this case, \"the cake was chocolate\") is true.\n3. Since we know that \"The cake was chocolate\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer something about the muffins.\n4. According to the conditional statement, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n5. Since we've established that the cake was indeed chocolate, we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is met.\n6. Therefore, we can apply the conclusion of the conditional statement: \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
