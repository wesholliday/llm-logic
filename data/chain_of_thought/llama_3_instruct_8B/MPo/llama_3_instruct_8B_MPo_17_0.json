The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n3. We know that the condition (\"Ben ate pasta\") is indeed true, since we have evidence for it in the first statement.\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, we can infer that the consequence (\"Kate ate the salad\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
