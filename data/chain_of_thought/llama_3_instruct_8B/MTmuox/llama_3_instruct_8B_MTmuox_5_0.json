We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled\" (\u00ac(Z \u2192 S))\n\t* \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\" (F \u2192 Z)\n\n2. We want to infer whether the zinger was not fraggled (\u00acF).\n\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens, which states that if P implies Q, and it's not the case that Q, then it's not the case that P.\n\n4. In our case, P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" (F), and Q is \"the zinger must have been smoogled\" (Z).\n\n5. We can rewrite the given statements as:\n\t* \u00ac(F \u2192 Z) (from the first statement)\n\t* F \u2192 Z (from the second statement)\n\n6. Now, we can apply modus tollens to get:\n\t* \u00ac(F \u2192 Z) \u2283 \u00acF\n\n7. Since we know that F \u2192 Z is true (from the second statement), we can substitute it into the above equation to get:\n\t* \u00ac(Z) \u2283 \u00acF\n\n8. Finally, we can conclude that if it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled (\u00acZ), then it's not the case that the zinger was fraggled (\u00acF).\n\nAnswer: yes",
