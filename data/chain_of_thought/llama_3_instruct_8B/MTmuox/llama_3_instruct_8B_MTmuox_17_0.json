The second statement says \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved\". This is a conditional statement.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the flob's movement is not necessary (it didn't necessarily move).\n4. However, the second statement only talks about what happens if the flob was skizzled. It doesn't say anything about what happens if it wasn't skizzled.\n5. Therefore, we can't conclude that the flob was not skizzled just because it didn't necessarily move.\n\nAnswer: no",
