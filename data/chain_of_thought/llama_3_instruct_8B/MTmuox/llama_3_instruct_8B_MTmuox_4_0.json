            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\" (\u00acC)\n\t* \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" (S \u2192 C)\n\n2. We want to infer whether \"The fribble was not snurgled\" is true or false.\n\n3. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement: \u00acC \u2192 \u00acS\n\n4. This means that if it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked (\u00acC), then it's not the case that the fribble was snurgled (\u00acS).\n\n5. Since we know that \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\" is true (\u00acC), we can conclude that \u00acS is also true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
