To do this, we need to use the given statements and some logical rules.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that \u00acV. We can't directly conclude \u00acP from this statement alone.\n\nHowever, if we combine statement 2 with statement 1, we get:\n\n\u00acV \u2192 P \u2192 V (using the contrapositive of the conditional statement)\n\nThis implies that if the twonk was not varnished (\u00acV), then it must have been plinked (P). This is because the original conditional statement P \u2192 V implies that if P is true, then V must be true. By taking the contrapositive, we get \u00acV \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, combining this result with statement 1, we can conclude:\n\n\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis means that if it's not the case that the twonk was varnished (\u00acV), then it's also not the case that the twonk was plinked (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
