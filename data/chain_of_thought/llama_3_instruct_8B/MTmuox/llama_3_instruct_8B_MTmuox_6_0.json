We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\" (\u00acP)\n\t* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\" (Q \u2192 P)\n\n2. We want to infer whether the grommet was not sploffed (\u00acQ).\n\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens: if Q \u2192 P and \u00acP, then \u00acQ.\n\n4. In our case, Q \u2192 P is given, and \u00acP is also given. Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude that \u00acQ.\n\n5. Hence, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed (\u00acQ).\n\nAnswer: yes",
