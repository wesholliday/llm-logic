The second statement says \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\". This is a conditional statement.\n3. Since we know the antecedent (the condition) is false (\"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\"), we can conclude that the consequent (what follows if the condition is true) is also false.\n\nSo, if the splat did not quank, and it would have quanked only if it was morphed, then it's reasonable to infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
