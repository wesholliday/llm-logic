This means that it is possible for the flug to not be zimmed.\n2. The second statement is an if-then statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\". This implies that if the flug is blummed, then it must also be zimmed.\n3. We are trying to infer whether the flug was not blummed (i.e., \u00acblummed). To do this, we need to consider the possible combinations of states for the flug:\n\t* If the flug is blummed and zimmed, then it satisfies both conditions in the if-then statement.\n\t* If the flug is blummed but not zimmed, then it does not satisfy the condition \"the flug must have been zimmed\", which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, this combination is impossible.\n\t* If the flug is not blummed and notzimmed, then it satisfies neither condition in the if-then statement.\n\nFrom step 1, we know that it's possible for the flug to not be zimmed. This means that one of the two remaining possibilities must be true: either the flug is not blummed or it is blummed but notzimmed.\n\nSince we cannot determine which of these two possibilities is true based on the given information, we cannot infer whether the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
