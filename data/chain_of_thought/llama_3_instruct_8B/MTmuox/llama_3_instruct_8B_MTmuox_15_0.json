We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened (\u00acMustHaveBeenSpended)\n\t* If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened (Vroombed \u2192 MustHaveBeenSpended)\n2. We want to infer whether The dreb was not vroombed (\u00acVroombed).\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n4. In our case, P = Vroombed and Q = MustHaveBeenSpended.\n5. We are given \u00acMustHaveBeenSpended (from statement 1).\n6. Using modus tollens, we can infer \u00acVroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
