We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled (\u00acZ)\n\t* If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled (B \u2192 Z)\n\n2. We want to infer whether the flugel was not blimmed (\u00acB).\n\n3. To do this, we can use the first statement: \u00acZ. This tells us that it's not possible for the flugel to be zargled.\n\n4. Now, let's look at the second statement: B \u2192 Z. This is a conditional statement saying that if the flugel was blimmed (B), then it must have been zargled (Z).\n\n5. Since we know \u00acZ (it's not possible for the flugel to be zargled), we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (B) is false.\n\n6. Therefore, the flugel was not blimmed (\u00acB).\n\nAnswer: yes",
