This doesn't give us any information about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. But this doesn't tell us anything about whether the fleeg was actually bluttered or not.\n\nSince neither of these statements gives us any information about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
