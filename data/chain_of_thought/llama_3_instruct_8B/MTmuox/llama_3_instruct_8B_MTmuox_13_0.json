We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged\" (\u00ac(G \u2192 T))\n\t* \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\" (S \u2192 G)\n2. We want to infer whether \"The glip was not slogged\" (\u00acS) is true.\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens: if we assume \u00acS and show that it leads to a contradiction, then we can conclude that \u00acS is false, which means S must be true.\n\nLet's try to derive a contradiction from the assumption \u00acS:\n\nAssume \u00acS (The glip was not slogged)\nFrom the given statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\" (S \u2192 G), we can infer:\n\u00acS \u2192 \u00acG (The glip was not slogged implies the glip did not trag)\n\nNow, combine the two statements:\n\n\u00ac(G \u2192 T) \u2227 \u00acS \u2192 \u00acG\n\nThis is a contradiction, since it says that the glip must have tragged (G \u2192 T) and also didn't trag (\u00acG). This is impossible.\n\nTherefore, our assumption \u00acS was incorrect. We can conclude that S must be true:\n\nAnswer: no",
