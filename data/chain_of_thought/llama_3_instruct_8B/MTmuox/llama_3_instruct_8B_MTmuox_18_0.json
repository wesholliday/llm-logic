We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\n\t* If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the shank does not necessarily need to be nugged. This means that there is a possibility that the shank was not nugged.\n\n3. The second statement says that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. This implies that being plooked and being nugged are related in some way.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the conclusion we want to infer: \"The shank was not plooked\".\n\n5. If the shank was not plooked, then it doesn't matter whether it was nugged or not (since the first statement tells us that being nugged is not necessary). Therefore, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
