We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (\u00ac(S \u2192 F))\n\t* \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (C \u2192 S \u2192 F)\n2. We want to infer whether the sneg was not crampled (\u00acC).\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens: if we assume \u00acC and show that it leads to a contradiction, then we can conclude that \u00acC is false.\n4. Let's try assuming \u00acC:\n\t* If \u00acC, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\t* From the second statement, we know that if the sneg was crampled (C), then it must have sproted the frink (S \u2192 F).\n\t* But since we assumed \u00acC, the sneg was not crampled. Therefore, it cannot be the case that it sproted the frink.\n5. Now, let's combine this with the first statement: \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (\u00ac(S \u2192 F)).\n\t* Since we just showed that the sneg did not sproted the frink (\u00acS \u2192 F), and \u00ac(S \u2192 F) is true, it follows that S \u2192 F is false.\n6. From this, we can conclude that the sneg was crampled (C). If it wasn't crampled, then it would have to sproted the frink, but we just showed that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
