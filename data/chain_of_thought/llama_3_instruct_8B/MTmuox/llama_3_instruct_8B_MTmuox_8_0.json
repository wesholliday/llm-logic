We are given two statements:\n\t* It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled (\u00acD)\n\t* If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled (C \u2192 D)\n\n2. We want to infer whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\n3. From statement 1, we know that it's not necessary for the sprocket to be daggled (\u00acD). This means that there might be a scenario where the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the second statement: C \u2192 D. This implies that if the sprocket was cranked (C), then it must have been daggled (D).\n\n5. Since we know that \u00acD (it's not necessary for the sprocket to be daggled), and C \u2192 D, we can conclude that C is false.\n\n6. Therefore, the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
