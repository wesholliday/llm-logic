We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint\" (\u00ac(Wug must have bimmed the zoint))\n\t* \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\" (If Wug is flooped, then Wug must have bimmed the zoint)\n2. We want to infer whether the wug was not flooped (\u00acWug is flooped).\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens, which states that if a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must be false.\n4. In our case, the second statement says \"If Wug is flooped, then Wug must have bimmed the zoint\". If we assume Wug was not flooped (\u00acWug is flooped), then the antecedent of this conditional would be false, and by modus tollens, the consequent would also be false. But the consequent says \"Wug must have bimmed the zoint\", which contradicts the first statement \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint\".\n5. Therefore, our assumption \u00acWug is flooped cannot be true. This means Wug must have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: no",
