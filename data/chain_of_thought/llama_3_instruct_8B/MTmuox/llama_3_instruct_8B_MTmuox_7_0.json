We are given two statements:\n\t* \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked\" (\u00acT)\n\t* \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked\" (S \u2192 T)\n\n2. We want to infer whether the whiffle was not shanked (\u00acS).\n\n3. To do this, we can use modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\n4. In our case, P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" (S) and Q is \"the whiffle must have tinked\" (T).\n\n5. We are given \u00acT, which means the whiffle did not tinker.\n\n6. Using modus tollens, we can conclude that if S \u2192 T and \u00acT, then \u00acS.\n\n7. Plugging in our values, we get: \"If the whiffle was shanked (S) then it must have tinked (T)\" and \"it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked\" (\u00acT).\n\n8. Therefore, using modus tollens again, we can conclude that \u00acS, which means the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
