The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement (1). It says \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled\". Since we already know from statement (2) that the zinger is not smoogled, we can conclude that the first option (\"the zinger is fraggled\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
