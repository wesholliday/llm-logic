The fleeg is not surned.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the fleeg is not surned. This means that the only possibility left is that the fleeg is bluttered, since it cannot be both bluttered and surned at the same time (due to the \"either-or\" condition in statement (1)).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg is indeed bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
