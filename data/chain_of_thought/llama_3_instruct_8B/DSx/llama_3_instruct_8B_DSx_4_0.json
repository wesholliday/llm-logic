Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked (This statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the state of the fribble: either it's snurgled or it's crinked.)\n2. The fribble is not crinked (This statement is telling us that one of the possible states mentioned in statement 1 is not true, which means the fribble cannot be crinked.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the fribble is not crinked, we can conclude that it must be snurgled. This is because statement 1 says there are only two possibilities (snurgled or crinked), and statement 2 rules out the possibility of being crinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
