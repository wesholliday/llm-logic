The glip is not tragged.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the glip is not tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement (1). It says \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged\". This means that there are two possibilities: either the glip is slogged, or it is tragged. But we already know from statement (2) that the glip is not tragged.\n\nSo, if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. This is because statement (1) says \"Either... or\", and since one of those options (\"it is tragged\") has been eliminated, the other option (\"it is slogged\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that The glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
