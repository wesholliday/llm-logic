The clug is not snugged.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement (1). It says \"Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged\". This means that there are two possibilities: either the clug is fleeked, or it is snugged. But we already know from statement (2) that the clug is not snugged.\n\nTherefore, since one of the options in statement (1) has been ruled out (the clug being snugged), we can conclude that the other option must be true: the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
