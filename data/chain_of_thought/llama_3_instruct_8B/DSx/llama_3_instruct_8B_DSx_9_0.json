The twonk is not plinked (N)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement 1: \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished\". This is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since we already know from statement 2 that the twonk is not plinked, this means that the only remaining option is:\n\nThe twonk is varnished\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is indeed varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
