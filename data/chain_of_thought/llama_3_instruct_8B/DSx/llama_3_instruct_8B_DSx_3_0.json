The splat is not quanked.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement (1). It says \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\". This means that there are two possibilities: either the splat is morphed, or it is quanked. But we already know from statement (2) that the splat is not quanked.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
