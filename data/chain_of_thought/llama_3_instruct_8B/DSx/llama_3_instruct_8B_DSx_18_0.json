The shank is not nugged.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the shank is not nugged. This means that the only possibility left is that the shank is plooked, since statement (1) states that either the shank is plooked or it is nugged, and we've already eliminated the latter option.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank is indeed plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
