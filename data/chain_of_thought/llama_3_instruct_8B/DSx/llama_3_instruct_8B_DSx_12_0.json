Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped (This statement is saying that there are only two possibilities for the state of the smip: either it is shripped or it is lupped.)\n2. The smip is not lupped (This statement is providing additional information, which is that the smip is not in the state of being lupped.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities for the state of the smip: either it is shripped or it is lupped.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the smip is not lupped. This means that the possibility of the smip being lupped has been eliminated.\n\nSince the smip cannot be both shripped and lupped at the same time (due to statement 1), and we have already eliminated the possibility of it being lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
