The grommet is not plopped.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the grommet is not plopped. This means that the only possibility left is that the grommet is indeed sploffed, since statement (1) states that either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped, and we've already eliminated the latter option.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
