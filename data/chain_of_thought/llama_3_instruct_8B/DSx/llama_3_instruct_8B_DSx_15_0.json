The dreb is not spened.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that the dreb is not spened. This means that the only possibility left is that the dreb is indeed vroombed, since statement (1) states that either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened, and we've already eliminated the latter option.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
