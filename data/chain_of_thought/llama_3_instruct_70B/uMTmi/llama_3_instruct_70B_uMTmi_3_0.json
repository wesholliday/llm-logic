This implies that if James wrote the book, it is necessarily a mystery novel.\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel. This means we don't know for sure whether the book is a mystery novel or not.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the book was written by James or not:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (from statement 1). But we know that the book might not be a mystery novel (from statement 2). This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book was not written by James, because it's possible that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nIn other words, we can't infer with certainty that the book was not written by James based on the given information. There are two possibilities: either the book is a mystery novel and was written by James, or it's not a mystery novel and wasn't written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
