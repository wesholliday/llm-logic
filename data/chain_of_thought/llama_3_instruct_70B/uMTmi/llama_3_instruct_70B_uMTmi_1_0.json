            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This implies a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue: if Mary is present, then Sue is also present.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding. This statement introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sue was not at the wedding (as suggested by statement 2), it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary wasn't at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue wasn't present, unrelated to Mary's attendance.\n\nHowever, if Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 1, Sue must have been at the wedding as well. But we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding (statement 2). This creates a contradiction: if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue should be at the wedding too, but we're told that Sue might not have been.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that our initial assumption - \"Mary was at the wedding\" - must be false. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
