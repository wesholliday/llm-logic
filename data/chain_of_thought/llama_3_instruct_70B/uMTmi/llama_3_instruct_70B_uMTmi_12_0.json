            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This suggests that it's possible Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements together:\n\nIf Lucy didn't go to the zoo (as stated in 2), then we can infer that Joe didn't go to the park. Why? Because if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (according to statement 1). But since Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it means Joe couldn't have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
