This implies that if Sam took a plane, we can be certain that Erin took a train.\n2. Erin might not have taken a train. This means that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then according to statement 1, Erin must have taken a train. But statement 2 says that Erin might not have taken a train, which contradicts the conclusion we drew from statement 1. This contradiction arises because if Sam took a plane, it would imply that Erin definitely took a train, but statement 2 suggests that Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nThis inconsistency leads us to question our initial assumption: \"Sam took a plane.\" Since this assumption leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the assumption is likely false. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
