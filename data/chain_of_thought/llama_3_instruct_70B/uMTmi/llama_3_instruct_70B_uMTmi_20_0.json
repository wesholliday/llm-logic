This implies a conditional relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow.\n\n2. The banana might not have been yellow. This statement introduces uncertainty about the color of the banana.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the apple was indeed red, then according to the first statement, the banana must have been yellow. However, the second statement suggests that the banana might not have been yellow, which contradicts the conclusion drawn from the first statement.\n\nThis contradiction implies that our initial assumption - \"the apple was red\" - cannot be true. If it were true, we would expect the banana to be yellow, but since the banana might not have been yellow, the apple cannot have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
