This implies a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta.\n2. Bob might not have chosen pasta. This statement introduces uncertainty about Bob's choice.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sue had chosen pizza, then according to the first statement, Bob would have chosen pasta. However, we know that Bob might not have chosen pasta (from the second statement). This creates a contradiction, as if Sue chose pizza, Bob should have chosen pasta, but we're told he might not have.\n\nThis contradiction arises because of the assumption that Sue chose pizza. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
