If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nThis implies that if Alex finished, Chris definitely finished.\n\n2. Chris might not have finished the race.\nThis means that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze these two statements together:\nIf Alex finished, Chris would have finished (from statement 1). But we know that Chris might not have finished (from statement 2). This implies that Alex cannot have finished the race, because if Alex had finished, Chris would have finished too, which contradicts the possibility of Chris not finishing.\n\nAnswer: yes",
