(Given)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. But from statement 2, we know that the truck might not be metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal (by statement 1). But this contradicts statement 2, which says the truck might not be metal.\n* If the doll is not plastic, then we can't conclude anything about the truck being metal or not.\n\nSince we have a contradiction when assuming the doll is plastic, it's possible that the doll is not plastic. However, we can't definitively conclude that the doll was not plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
