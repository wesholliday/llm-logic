            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This statement introduces uncertainty about Mark's purchase.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the first statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (from the second statement). This creates a contradiction, as Mark both must and might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt in the first place. If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then the conditional relationship between her buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt doesn't apply, and we can't infer anything about Mark's purchase.\n\nAnswer: yes",
