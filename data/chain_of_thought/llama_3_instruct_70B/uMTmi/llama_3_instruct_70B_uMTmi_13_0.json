However, we know that the truck might not have been blue (from the second statement). This creates a contradiction, as the truck cannot be both blue and not blue at the same time.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need to revisit our assumption about the car being red. Since the truck can't be both blue and not blue, it's possible that our initial assumption about the car being red is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
