This implies a conditional relationship between the two statements: if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\n2. The muffins might not have been blueberry. This statement introduces uncertainty about the type of muffins.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cake was indeed chocolate, then according to the first statement, the muffins must be blueberry. However, the second statement suggests that the muffins might not be blueberry, which contradicts the conclusion drawn from the first statement.\n\nThis contradiction implies that our initial assumption - \"the cake was chocolate\" - cannot be true. If it were true, we would have a logical inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning:\n\nAnswer: yes",
