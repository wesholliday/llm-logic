(Given)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are definitely denim.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's possible the pants are not denim.\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if the shirt was indeed cotton:\n\n* If the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim (from statement 1).\n* But we know the pants might not have been denim (from statement 2).\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants should be denim, but we're told it's possible they're not denim.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the shirt is cotton must be false. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
