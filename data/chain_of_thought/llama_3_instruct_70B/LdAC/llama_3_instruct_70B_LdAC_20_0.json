The banana was yellow (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the banana is yellow, the apple must be red.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the implication in one direction: from \"apple is red\" to \"banana is yellow\". It does not guarantee the reverse implication: from \"banana is yellow\" to \"apple is red\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that \"The apple was red\" simply because the banana is yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
