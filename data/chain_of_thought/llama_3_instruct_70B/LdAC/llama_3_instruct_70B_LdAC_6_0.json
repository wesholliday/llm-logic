Bob chose pasta (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequence is true but the condition is unknown or false.\n\nGiven only these two statements, we cannot logically deduce that Sue chose pizza simply because Bob chose pasta. There might be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, and we don't have enough information to conclude that Sue's choice of pizza was the cause.\n\nAnswer: no",
