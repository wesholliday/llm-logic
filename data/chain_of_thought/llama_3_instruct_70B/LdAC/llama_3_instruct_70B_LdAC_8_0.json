The mummy was awake (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will be awake, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the mummy is awake and the vampire's state is unknown.\n\nGiven only these two statements, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake. The mummy being awake could be due to other reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: no",
