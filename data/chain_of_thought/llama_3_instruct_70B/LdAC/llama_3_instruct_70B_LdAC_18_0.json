The truck was metal (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the truth of the consequent (the truck being metal) if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true. It does not provide any information about the antecedent being true if the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"The doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: no",
