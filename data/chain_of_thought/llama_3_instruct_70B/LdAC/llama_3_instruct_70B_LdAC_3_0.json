The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the book is a mystery novel, it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nStatement 2 only tells us that the book is a mystery novel, but it doesn't provide any information about the author.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"The book was written by James\" solely based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
