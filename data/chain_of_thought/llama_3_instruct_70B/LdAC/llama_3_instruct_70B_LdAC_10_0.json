The cat was outside (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the direction \"inside dog\" \u2192 \"outside cat\", but it does not guarantee the reverse direction \"outside cat\" \u2192 \"inside dog\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that the dog was inside simply because the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
