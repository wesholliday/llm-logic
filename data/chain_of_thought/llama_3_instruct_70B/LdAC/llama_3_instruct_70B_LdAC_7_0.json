If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (implies that if Alex finished, Chris must have finished too)\n2. Chris finished the race\n\nNow, we want to know if we can logically deduce \"Alex finished the race\" from these two statements.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Chris finished the race. But this doesn't necessarily mean Alex finished the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, unrelated to Alex's performance.\n\nThe first statement only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished too. It does not provide any information about what happens when Chris finishes the race. In other words, it does not imply that if Chris finished, then Alex must have finished too.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Alex finished the race\" from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
