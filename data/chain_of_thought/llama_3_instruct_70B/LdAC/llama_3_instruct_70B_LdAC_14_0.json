The wolf was in the den (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the wolf is in the den, then the bear must be in the cave.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the presence of the wolf in the den if the bear is in the cave, but it does not guarantee the presence of the bear in the cave if the wolf is in the den.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that \"The bear was in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: no",
