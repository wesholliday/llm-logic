The robot visited Jupiter (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" is true, then the consequent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\nHowever, just because we know the consequent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is true (from statement 2), it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" is true. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We cannot logically deduce that the alien visited Mars solely based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
