Erin took a train (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequence is true but the condition is unknown or false.\n\nGiven that Erin took a train (statement 2), we can't logically conclude that Sam must have taken a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam's actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided statements, we cannot logically deduce that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
