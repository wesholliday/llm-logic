This implies that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n2. To infer the opposite, we need to consider what would be the case if the fribble must have been snurgled. If it must have been snurgled, then it cannot be the case that it might not have been snurgled (because \"must\" implies a necessity, whereas \"might not\" implies a possibility).\n3. Since the original statement asserts that the fribble might not have been snurgled, we can conclude that it's not necessarily the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
