            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\". This implies that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" follows from this statement.\n3. The phrase \"It's not the case that\" is equivalent to negating the sentence that follows. So, we can rephrase the inference as \"Is it true that the smonk must not have been vreebled?\"\n4. If the smonk might not have been vreebled (original statement), then it cannot be the case that the smonk must have been vreebled. This is because \"might not\" implies uncertainty or possibility, whereas \"must have\" implies necessity.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that if the smonk might not have been vreebled, then it's indeed not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
