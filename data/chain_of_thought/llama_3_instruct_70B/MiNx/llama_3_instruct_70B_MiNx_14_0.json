This implies that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been fleeked\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been fleeked\" implies a possibility of non-fleeking.\n4. If it's possible that the clug was not fleeked (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the clug must have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
