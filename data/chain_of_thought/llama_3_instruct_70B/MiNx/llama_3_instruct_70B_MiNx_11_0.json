This implies that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed.\n2. To infer the opposite, we need to consider what would be the case if the flug must have been blummed. If it must have been blummed, then it cannot be the case that it might not have been blummed (because \"must\" implies a certainty, whereas \"might not\" implies uncertainty).\n3. Since the original statement asserts that the flug might not have been blummed, we can conclude that it's not the case that the flug must have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
