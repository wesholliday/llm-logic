This implies that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been\" implies a sense of necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been\" implies a lack of necessity or possibility.\n4. If it's possible that the sneg was not crampled (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the sneg must have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
