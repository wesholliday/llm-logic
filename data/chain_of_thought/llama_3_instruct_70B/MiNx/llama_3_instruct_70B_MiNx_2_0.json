This implies that there is a possibility that the wug was not flooped.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been flooped\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been flooped\" implies a possibility of non-flooping.\n4. If it's possible that the wug was not flooped (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the wug must have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
