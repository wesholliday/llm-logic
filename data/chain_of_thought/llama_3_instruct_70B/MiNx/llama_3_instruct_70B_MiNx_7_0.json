This implies that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been shanked\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been shanked\" implies a possibility of not being shanked.\n4. If it's possible that the whiffle was not shanked (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
