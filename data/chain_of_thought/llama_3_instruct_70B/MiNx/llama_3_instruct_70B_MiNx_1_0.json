This implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n2. To infer the opposite, we need to consider what would be the case if the flugel must have been blimmed. If it must have been blimmed, then it cannot be the case that it might not have been blimmed (because \"must\" implies a certainty).\n3. Since the original statement says \"might not\", which implies uncertainty or possibility, it contradicts the idea of \"must\".\n4. Therefore, if the flugel might not have been blimmed, then it's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
