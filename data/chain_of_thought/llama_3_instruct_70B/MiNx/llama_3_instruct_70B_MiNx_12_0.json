This implies that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been shripped\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been shripped\" implies a possibility of non-occurrence.\n4. If something might not have happened, it means that it's possible for it to not have happened. This contradicts the idea that it must have happened (i.e., there is no possibility of it not happening).\n5. Therefore, if \"The smip might not have been shripped\" is true, then it cannot be the case that \"the smip must have been shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
