This implies that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" follows from this.\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider what \"must have been morphed\" means. It implies a necessity or obligation that the splat was morphed.\n\nNow, if we say \"The splat might not have been morphed\", it means that there is no such necessity or obligation. In other words, it's possible that the splat wasn't morphed.\n\nThis lack of necessity or obligation implies that it's not the case that the splat must have been morphed. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" follows from \"The splat might not have been morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
