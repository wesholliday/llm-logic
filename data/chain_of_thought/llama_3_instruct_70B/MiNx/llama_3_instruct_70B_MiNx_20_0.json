This implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n2. To infer the opposite, we need to consider what would be the case if the fleeg must have been bluttered. If it must have been bluttered, then it cannot be the case that it might not have been bluttered (because \"must\" implies a necessity, whereas \"might not\" implies a possibility).\n3. Since the original statement asserts that the fleeg might not have been bluttered, we can conclude that it's not necessarily the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
