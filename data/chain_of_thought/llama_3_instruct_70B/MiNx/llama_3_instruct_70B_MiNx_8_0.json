This implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been cranked\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been cranked\" implies a possibility of non-crankedness.\n4. If it's possible that the sprocket was not cranked (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the sprocket must have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
