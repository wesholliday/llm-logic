This implies that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been skizzled\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been skizzled\" implies a possibility of non-skizzling.\n4. If it's possible that the flob was not skizzled (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
