This implies that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been slogged\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been slogged\" implies a possibility of non-slogness.\n4. If it's possible that the glip was not slogged (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the glip must have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
