This implies that there is a possibility that the wug was not sproinged.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must have been sproinged\" implies a necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not have been sproinged\" implies a possibility of non-sproingement.\n4. If it's possible that the wug was not sproinged (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the wug must have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
