The mummy was awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the mummy was indeed awake. However, we can't conclude from this alone that the vampire was awake. The mummy being awake only confirms one half of the implication in statement 1, but it doesn't provide any direct information about the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
