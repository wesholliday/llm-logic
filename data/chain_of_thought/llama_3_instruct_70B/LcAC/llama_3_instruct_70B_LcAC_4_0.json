The robot visited Jupiter (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" is true, then the consequent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are not given any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. All we know is that the robot visited Jupiter (statement 2).\n\nJust because the consequent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" is also true. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The alien visited Mars\".\n\nAnswer: no",
