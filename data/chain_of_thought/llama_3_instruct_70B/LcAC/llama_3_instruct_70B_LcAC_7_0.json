Chris finished the race (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Chris finished the race, but it doesn't provide any direct information about Alex's status.\n\nNow, let's try to conclude whether Alex finished the race or not. We know that Chris finished the race, but we don't have enough information to determine whether Alex finished the race or not. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris would have finished, but it doesn't work in reverse.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
