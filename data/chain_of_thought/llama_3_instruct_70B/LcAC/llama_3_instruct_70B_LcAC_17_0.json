Kate ate salad (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if Kate ate salad, then Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate eating salad) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequence is true but the condition is unknown or false.\n\nSince we are only given that Kate ate salad, we cannot logically conclude that Ben ate pasta. There might be other reasons why Kate ate salad, unrelated to Ben's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
