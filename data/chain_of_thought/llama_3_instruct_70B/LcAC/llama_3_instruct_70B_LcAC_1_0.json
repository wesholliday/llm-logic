Sue was at the wedding (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too. But this doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding. However, this fact alone does not provide enough information to conclude that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nThe conditional statement (1) only guarantees that if Mary was present, then Sue would be too. It doesn't imply the converse, i.e., if Sue is present, then Mary must be present as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
