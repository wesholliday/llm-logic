We have two statements:\n   - \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A implies that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack.\n\n3. Statement B tells us that one of those possibilities (the scarf being on the coat rack) might not be true.\n\n4. If the scarf is not on the coat rack, then according to Statement A, the only other possibility is that it must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\n5. Therefore, given both statements, we can infer that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
