This implies that there are only two possible locations for the notebook: the drawer and the nightstand.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\". This means we can't be certain that the notebook is on the nightstand, but it doesn't rule out the possibility entirely.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possible locations again. If the notebook is not on the nightstand (which is a possibility according to the second statement), then where could it be? The first statement tells us that there are only two options: the drawer and the nightstand. Since we've established that it might not be on the nightstand, the only remaining option is the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
