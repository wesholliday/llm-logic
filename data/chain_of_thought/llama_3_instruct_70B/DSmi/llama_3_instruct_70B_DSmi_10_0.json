This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the missing sock.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\". This means that there is a possibility that the sock is not under the bed.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the sock might not be under the bed, and the only other possible location is the laundry basket (as stated in the initial statement), then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
