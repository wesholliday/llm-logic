We are given two statements:\n   - Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n   - The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the umbrella: either it's in the car or it's in the closet.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities (it being in the closet) might not be true.\n\n4. If the umbrella is not in the closet, then according to the first statement, it must be in the car.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
