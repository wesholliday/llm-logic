This implies that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden.\n\n2. The second statement says \"Fido might not be in the garden\". This means that there's a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If Fido might not be in the garden, and we know that either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden, then it's possible that Fido is not in the garden. \n\n4. In this case, since Fido is not in the garden (or at least might not be), the only other option left is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
