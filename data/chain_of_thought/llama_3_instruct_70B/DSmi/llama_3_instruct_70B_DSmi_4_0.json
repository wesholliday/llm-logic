This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A is \"the cat is napping on the couch\" and B is \"it must be playing in the bedroom\".\n\n2. The second statement is \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\". This implies that B (playing in the bedroom) might be false.\n\n3. If B might be false, then according to the original statement \"A or B\", A (napping on the couch) must be true, because if B is not true, then A has to be true for the \"or\" condition to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
