            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the smip was shripped\" and B is \"the smip lupped the zoint\".\n2. We are also given that \"The smip was not shripped\", which means \u00acA (not A) is true.\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The smip did not lup the zoint\", which is \u00acB.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\n\u00acA \u2192 \u00ac(A \u2192 B)\n\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\n\nSince we have \u00acA (the smip was not shripped), we can infer \u00acB (the smip did not lup the zoint).\n\nAnswer: yes",
