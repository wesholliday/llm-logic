            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This can be represented as \"S \u2192 T\", where S means \"the glip was slogged\" and T means \"the glip was tragged\".\n2. We are given that \"The glip was not slogged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (not S).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not tragged\", which is represented as \"\u00acT\".\n\nUsing the rules of inference, we can apply modus tollens:\n\nIf S \u2192 T and \u00acS, then \u00acT.\n\nIn our case, this means that if \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" (S \u2192 T) and \"The glip was not slogged\" (\u00acS), then we can conclude that \"The glip was not tragged\" (\u00acT).\n\nAnswer: yes",
