            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 P\", where V means \"the smonk was vreebled\" and P means \"the smonk plagged\".\n2. We are also given that \"The smonk was not vreebled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acV\" (not V).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The smonk was not plagged\", which would be \"\u00acP\".\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply modus tollens:\n\nIf V \u2192 P and \u00acV, then \u00acP.\n\nIn our case, this means that if \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" (V \u2192 P) is true, and \"The smonk was not vreebled\" (\u00acV) is also true, then we can conclude that \"The smonk was not plagged\" (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
