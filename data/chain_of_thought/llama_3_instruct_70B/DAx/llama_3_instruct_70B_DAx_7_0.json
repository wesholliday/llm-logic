We have a conditional statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This can be represented as \"Shanked \u2192 Tinked\".\n2. We are also given that \"The whiffle was not shanked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acShanked\" (where \u00ac denotes negation).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink\", which can be represented as \"\u00acTinked\".\n4. From the conditional statement in step 1, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. But since we know the whiffle was not shanked (step 2), we can conclude that the condition for the whiffle to tink is not met.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
