This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanking) must also be true.\n\n2. Now, we are given the additional information \"The splat was not morphed\". This tells us that the condition in the original statement is false.\n\n3. Since the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence from the original statement alone. However, we can use the fact that the condition is false to make a new inference.\n\n4. If the splat was not morphed, and being morphed is the only way for the splat to quank (as implied by the original statement), then it must be the case that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
