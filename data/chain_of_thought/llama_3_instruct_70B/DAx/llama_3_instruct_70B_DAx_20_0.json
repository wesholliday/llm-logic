The fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the fleeg is bluttered, it will surn. But statement 2 tells us that the fleeg is NOT bluttered.\n\nSo, since the condition for the fleeg to surn (i.e., being bluttered) is not met, we can conclude that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nAnswer: yes",
