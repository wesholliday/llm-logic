            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\", where P means \"the shank was plooked\" and N means \"the shank was nugged\".\n2. We are also given that \"The shank was not plooked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\" (not P).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\", which would be \"\u00acN\".\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply modus tollens:\n\nIf P \u2192 N and \u00acP, then \u00acN.\n\nIn our case, this means that if \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" (P \u2192 N) and \"The shank was not plooked\" (\u00acP), then we can conclude that \"The shank was not nugged\" (\u00acN).\n\nAnswer: yes",
