            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This can be represented as \"F \u2192 S\", where F means \"the zinger was fraggled\" and S means \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The zinger was not fraggled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acF\" (not F).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\", which would be \"\u00acS\".\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply modus tollens:\n\nIf F \u2192 S and \u00acF, then \u00acS.\n\nIn other words, if it's true that \"if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled\" (F \u2192 S), and we know that the zinger was not fraggled (\u00acF), then we can conclude that the zinger was not smoogled (\u00acS).\n\nAnswer: yes",
