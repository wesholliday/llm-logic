            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This can be represented as \"F \u2192 S\", where F means \"the clug was fleeked\" and S means \"the clug snugged\".\n2. We are also given that \"The clug was not fleeked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acF\" (not F).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not snugged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\".\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply modus tollens:\n\nIf F \u2192 S and \u00acF, then \u00acS.\n\nIn our case, this means that if \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" (F \u2192 S) is true, and \"The clug was not fleeked\" (\u00acF) is also true, then we can conclude that \"The clug was not snugged\" (\u00acS).\n\nAnswer: yes",
