The wug was not sproinged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, statement 2 tells us that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nSince the condition for being garpled (i.e., being sproinged) is not met, we can conclude that the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
