            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be represented as \"Sploffed \u2192 Plopped\" (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\").\n2. We are also given that \"The grommet was not sploffed,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acSploffed\" (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\").\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acPlopped\".\n4. From the conditional statement in step 1, we know that if the grommet was sploffed, then it would have plopped the frink. But since the grommet was not sploffed (step 2), we cannot conclude that it plopped the frink.\n5. In fact, the absence of \"Sploffed\" means that the condition for \"Plopped\" is not met. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
