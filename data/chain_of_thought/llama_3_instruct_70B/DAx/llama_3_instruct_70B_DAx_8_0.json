            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C means \"the sprocket was cranked\" and D means \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The sprocket was not cranked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\" (not C).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\", which is represented as \"\u00acD\".\n\nUsing the rules of inference, we can apply modus tollens:\n\nIf C \u2192 D and \u00acC, then \u00acD.\n\nIn our case, this means that if \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" (C \u2192 D) and \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (\u00acC), then we can conclude that \"The sprocket was not daggled\" (\u00acD).\n\nAnswer: yes",
