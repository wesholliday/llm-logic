            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This can be represented as \"Skizzled \u2192 Movated\" (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\").\n2. We are also given that \"The flob was not skizzled,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acSkizzled\" (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\").\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The flob was not movated,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acMovated.\"\n4. Since the flob was not skizzled, the conditional statement \"Skizzled \u2192 Movated\" does not provide any information about whether the flob movated or not.\n5. However, if the flob were movated, it would imply that the flob must have been skizzled (by modus tollens), which contradicts the fact that the flob was not skizzled.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that if the flob was not skizzled, then it cannot be movated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
