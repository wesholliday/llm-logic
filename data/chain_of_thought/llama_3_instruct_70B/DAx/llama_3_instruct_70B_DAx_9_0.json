The twonk was not plinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, statement 2 tells us that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nSince the condition for being varnished (i.e., being plinked) is not met, we cannot conclude that the twonk was varnished. In fact, if the twonk was not plinked, then it's likely that it was not varnished either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
