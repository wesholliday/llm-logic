            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". This can be represented as \"V \u2192 S\", where V means \"the dreb was vroombed\" and S means \"the dreb was spened\".\n2. The second premise is \"The dreb was not vroombed\", which can be represented as \"\u00acV\" (not V).\n3. We want to know if we can infer \"The dreb was not spened\", which would be \"\u00acS\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If V were true, then S would have to be true due to the conditional statement.\n* But we know \u00acV is true, so V is false.\n* Since V is false, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee anything about S. However, it also doesn't prevent S from being false.\n* The only way to conclude \u00acS would be if the conditional statement were a biconditional (i.e., \"If and only if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"), but that's not the case here.\n\nAnswer: yes",
