We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" (denoted as \u00acA, where A means \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge\")\n   - \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" (denoted as A \u2228 B, where B means \"it is on the counter\")\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that A is false (\u00acA).\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement: A \u2228 B. Since A is false, the only way for A \u2228 B to be true is if B is true.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that B (\"the milk is on the counter\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
