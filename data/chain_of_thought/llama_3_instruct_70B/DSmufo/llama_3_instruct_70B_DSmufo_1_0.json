This means that Fido does not necessarily have to be in the garden.\n2. We also have the statement \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\". This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements together:\n\n* If Fido must be in the garden, then the first statement would be false. But we know it's true, so Fido does not necessarily have to be in the garden.\n* Since Fido doesn't have to be in the garden, the only other option left is that Fido is inside (because of the \"or\" statement).\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
