We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" (which can be rewritten as \"The book does not have to be on the table\")\n   - \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the book doesn't necessarily have to be on the table.\n\n3. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the book has to be on the table or it's on the shelf.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the book doesn't have to be on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
