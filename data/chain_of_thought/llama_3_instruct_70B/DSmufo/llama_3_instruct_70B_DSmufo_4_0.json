We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" (which can be rewritten as \"The cat cannot be playing in the bedroom\")\n   - \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\n3. Now, let's examine the second statement: \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\". This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\n4. Since we know from step 2 that the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom (the first option), the only possibility left is that the cat is napping on the couch (the second option).\n\nAnswer: yes",
