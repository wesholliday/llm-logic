We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as \"The missing sock is not under the bed\".\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement B. It says that either the sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. Since we know from statement A that the sock is not under the bed, the only other option left is that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
