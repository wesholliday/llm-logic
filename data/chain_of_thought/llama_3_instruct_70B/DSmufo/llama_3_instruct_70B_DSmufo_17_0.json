We are given two statements:\n   - It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack (\u00acA)\n   - Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack (A \u2228 B)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack.\n\n3. Now, let's examine the second statement: A \u2228 B. This means either A (scarf on coat rack) or B (scarf in backpack) must be true.\n\n4. Since we already know \u00acA (scarf is not on coat rack), the only possibility left for A \u2228 B to be true is if B (scarf in backpack) is true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
