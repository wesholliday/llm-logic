We have two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" (which can be rewritten as \"The cookies do not necessarily have to be hidden in the pantry\")\n   - \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the cookies might not be in the pantry.\n\n3. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the cookies must be in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the cookies don't necessarily have to be in the pantry, the only other option left is that they are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
