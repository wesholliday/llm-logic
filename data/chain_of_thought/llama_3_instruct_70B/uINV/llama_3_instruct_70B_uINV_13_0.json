This would be represented as:\n\n\"If not P (car is not red), then not Q (truck is not blue)\"\n\nHowever, this is a classic case of a logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent\". Just because we know that if the car is red, the truck is blue, it does not mean that if the car is not red, the truck cannot be blue. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue or not blue, regardless of the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a definitive inference about the color of the truck based solely on the fact that the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
