This would mean:\n\n\"If not A (apple is not red), then not B (banana is not yellow)\"\n\nHowever, this is a classic case of a logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent\". Just because we know that \"If A, then B\", it does not necessarily mean that \"If not A, then not B\".\n\nTo illustrate this, consider an example where the apple is not red (maybe it's green). We can't conclude that the banana is not yellow just because the apple is not red. The original statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
