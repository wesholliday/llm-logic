In other words, we want to know if the following statement is true:\n\nTom does not watch football \u2192 Jen does not watch basketball\n\nTo determine this, let's analyze the original conditional statement. If Tom watches football, it guarantees that Jen watches basketball. However, what if Tom doesn't watch football? The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens in this case.\n\nIn particular, just because Tom doesn't watch football, we can't conclude that Jen didn't watch basketball. Maybe Jen watched basketball regardless of whether Tom watched football or not. We simply don't have enough information to make a conclusion about Jen's actions based on Tom's non-action.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
