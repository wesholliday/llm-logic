Specifically, it means that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob will definitely choose pasta.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that \"if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta (given)\n2. Sue did not choose pizza \u2192 ? (we want to determine what happens to Bob's choice)\n\nNotice that the original statement only tells us what happens when Sue chooses pizza, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nIn other words, there is no logical connection between Sue not choosing pizza and Bob's choice. Bob could still choose pasta even if Sue didn't choose pizza, or he might choose something else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
