This can be represented as:\n\n\"If not P, then not Q\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's analyze the original conditional statement. The statement only tells us what happens when Joe goes to the park (i.e., Lucy goes to the zoo). It does not provide any information about what happens when Joe does not go to the park.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not guarantee that if Joe doesn't go to the park, Lucy won't go to the zoo. There might be other reasons why Lucy goes to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" solely based on the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
