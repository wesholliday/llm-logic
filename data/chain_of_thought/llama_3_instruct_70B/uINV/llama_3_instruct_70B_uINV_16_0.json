In other words, can we conclude: Not Cotton Shirt \u2192 Not Denim Pants?\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are definitely denim (given statement).\n2. If the shirt is not cotton, there are two possible scenarios:\n   a. The pants could still be denim (we don't have any information that contradicts this).\n   b. The pants could be something other than denim.\n\nSince we can't rule out scenario 2a, where the pants are denim even if the shirt is not cotton, we cannot conclude that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
