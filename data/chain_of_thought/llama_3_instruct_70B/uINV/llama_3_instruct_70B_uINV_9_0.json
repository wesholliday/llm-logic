It only tells us what happens when Lisa buys the red shirt (i.e., Mark buys the blue shirt). However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not guarantee that if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt, Mark won't buy the blue shirt. There might be other scenarios where Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt, but Mark still buys the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
