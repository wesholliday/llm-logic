This would be represented as:\n\n\u00acP (doll is not plastic) \u2192 \u00acM (truck is not metal)\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's analyze the given conditional statement. The statement only tells us what happens when the doll is plastic, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that a plastic doll implies a metal truck, it doesn't necessarily mean that a non-plastic doll implies a non-metal truck. There could be other possibilities for the material of the truck when the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a definitive inference about the material of the truck based solely on the fact that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
