If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that whenever Sam takes a plane, we can be certain that Erin takes a train.\n\nHowever, what if Sam did not take a plane? The original statement does not provide any information about what happens in this case. It only tells us what happens when Sam takes a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. There might be cases where Sam doesn't take a plane, but Erin still takes a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
