            "content": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThis implies a conditional relationship between the vampire's state and the mummy's state. Specifically, if the vampire is awake, we can conclude that the mummy is also awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse scenario: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nWe need to determine whether this conclusion logically follows from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake. It does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nIn other words, there might be cases where the vampire is not awake, but the mummy is still awake (perhaps due to some other factor). The original statement does not rule out this possibility.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. The relationship only holds in one direction: from the vampire's wakefulness to the mummy's wakefulness, but not necessarily the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no",
