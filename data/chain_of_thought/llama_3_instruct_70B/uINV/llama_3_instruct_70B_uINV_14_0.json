This would mean:\n\n\u00acBear_in_cave \u2192 \u00acWolf_in_den\n\nTo determine if this is true, let's analyze the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens when the bear is in the cave (i.e., the wolf is also in the den). It does not provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not guarantee that if the bear is not in the cave, the wolf must not be in the den. There could be scenarios where the bear is not in the cave, but the wolf still is in the den.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
