The original statement only guarantees that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn is also in the forest. It does not provide any information about what happens when the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn, it does not mean that the absence of the griffin implies the absence of the unicorn. There could be other reasons why the unicorn is or is not in the forest, regardless of the griffin's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
