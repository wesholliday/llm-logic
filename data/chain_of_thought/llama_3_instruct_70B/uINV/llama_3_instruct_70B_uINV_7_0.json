This would mean:\n\nAlex does not finish \u2192 Chris does not finish\n\nTo determine if this is true, let's analyze the original statement. If Alex finished the race, it guarantees that Chris finished the race. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Alex does not finish the race.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only tells us about the situation where Alex finishes, but it remains silent about the situation where Alex does not finish. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about Chris's status based on Alex not finishing the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
