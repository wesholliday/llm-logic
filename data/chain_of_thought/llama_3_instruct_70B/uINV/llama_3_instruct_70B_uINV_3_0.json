This would be equivalent to saying:\n\n\"If James did not write the book \u2192 The book is not a mystery novel\"\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily follow from the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens if James wrote the book (i.e., it's a mystery novel), but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if someone else wrote the book.\n\nFor example, it's possible that John wrote the book and it's also a mystery novel. Or maybe Sarah wrote the book and it's a romance novel. The original statement doesn't provide enough information to make any conclusions about books written by people other than James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
