In other words, we want to know if the following statement is true:\n\nJeff does not play basketball \u2192 Amy does not play tennis\n\nTo determine this, let's analyze the original statement. If Jeff plays basketball, it guarantees that Amy plays tennis. However, what if Jeff doesn't play basketball? The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens in this case.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only tells us what happens when Jeff plays basketball, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when Jeff doesn't play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff didn't play basketball, then Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
