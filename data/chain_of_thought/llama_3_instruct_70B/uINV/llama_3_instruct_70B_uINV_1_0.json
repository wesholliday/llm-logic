However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not present.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as:\n\n\u00acMary \u2192 \u00acSue\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Mary is not at the wedding (\u00acMary), but Sue is at the wedding (Sue). In this case, the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not provide any information, as it only talks about what happens when Mary is present.\n2. Mary is not at the wedding (\u00acMary), and Sue is also not at the wedding (\u00acSue). In this case, we cannot conclude anything from the original statement.\n\nSince we cannot infer \u00acSue from \u00acMary based on the given information, we must be cautious in our conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
