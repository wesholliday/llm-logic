The original statement only tells us what happens when the cake is chocolate; it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that chocolate cake implies blueberry muffins, it doesn't mean that non-chocolate cake implies non-blueberry muffins. There could be other types of cakes and muffins that are unrelated to this specific conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
