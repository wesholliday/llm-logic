We are given two statements:\n   - \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\" statements).\n\n3. Now, we are given that Statement A is true, i.e., \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\".\n\n4. Using modus ponens on Statement A and the rewritten Statement B, we can conclude: \"The phone is in the living room\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
