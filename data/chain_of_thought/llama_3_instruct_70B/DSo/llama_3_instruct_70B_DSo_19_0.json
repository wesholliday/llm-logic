We are given two statements:\n   - \"The watch isn't on his wrist\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \n   \"If the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser\"\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"The watch isn't on his wrist\". \n\n4. Now, applying this to our rewritten Statement B, we get:\n   \"If the watch is not on his wrist (which is true), then it must be charging on the dresser\".\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The watch is charging on the dresser\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
