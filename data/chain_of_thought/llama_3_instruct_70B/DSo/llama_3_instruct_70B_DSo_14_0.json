We are given two statements:\n   - \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. Since Statement A tells us that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge, we can eliminate this option from Statement B.\n\n4. This leaves only one remaining possibility: \"The milk is on the counter\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
