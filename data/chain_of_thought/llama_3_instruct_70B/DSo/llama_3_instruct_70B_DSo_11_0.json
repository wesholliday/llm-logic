We are given two statements:\n   - \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the newspaper is not in the driveway, then it is sitting on the porch\" (using the equivalent form of \"either...or\" statements).\n\n3. Now, we are told that Statement A is true, which means the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\n4. Using our rewritten Statement B, if the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway (because the only other option is eliminated).\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
