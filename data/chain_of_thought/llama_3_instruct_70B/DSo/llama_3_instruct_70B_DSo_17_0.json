We are given two statements:\n   - The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n   - Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n4. Since the scarf can't be on the coat rack (from step 3) and there are only two possible locations (from step 2), we can conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
