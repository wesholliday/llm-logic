We have two statements:\n   - \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which implies that only one of the options can be true.\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\". This means the second option in Statement B (\"they are dangling in the cabinet\") is false.\n\n4. Since Statement B says it's either one or the other, and we've eliminated the second option, the only remaining possibility is that \"the keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
