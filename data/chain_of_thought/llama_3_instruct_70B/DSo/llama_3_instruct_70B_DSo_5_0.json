We have two statements:\n   - \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it's saying that one of the two options must be true:\n   - Option 1: The cookies are in the jar\n   - Option 2: The cookies are hidden in the pantry\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A, which says the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. This means Option 2 is false.\n\n4. Since Statement B says one of the two options must be true, and we know Option 2 is false (because the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry), that means Option 1 must be true: The cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
