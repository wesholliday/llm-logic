We have two statements:\n   - \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it presents two possible scenarios: \n   - The shoes are in the closet\n   - The shoes are lined up by the door\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A, which tells us that the shoes aren't lined up by the door. This means we can eliminate one of the possibilities presented in Statement B.\n\n4. Since the shoes aren't lined up by the door (Statement A), and Statement B says it's either one or the other, we are left with only one possibility: \n   - The shoes are in the closet\n\nAnswer: yes",
