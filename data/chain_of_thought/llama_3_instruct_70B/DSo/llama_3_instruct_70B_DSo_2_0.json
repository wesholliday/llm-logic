            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The book isn't resting on the table\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the book is not on the shelf, then it is resting on the table\" (using the rule of material implication).\n\n3. Now, we know that the book isn't resting on the table (from statement A). \n\n4. Using modus tollens (a logical rule), if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must be false.\n\n5. In our case, \"If the book is not on the shelf, then it is resting on the table\" is equivalent to \"If P, then Q\", where P = \"the book is not on the shelf\" and Q = \"it is resting on the table\". \n\n6. We know that Q (the book is resting on the table) is false (from statement A). Therefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude that P (the book is not on the shelf) must be false.\n\n7. If \"the book is not on the shelf\" is false, then its negation \"the book is on the shelf\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
