            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the jacket is not draped over the chair, then it is hanging in the closet\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\").\n\n3. Now, we are told that Statement A is true, i.e., \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\".\n\n4. Using modus tollens on Statement B (rewritten) and Statement A, we can conclude: \"If the jacket is not draped over the chair, then it is hanging in the closet\" and \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" imply \"The jacket is draped over the chair\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
