We are given two statements:\n   - \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the notebook is not in the drawer, then it is sitting on the nightstand\" (using the rule of material implication).\n\n3. Now, we know from Statement A that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\n4. Using modus tollens (denying the consequent) with our rewritten Statement B and Statement A, we can conclude: \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
