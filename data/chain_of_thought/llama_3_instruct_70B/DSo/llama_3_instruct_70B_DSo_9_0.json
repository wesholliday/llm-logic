We are given two statements:\n   - \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that these are the only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece.\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\n4. Since Statement B says it's either in the box or on the floor, and we've eliminated the \"on the floor\" option (from Statement A), the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
