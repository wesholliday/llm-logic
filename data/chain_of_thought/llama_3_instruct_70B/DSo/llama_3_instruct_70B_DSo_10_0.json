We are given two statements:\n   - \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that these are the only two possible locations for the missing sock.\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that the missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\n4. Since Statement B says it's either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and we've eliminated the possibility of it being under the bed (from Statement A), the only remaining option is that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
