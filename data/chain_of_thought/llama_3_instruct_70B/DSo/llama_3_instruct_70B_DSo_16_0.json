We are given two statements:\n   - \"The pen isn't on my desk\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B implies that there are only two possible locations for the pen: either it's in the bag or it's on the desk.\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n4. Since the pen can't be on the desk (from Statement A) and there are only two possible locations (from Statement B), the only remaining possibility is that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
