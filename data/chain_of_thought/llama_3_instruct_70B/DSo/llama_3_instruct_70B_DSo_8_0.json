We are given two statements:\n   - \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \n   \"If the remote control is not on the coffee table, then it must be hiding under the couch\"\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement A, which says the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This means the condition in Statement B (\"it is hiding under the couch\") is false.\n\n4. Since the condition in Statement B is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true: \"the remote control is on the coffee table\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
