The second statement is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the options must be true.\n\n3. Since we know 'Fido is not in the garden' (from the first statement), it cannot be the case that 'Fido is in the garden'.\n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining option is that 'Fido is inside', because the \"either-or\" statement guarantees that one of the options must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
