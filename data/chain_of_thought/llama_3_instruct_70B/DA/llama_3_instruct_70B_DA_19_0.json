Tom did not watch football.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. But from statement 2, we know that Tom did not watch football.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball. \n\nIf Tom didn't watch football, it doesn't necessarily mean that Jen didn't watch basketball. The first statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when Tom doesn't watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Jen did not watch basketball based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
