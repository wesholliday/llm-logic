            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". This can be represented as \"B \u2192 W\", where B represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and W represents \"the wolf was in the den\".\n2. We are also given that \"The bear was not in the cave\", which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The wolf was not in the den\", which is represented as \"\u00acW\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement \"B \u2192 W\", we know that if B is true, then W must also be true. However, since we are given that \u00acB (the bear was not in the cave), we cannot conclude anything about W from this statement alone.\n4. In other words, just because the bear was not in the cave, it does not necessarily mean that the wolf was not in the den. There might be other reasons why the wolf was or was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
