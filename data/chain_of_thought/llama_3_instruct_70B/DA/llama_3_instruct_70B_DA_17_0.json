Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Ben eats pasta, Kate will eat the salad. But statement 2 tells us that Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: since Ben didn't eat pasta, we can't conclude anything about Kate eating the salad based on statement 1 alone. The condition \"Ben ate pasta\" was not met, so we can't infer what would happen to Kate.\n\nIn other words, just because Ben didn't eat pasta, it doesn't necessarily mean Kate didn't eat the salad. There might be other reasons why Kate did or didn't eat the salad that are unrelated to Ben's pasta-eating habits.\n\nAnswer: no",
