            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. The second statement is \"Mary was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\" (not M).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\", we know that if Mary was at the wedding (M), then Sue must have been at the wedding (S). However, since we know that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acM), the conditional statement does not provide any information about Sue's attendance.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Mary was not at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Sue was not at the wedding. There might be other reasons why Sue attended or did not attend the wedding, which are not related to Mary's attendance.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: no",
