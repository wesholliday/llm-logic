The doll was not plastic.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. But statement 2 tells us that the doll is not plastic. \n\nNow, let's analyze what this means for the truck:\n\nIf the doll is not plastic, it doesn't necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. The first statement only guarantees that if the doll is plastic, the truck is metal; it doesn't provide any information about the truck when the doll is not plastic.\n\nIn other words, we can't conclude anything about the truck's material based on these two statements alone. \n\nAnswer: no",
