The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, from statement 2, we know that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" is not true, we cannot conclude anything about the robot visiting Jupiter based on statement 1. The implication only holds if the alien visited Mars, but it didn't.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter solely based on these two statements. There might be other reasons why the robot did or did not visit Jupiter, but we can't determine that from this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
