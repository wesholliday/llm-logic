This implies that if Sue chooses pizza, Bob will definitely choose pasta.\n2. However, we are given that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n3. Since Sue didn't choose pizza, the condition in the initial statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Bob's choice based on this statement alone.\n\nIn other words, just because Sue didn't choose pizza, it doesn't necessarily mean Bob didn't choose pasta. There might be other factors or reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
