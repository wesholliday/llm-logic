Sam did not take a plane.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, from statement 2, we know that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nSince the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is not true, we cannot conclude anything about Erin taking a train or not taking a train based on statement 1. The implication only works if the condition is true, but in this case, it's false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train solely based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
