We have a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This implies that if the car is red, the truck must be blue.\n2. We are given additional information: \"The car was not red.\"\n3. Since the car is not red, the condition in the original conditional statement is not met (i.e., the car being red).\n4. In this case, we cannot conclude anything about the truck's color based on the original conditional statement.\n5. The fact that the car is not red does not provide any information about the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
