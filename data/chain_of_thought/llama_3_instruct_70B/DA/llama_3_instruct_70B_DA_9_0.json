            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n2. We are given that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\", which means \u00acP (not P) is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", which is \u00acQ.\n\nFrom the conditional statement P \u2192 Q, we know that if P is false (\u00acP), it does not necessarily mean Q is false (\u00acQ). In other words, the truth of \u00acP does not guarantee the truth of \u00acQ. This is because the conditional statement only guarantees Q when P is true, but it doesn't provide any information about Q when P is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" (\u00acQ) solely from the fact that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: no",
