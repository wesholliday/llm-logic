The shirt was not cotton.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. But statement 2 tells us that the shirt is NOT cotton.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the shirt is not cotton, it doesn't necessarily mean the pants are not denim. The pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n* Statement 1 only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the shirt is NOT cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The pants were not denim\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
