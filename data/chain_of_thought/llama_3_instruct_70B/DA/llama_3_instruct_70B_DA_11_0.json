We have a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This implies that if the cake is indeed chocolate, then we can conclude that the muffins are blueberry.\n2. However, we're given additional information: \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This means the condition in the original statement (the cake being chocolate) is not met.\n3. Since the condition is not met, we cannot make any conclusions about the muffins based on this conditional statement alone.\n\nNow, can we infer that \"The muffins were not blueberry\"? Not necessarily. We only know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry, but since the cake wasn't chocolate, we don't have enough information to determine whether the muffins are or aren't blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
