            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"R \u2192 Y\", where R means \"the apple is red\" and Y means \"the banana is yellow\".\n2. We are given that \"The apple was not red\", which can be represented as \"\u00acR\" (not R).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The banana was not yellow\", which can be represented as \"\u00acY\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement R \u2192 Y, we know that if R is true, then Y must also be true. However, since \u00acR is given, it means that R is false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement R \u2192 Y does not provide any information about what happens when R is false. It only tells us what happens when R is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \u00acY (the banana was not yellow) from the given statements. The truth value of Y remains unknown.\n\nAnswer: no",
