            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\". This can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race\".\n2. The second statement is \"Alex did not finish the race\", which can be represented as \"\u00acA\" (not A).\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"Chris did not finish the race\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nUsing the rules of inference, we can apply Modus Tollens:\n\nIf A \u2192 C is true, and \u00acA is true, then we can conclude \u00acC.\n\nIn this case, we have A \u2192 C (the conditional statement) and \u00acA (Alex did not finish the race). Therefore, we can indeed infer \u00acC, which means \"Chris did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
