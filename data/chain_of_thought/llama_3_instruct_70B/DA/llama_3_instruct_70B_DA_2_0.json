The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present. However, statement 2 tells us that the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would be in the forest (from statement 1).\n* But the griffin is not in the forest (from statement 2).\n\nSince the condition for the unicorn to be in the forest (i.e., the griffin being in the forest) is not met, we can conclude that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not guaranteed.\n\nIn other words, the absence of the griffin does not provide enough information to determine the unicorn's location. The unicorn could still be in the forest or not; we simply don't have enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
