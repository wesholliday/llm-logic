Joe did not go to the park.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe had gone to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, statement 2 tells us that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nSince Joe didn't go to the park, the condition for Lucy going to the zoo (as stated in statement 1) is not met. But this doesn't necessarily mean Lucy didn't go to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
