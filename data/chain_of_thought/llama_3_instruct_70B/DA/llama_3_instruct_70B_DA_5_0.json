Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, statement 2 tells us that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: since Jeff didn't play basketball, the condition for Amy to play tennis (as stated in statement 1) is not met. But this doesn't necessarily mean Amy didn't play tennis. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Amy did not play tennis based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
