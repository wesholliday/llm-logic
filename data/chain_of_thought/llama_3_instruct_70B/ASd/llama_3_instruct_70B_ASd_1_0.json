This is because the water interferes with the combustion process necessary for the match to ignite.\n\nGiven this additional information, we cannot logically infer that the match will light if it's been soaked in water, even if it's struck. The original statement only guarantees that a struck match will light under normal circumstances, not when it's been compromised by being soaked in water.\n\nAnswer: no",
