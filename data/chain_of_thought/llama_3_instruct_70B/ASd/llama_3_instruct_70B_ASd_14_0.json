However, the original statement doesn't mention anything about the language of the test. It only focuses on studying hard.\n\nIf studying hard is sufficient for passing the test regardless of the language, then it's reasonable to assume that studying hard and the test being in Chinese would also lead to passing the test.\n\nIn other words, the additional condition \"the test is in Chinese\" doesn't contradict or negate the original statement. It's still possible that studying hard would be enough to pass the test, even if it's in Chinese.\n\nAnswer: yes",
