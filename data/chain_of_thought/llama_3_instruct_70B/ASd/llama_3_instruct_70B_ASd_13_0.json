In other words, eating junk food might counteract or even outweigh the positive effects of exercising.\n\nGiven this, we cannot logically conclude that \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight.\" The addition of eating junk food introduces a conflicting factor that undermines the original claim.\n\nAnswer: no",
