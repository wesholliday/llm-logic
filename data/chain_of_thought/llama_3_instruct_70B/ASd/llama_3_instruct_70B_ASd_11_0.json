The original statement only guarantees that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness, but it doesn't take into account other factors like physical activity (hard labor). Hard labor can cause fatigue, regardless of how much sleep you get.\n\nIn this new scenario, we're adding an additional factor (hard labor) that could potentially counteract the benefits of getting enough sleep. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that getting enough sleep and doing hard labor will prevent tiredness.\n\nAnswer: no",
