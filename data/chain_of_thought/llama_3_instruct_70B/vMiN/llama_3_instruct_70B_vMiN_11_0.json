In other words, the premise is saying \"it might not be\" (possibility), while the conclusion is saying \"it doesn't have to be\" (necessity).\n\nLogically, if something might not be the case, it implies that it's not necessarily true. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
