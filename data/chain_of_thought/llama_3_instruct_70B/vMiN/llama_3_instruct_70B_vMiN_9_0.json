This implies that we cannot be certain that she must have bought the red shirt. In other words, if there's a chance she didn't buy it, then it's not necessarily true that she must have bought it.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because the premise introduces uncertainty about Lisa's action (buying the red shirt), and the conclusion simply acknowledges this uncertainty by stating that we cannot be certain about her buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
