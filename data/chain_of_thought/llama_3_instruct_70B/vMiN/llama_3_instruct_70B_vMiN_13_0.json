The premise is saying that there's a chance the toy isn't in the toy box, while the conclusion is saying that it's not required for the toy to be in the toy box.\n\nIn this case, the argument seems valid because if there's a possibility that the toy might not be in the toy box (as stated in the premise), then it's reasonable to conclude that it's not necessarily true that the toy must be in the toy box (as stated in the conclusion).\n\nAnswer: yes",
