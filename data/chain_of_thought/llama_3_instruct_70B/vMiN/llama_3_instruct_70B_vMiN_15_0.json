This uncertainty is consistent with the idea that it's not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet (conclusion).\n\nIn other words, if there's a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet, then it can't be said that they must be in the closet. The premise provides evidence against the necessity of the shoes being in the closet, which supports the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
