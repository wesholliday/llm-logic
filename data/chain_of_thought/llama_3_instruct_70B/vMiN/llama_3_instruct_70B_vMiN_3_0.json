In other words, if there is doubt about James' authorship, then it's reasonable to say that it's not necessarily true that he wrote the book.\n\nThe argument seems to be using a modus tollens-like reasoning:\n\nIf it's possible that James didn't write the book (premise), then it's not necessary that James wrote the book (conclusion).\n\nThis form of argument appears to be logically valid, as the conclusion follows naturally from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
