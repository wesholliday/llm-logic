This implies that we cannot be certain that Jeff must have played basketball. In other words, if there's a chance he didn't play, then it's not necessarily true that he had to play.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because the premise introduces uncertainty about Jeff's basketball-playing, and the conclusion simply acknowledges that uncertainty by denying the necessity of Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
