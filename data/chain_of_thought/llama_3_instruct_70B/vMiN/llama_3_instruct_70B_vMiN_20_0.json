The conclusion, on the other hand, denies the necessity of the sunglasses being in her bag.\n\nIn logical terms, the premise is saying \"\u00ac(must be in her bag)\" (it's possible they're not), and the conclusion is saying \"\u00ac(must be in her bag)\" as well (it's not necessarily true they are). These two statements are equivalent, which means the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
