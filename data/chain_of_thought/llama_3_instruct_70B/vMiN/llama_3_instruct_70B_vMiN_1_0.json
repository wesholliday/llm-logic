This implies that we can't be certain or conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding. In other words, if there's a chance she wasn't there, then it's not necessarily true that she must have been there.\n\nThe argument seems to be saying that if there's uncertainty or possibility of Mary not being at the wedding, then we can't conclude that she definitely was there. This makes sense logically.\n\nAnswer: yes",
