This implies that it's not necessarily true that the pen must be in the bag. In other words, if there's a chance the pen is not in the bag, then it can't be said that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because the possibility of the pen not being in the bag (premise) contradicts the idea that the pen must be in the bag (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: yes",
