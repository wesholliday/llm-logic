The premise is saying that there's a chance the milk isn't on the counter, while the conclusion is saying that it's not required for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nIn this case, the argument seems valid because if there's a possibility that the milk might not be on the counter, then it can't be said that the milk must be on the counter. The premise provides sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
