If Sue might not have chosen pizza, it means that there is a chance she didn't choose pizza. This does imply that it's not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza, which is what the conclusion states.\n\nIn other words, if there's a possibility that Sue didn't choose pizza (as stated in the premise), then we cannot conclude with certainty that Sue must have chosen pizza. The conclusion logically follows from the premise, as it denies the necessity of Sue choosing pizza based on the possibility of her not choosing it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
