This implies that we cannot conclude with certainty that the griffin must have been in the forest. In other words, if there's a chance the griffin wasn't there, then it's not necessarily true that it had to be there.\n\nThe argument seems to be logically valid because the conclusion follows naturally from the premise. The premise introduces doubt about the griffin's presence, and the conclusion correctly infers that we cannot assert its necessary presence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
