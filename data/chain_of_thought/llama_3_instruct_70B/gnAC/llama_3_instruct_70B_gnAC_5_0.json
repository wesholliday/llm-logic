It says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since we already know that Amy played tennis (from statement 2), this conditional statement is satisfied. However, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball.\n\nThink of it like this: just because Amy played tennis doesn't mean Jeff had to play basketball for her to do so. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
