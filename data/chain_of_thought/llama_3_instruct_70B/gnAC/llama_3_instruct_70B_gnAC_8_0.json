However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must be awake.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will be awake, but it does not provide any information about the converse (i.e., if the mummy is awake, the vampire might or might not be awake).\n\nGiven that we know the mummy was awake (statement 2), we cannot conclude with certainty that the vampire was also awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake that are unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it does not necessarily follow that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
