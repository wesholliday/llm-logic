But this doesn't necessarily mean that Joe went to the park.\n\nThink of it like this: just because Lucy went to the zoo, it doesn't automatically imply that Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nFor example, maybe Lucy loves zoos and goes there every weekend. In that case, she would have gone to the zoo regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
