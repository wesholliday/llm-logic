This implies a conditional relationship between the author being James and the genre being a mystery novel.\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels as well.\n\nIn logic, this is known as the \"converse error\" or \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because we know the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) is true, it doesn't automatically imply that the antecedent (the book being written by James) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
