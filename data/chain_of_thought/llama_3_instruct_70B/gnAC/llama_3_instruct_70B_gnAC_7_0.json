This implies a conditional relationship between Alex finishing the race and Chris finishing the race.\n2. We are also given that \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince \"Chris finished the race\" is true, we know that the consequence of the conditional statement (i.e., Chris finishing the race) has occurred.\n\nThe question is whether this necessarily implies that Alex finished the race. \n\nWell, if Alex had not finished the race, it would still be possible for Chris to have finished the race (perhaps Chris was faster or more determined). The conditional statement only guarantees that if Alex finishes, then Chris will finish; it does not guarantee the converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that Alex finished the race simply because Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
