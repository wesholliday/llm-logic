            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (conditional statement)\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" (true statement)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too. This implies a causal relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nNow, given that Sue was indeed at the wedding (statement 2), we can try to infer whether Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial point to consider: just because Sue was at the wedding doesn't necessarily mean Mary was. There could be other reasons why Sue attended the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" only guarantees that if Mary was present, Sue would also be present. It does not imply the converse: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
