But this doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nJust because Erin took a train (statement 2), it doesn't imply that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam's actions.\n\nIn logic, this is known as the \"converse error\" - assuming that if B follows from A, then A must be true when we know B is true. But this is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
