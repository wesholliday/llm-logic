However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck is blue, the car must be red.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the car is red, the truck will be blue, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is blue.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck is indeed blue. However, this could be due to various reasons, including the possibility that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The car was red\" is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
