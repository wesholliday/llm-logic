But this does not necessarily mean that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the doll is plastic, then the truck will be metal, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is metal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is necessarily true. There might be other reasons why the truck is metal, unrelated to the doll being plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
