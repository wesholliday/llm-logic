This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the alien visited Mars\" and the consequent is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that the robot did indeed visit Jupiter.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter, unrelated to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because the consequent (the robot visiting Jupiter) is true, it doesn't necessarily follow that the antecedent (the alien visiting Mars) is also true.\n\nAnswer: no",
