However, the converse is not necessarily true. Just because Kate ate salad, it doesn't mean that Ben necessarily ate pasta.\n\nThink of a scenario where Kate ate salad for some other reason unrelated to Ben's eating pasta. In this case, statement 2 would still be true, but we can't conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
