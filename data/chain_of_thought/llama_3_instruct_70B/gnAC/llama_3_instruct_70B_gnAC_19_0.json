There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nFor example, maybe Jen just loves basketball and always watches it, regardless of what Tom does.\n\nSo, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Tom watched football\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
