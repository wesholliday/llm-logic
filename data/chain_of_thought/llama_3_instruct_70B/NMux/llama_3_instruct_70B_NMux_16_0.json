This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the sneg was crampled.\n2. The negation of \"must have been\" implies a lack of necessity or obligation. In other words, it's possible that the sneg wasn't crampled.\n3. Since we can't infer that the sneg must have been crampled, and there's no evidence to suggest it definitely was, we can consider the possibility that it might not have been crampled.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
