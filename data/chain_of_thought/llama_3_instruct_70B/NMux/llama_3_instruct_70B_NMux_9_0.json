This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the twonk was plinked.\n2. The negation of \"must have been plinked\" implies that there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked.\n3. Since we cannot infer that the twonk was definitely plinked, and there is a possibility that it wasn't, we can conclude that the twonk might not have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
