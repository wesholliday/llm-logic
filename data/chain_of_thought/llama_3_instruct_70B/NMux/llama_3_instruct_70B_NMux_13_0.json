This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the glip was slogged.\n2. If we negate the idea of necessity (\"must have been\"), we are left with a possibility or lack thereof. In other words, if it's not necessary that the glip was slogged, then it might or might not have been slogged.\n3. The inference \"The glip might not have been slogged\" is a possible interpretation of the original statement. It acknowledges that we cannot conclude with certainty that the glip was slogged, leaving room for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
