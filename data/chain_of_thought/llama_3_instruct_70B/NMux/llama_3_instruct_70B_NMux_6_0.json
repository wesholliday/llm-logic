This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the grommet was sploffed.\n2. The negation of \"must have been\" implies that there is some uncertainty or possibility involved. In other words, it's possible that the grommet was not sploffed.\n3. Now, let's consider the inference \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\". This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nGiven the original statement and our analysis, we can see that the inference \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\" is indeed a logical consequence. The original statement implies uncertainty about the grommet being sploffed, which aligns with the idea that it might not have been sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
