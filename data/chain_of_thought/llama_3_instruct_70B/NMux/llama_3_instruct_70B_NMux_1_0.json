This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the flugel was blimmed.\n2. The negation of \"must have been\" implies that there is some uncertainty or possibility involved. In other words, it's possible that the flugel was not blimmed.\n3. Now, let's consider the inference \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\". This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nGiven the original statement and our analysis, we can see that the inference \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" is indeed a logical consequence. The original statement implies uncertainty or possibility, which aligns with the idea that the flugel might not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
