This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the wug was definitely flooped.\n2. If we negate the idea of necessity (i.e., \"must have been\"), we are left with a possibility or uncertainty about whether the wug was flooped or not.\n3. Since we can't be certain that the wug was flooped, it's possible that the wug might not have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
