This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the splat was morphed.\n2. The negation of \"must have been\" implies that there might be other possibilities or uncertainties involved.\n3. If it's not necessary (or certain) that the splat was morphed, then it's possible that it wasn't morphed.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
