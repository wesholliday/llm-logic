This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the fleeg was bluttered.\n2. The negation of \"must have been\" implies that there is some uncertainty or possibility involved. In other words, it's possible that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n3. Now, let's consider the inference \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\". This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nGiven the original statement and our analysis, we can see that the inference \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" is indeed a logical consequence. The original statement implies uncertainty or possibility, which aligns with the idea that the fleeg might not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
