This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the whiffle was shanked.\n2. If we negate the idea of necessity (i.e., \"must have been\"), we are left with a possibility or uncertainty about whether the whiffle was shanked or not.\n3. Since we can't be certain that the whiffle was shanked, it's possible that it wasn't shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
