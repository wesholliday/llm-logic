This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the flob was skizzled.\n2. The negation of \"must have been\" implies that there is some uncertainty or possibility involved. In other words, it's possible that the flob wasn't skizzled.\n3. Now, let's consider the inference \"The flob might not have been skizzled\". This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nGiven the original statement and our analysis, we can see that the inference \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" is indeed a logical consequence. The original statement implies uncertainty or possibility, which aligns with the idea that the flob might not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
