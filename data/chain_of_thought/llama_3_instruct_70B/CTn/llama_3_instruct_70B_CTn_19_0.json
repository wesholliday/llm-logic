Since we know that if Tom watched football, Jen would have done something else (not watched basketball), it logically follows that if Jen watched basketball, Tom must not have watched football.\n\nIn other words, the original statement implies a mutual exclusivity between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. If one happens, the other cannot happen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
