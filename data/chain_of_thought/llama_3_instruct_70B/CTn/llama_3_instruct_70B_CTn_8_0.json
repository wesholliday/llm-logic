It sets up a mutual exclusivity between the two states.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nIf we assume the mummy is awake, can we conclude that the vampire must be asleep? Well, our original statement doesn't explicitly state this, but it does imply that if one is awake, the other cannot be. This means that if the mummy is awake, the vampire cannot be awake simultaneously.\n\nIn essence, the original statement and the proposed inference are saying the same thing: only one of them can be awake at a time. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
