In other words, the presence of a red car excludes the possibility of a blue truck.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\"\n\nIf the truck is indeed blue, it means that the condition \"the truck was not blue\" is false. Since this condition is a consequence of \"the car was red\", we can infer that \"the car was red\" must also be false (because if it were true, the truck would not be blue).\n\nTherefore, if the truck is blue, it implies that the car cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
