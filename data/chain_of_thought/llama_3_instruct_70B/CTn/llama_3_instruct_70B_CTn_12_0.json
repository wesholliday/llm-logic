In other words, Joe going to the park excludes the possibility of Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nWe can ask ourselves: Does Lucy going to the zoo exclude the possibility of Joe going to the park? \n\nThe answer is yes. If Lucy goes to the zoo, it means that Joe cannot have gone to the park (because if he had, Lucy wouldn't be at the zoo). This is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
