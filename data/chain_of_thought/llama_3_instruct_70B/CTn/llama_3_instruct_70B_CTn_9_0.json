            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nThis implies a conditional relationship between two events: Lisa buying the red shirt (antecedent) and Mark not buying the blue shirt (consequent).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer the converse: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the original statement:\n\n1. If Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark doesn't buy the blue shirt.\n2. This means that whenever Lisa buys the red shirt, it guarantees Mark won't buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse:\n\n3. If Mark buys the blue shirt, does it guarantee Lisa didn't buy the red shirt?\n4. Well, if Mark buying the blue shirt implies Lisa not buying the red shirt, then it means that whenever Mark buys the blue shirt, Lisa must not have bought the red shirt.\n5. But this is exactly what the original statement implies: when one event happens (Lisa buying the red shirt), the other event cannot happen (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nSince the converse is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
