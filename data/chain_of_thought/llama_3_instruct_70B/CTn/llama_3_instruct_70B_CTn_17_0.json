In other words, Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad at the same time is impossible.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\"\n\nThis statement says that if Kate eats the salad, then Ben cannot have eaten pasta. This is actually a logical consequence of the original statement!\n\nThink about it: if Kate eats the salad, and we know that Ben eating pasta would mean Kate didn't eat the salad (from the original statement), then it must be the case that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nSo, yes, we can indeed infer \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
