In other words, Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis at the same time is not possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\"\n\nIf Amy played tennis, it means that Jeff could not have played basketball (because if he did, Amy would not have played tennis). This is exactly what the original statement implies.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the inferred statement is indeed true. If Amy played tennis, it necessarily means that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
