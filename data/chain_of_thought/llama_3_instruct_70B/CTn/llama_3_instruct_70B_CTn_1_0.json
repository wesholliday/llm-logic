In other words, Mary's presence means Sue's absence.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\"\n\nWe can ask ourselves: Does the original statement guarantee that if Sue attended the wedding, Mary did not?\n\nThe answer is yes! If Sue was at the wedding, it would mean Mary wasn't (because of the original implication). So, the presence of Sue implies the absence of Mary.\n\nAnswer: yes",
