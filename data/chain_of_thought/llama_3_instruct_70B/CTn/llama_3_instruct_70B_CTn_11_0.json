            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\"\n\nThis implies that if the cake is chocolate, it's impossible for the muffins to be blueberry. In other words, the presence of a chocolate cake excludes the possibility of blueberry muffins.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\"\n\nThis statement is saying that if the muffins are blueberry, it's impossible for the cake to be chocolate. In other words, the presence of blueberry muffins excludes the possibility of a chocolate cake.\n\nNotice that this is essentially the same relationship as the original statement, but with the roles of \"cake\" and \"muffins\" reversed. If we accept that the original statement is true, it makes sense to conclude that if the muffins are blueberry, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nTherefore, I believe the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
