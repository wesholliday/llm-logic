In other words, James' authorship and the book being a mystery novel are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nThis statement says that if the book is a mystery novel, it must not have been written by James. This seems to be a logical conclusion based on our understanding of the original statement.\n\nIn essence, we are swapping the conditions and conclusions while maintaining the same logical relationship. If James' authorship implies the book is not a mystery novel, then it's reasonable to infer that if the book is a mystery novel, James cannot be the author.\n\nAnswer: yes",
