In other words, cotton shirt and denim pants cannot coexist.\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\"\n\nIf the pants are indeed denim, it means that the condition \"shirt is cotton\" must not be true (because cotton shirt and denim pants cannot coexist). Therefore, if the pants are denim, we can conclude that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
