In other words, if Sue chooses pizza, Bob must choose something else (not pasta).\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\"\n\nIf Bob chooses pasta, it means he didn't choose anything else (since he chose pasta). But we know that if Sue chooses pizza, Bob cannot choose pasta. Therefore, if Bob chooses pasta, it must be the case that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer the converse statement: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
