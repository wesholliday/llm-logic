In other words, a plastic doll and a metal truck cannot coexist.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\"\n\nIf the truck is indeed metal, it means that the condition \"the truck was not metal\" is false. Since this condition is only true when the doll is plastic (according to the original statement), we can conclude that if the truck is metal, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nIn other words, the proposed inference is a logical consequence of the original statement. If the truck is metal, it implies that the doll is not plastic, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes",
