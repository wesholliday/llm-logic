            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\"\n\nThis statement implies that if the griffin is present in the forest, the unicorn cannot be present. In other words, the presence of the griffin excludes the presence of the unicorn.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\"\n\nThis statement implies that if the unicorn is present in the forest, the griffin cannot be present. In other words, the presence of the unicorn excludes the presence of the griffin.\n\nNotice a pattern? Both statements are saying the same thing: one creature's presence excludes the other's presence. This suggests that the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
