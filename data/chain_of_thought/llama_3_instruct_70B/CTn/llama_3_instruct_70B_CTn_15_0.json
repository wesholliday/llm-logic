Can we conclude anything about Sam?\n* Since Erin taking a train implies that Sam did not take a plane (from the given statement), we can infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\n\nThis inference is valid because it's essentially the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
