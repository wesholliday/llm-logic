In other words, the presence of a red apple guarantees the absence of a yellow banana.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\"\n\nWe can ask ourselves: If the banana is indeed yellow, what can we conclude about the apple?\n\nWell, if the banana is yellow, it means that the condition \"the banana was not yellow\" is false. And since the original statement says \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\", we can infer that the antecedent \"the apple was red\" must also be false (because the consequent \"the banana was not yellow\" is false).\n\nTherefore, if the banana is yellow, it implies that the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
