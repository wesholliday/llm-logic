Jen watched basketball (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. But the converse is not necessarily true: just because Jen watched basketball, it doesn't mean Tom watched football.\n\nIn other words, there could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that Tom watched football simply because Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
