The cat was outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside. There could be other reasons why the cat is outside.\n\nFor example, maybe the dog is also outside, and the cat just happens to be outside too. Or maybe someone let the cat out while the dog was still outside.\n\nWe can't conclude for certain that the dog was inside just because the cat was outside. All we know is that if the dog was inside, the cat would be outside, but we don't have enough information to determine the dog's location.\n\nAnswer: no",
