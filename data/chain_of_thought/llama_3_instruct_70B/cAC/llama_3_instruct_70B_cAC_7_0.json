If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (implies that if Alex finished, Chris must have finished too)\n2. Chris finished the race (we know for sure that Chris finished)\n\nNow, we want to conclude whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Alex finished, Chris would have finished too. But we already know from statement 2 that Chris finished. However, this doesn't necessarily mean Alex finished. There could be other reasons why Chris finished, unrelated to Alex finishing.\n\nFor example, maybe Chris is a faster runner and finished the race regardless of what Alex did. In this case, statement 1 would still be true (if Alex finished, then Chris finished), but we can't conclude that Alex finished just because Chris finished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
