Bob chose pasta (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. But the converse is not necessarily true: just because Bob chose pasta, it doesn't mean Sue chose pizza.\n\nIn other words, there could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that Sue chose pizza simply because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
