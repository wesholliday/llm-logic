Lucy went to the zoo (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. But this doesn't necessarily mean that Joe went to the park.\n\nJust because Lucy went to the zoo (statement 2), it doesn't guarantee that Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that Joe went to the park based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
