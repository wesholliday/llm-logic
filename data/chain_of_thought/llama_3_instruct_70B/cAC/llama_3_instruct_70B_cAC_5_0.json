Amy played tennis (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. But this doesn't necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe fact that Amy played tennis (statement 2) only confirms the consequence of the conditional statement, but it doesn't provide any direct evidence about Jeff's actions.\n\nIn other words, just because Amy played tennis, we can't conclude for certain that Jeff played basketball. There might be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
