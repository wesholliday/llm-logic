The wolf was in the den (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the bear is in the cave, it implies that the wolf is in the den. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the wolf is in the den, the bear must be in the cave.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf will be in the den, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the wolf is in the den without knowing anything about the bear's location.\n\nGiven only these two statements, we cannot conclude with certainty that the bear was in the cave. There might be other reasons why the wolf is in the den, unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no",
