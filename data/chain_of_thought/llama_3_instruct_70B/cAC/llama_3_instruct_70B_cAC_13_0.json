The truck was blue (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the truck is blue, the car must be red.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the truth of the consequent (the truck being blue) if the antecedent (the car being red) is true. It does not provide any information about the antecedent being true if the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that the car was red simply because the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
