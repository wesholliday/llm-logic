The robot visited Jupiter (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. But we don't know for sure if the alien actually visited Mars.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the robot did visit Jupiter. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because we know the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) is true, it doesn't mean the antecedent (the alien visiting Mars) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
