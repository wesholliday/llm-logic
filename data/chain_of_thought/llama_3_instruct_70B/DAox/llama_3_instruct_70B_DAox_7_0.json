We are given two statements:\n   - \"The whiffle was not shanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"If the whiffle tinked, then it was shanked\" (This is called the contrapositive of the original statement).\n\n3. Now, we know from Statement A that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\n4. Using our rewritten Statement B, if the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink.\n\nSo, based on this logical progression...\n\nAnswer: yes",
