We are given two statements:\n   - \"The glip was not slogged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged\".\n\n3. Since we know from Statement A that \"the glip was not slogged\" (i.e., ~P), we can apply modus tollens to Statement B.\n\n4. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know ~P, then we can infer ~Q.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation, since we know ~P (\"the glip was not slogged\"), we can infer ~Q, which is \"the glip was not tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
