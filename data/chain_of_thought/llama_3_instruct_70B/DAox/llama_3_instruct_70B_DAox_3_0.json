We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat was not morphed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"If the splat quanked, then it was morphed\" (This is called the contrapositive of the original statement).\n\n3. Now, we know from Statement A that the splat was not morphed.\n\n4. Using our rewritten Statement B, if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
