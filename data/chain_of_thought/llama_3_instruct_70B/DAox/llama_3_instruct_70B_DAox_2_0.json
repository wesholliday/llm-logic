From the second statement, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint.\n\n3. However, from the first statement, we know that the wug did not floop.\n\n4. Since the wug did not floop, the condition for the wug to bim the zoint (as stated in the second statement) is not met.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
