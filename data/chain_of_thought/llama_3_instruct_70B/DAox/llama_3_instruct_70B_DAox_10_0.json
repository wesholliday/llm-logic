            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   - \"The wug was not sproinged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as:\n   - \"If NOT (the wug was sproinged), then NOT (it was garpled)\"\n\n3. Now, we can use Statement A to infer the antecedent of the rewritten Statement B:\n   - Since \"The wug was not sproinged\" is true, we can conclude that the antecedent \"NOT (the wug was sproinged)\" is also true.\n\n4. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can infer the consequent of the rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the antecedent \"NOT (the wug was sproinged)\" is true, then the consequent \"NOT (it was garpled)\" must also be true.\n\n5. Finally, we can rewrite the inferred consequent to get our desired conclusion:\n   - \"NOT (it was garpled)\" is equivalent to \"The wug was not garpled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
