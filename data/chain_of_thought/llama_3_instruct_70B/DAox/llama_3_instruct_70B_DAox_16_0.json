            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   - \"The sneg was not crampled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as:\n   - \"If NOT (the sneg was crampled), then NOT (the sneg sproted the frink)\"\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"The sneg was not crampled\" is true.\n\n4. Now, let's apply this truth to our rewritten conditional statement:\n   - If NOT (the sneg was crampled) [which is TRUE], then NOT (the sneg sproted the frink)\n\n5. Since the condition is true, we can infer that the consequence must also be true:\n   - NOT (the sneg sproted the frink), which means \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
