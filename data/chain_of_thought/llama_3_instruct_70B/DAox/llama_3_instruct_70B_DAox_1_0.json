We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flugel was not blimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that the flugel is not blimmed.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It says that if the flugel was blimmed, then it would be zargled. But since we know from Statement A that the flugel is not blimmed, this conditional statement (Statement B) does not apply in this case.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the flugel being zargled or not based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
