We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fribble was not snurgled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"If snurgled, then crinked\". This implies that if the fribble is snurgled, it must crink.\n\n3. Now, let's examine Statement A: \"The fribble was not snurgled\". This means the condition for the fribble to crink (being snurgled) is not met.\n\n4. Since the condition for crinking is not fulfilled, we can infer that the fribble did not crink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
