            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two possible locations for the sunglasses: either they are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n2. This is an \"either-or\" statement, which implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. In other words, the sunglasses can't be in both places at the same time, and there's no third option.\n3. We're then told that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head. This eliminates one of the two possible locations.\n4. Since we've eliminated the \"perched on her head\" option, and we know that the sunglasses must be in one of the two locations, it logically follows that they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
