This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. Now, we're given the additional information \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\". This tells us that the second option (cookies being hidden in the pantry) is false.\n\n3. Since the \"or\" statement requires at least one of the options to be true, and we know the second option is false, it must be the case that the first option is true: \"The cookies are in the jar\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
