We have two statements: \n   a) Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n   b) The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible locations for the missing sock: the laundry basket and under the bed.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities, 'under the bed', is not true.\n\n4. Since there are only two options, and one has been eliminated, the remaining option must be true. Therefore, the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
