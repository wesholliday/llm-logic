We are given two statements:\n   - Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf (A or B)\n   - The toy isn't sitting on the shelf (~B)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the toy box (A) and the shelf (B). \n\n3. The second statement tells us that the toy is not on the shelf (~B).\n\n4. Since the toy can't be on the shelf, and it has to be in one of the two locations, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
