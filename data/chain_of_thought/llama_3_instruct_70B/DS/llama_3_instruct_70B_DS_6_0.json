This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\". This tells us that the second option from step 1 (it is ringing in the kitchen) is not true.\n\n3. Since we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and we know that the second option is not true (from step 2), then the only remaining possibility is that the first option is true: \"The phone is in the living room\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
