We are given two statements:\n   - Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\n   - The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: either it's in the box or it's blending in on the floor.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities (blending in on the floor) is not true. This means we can eliminate \"blending in on the floor\" as an option.\n\n4. Since there are only two options, and one has been eliminated, the remaining option must be true: the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
