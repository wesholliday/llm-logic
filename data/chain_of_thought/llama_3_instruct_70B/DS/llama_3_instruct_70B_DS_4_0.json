This implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\". This means that the second option (playing in the bedroom) is not true.\n\n3. Since one of the two options must be true, and the second option is not true, it follows that the first option must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
