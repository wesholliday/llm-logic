This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n2. We also know that \"Fido is not in the garden\". This tells us that the second option (\"Fido is in the garden\") is definitely false.\n3. Since the second option is false, and we know that at least one of the options must be true (from step 1), it means that the first option (\"Fido is inside\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
