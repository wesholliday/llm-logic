This implies that there are only two possible scenarios: the jacket is either on the chair or in the closet.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\". This eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in step 1, which means the jacket cannot be in the closet.\n\n3. Since we know the jacket can't be in the closet (from step 2), and there are only two possible scenarios (from step 1), it must be that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
