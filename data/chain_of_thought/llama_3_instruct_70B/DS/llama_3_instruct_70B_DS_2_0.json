This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The book isn't resting on the table\". This tells us that the second option in the original \"or\" statement is false.\n\n3. Since the second option is false, and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), then the first option must be true. Therefore, the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
