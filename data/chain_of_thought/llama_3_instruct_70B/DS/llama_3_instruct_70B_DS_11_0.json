This implies that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper: the driveway or the porch.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\". This tells us that one of the two possible locations (the porch) can be ruled out.\n\n3. Since we know the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch, and it's not on the porch, the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
