This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\". This tells us that the second option (keys dangling in the cabinet) is not true.\n\n3. Since we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and the second option is not true (from step 2), it means that the first option must be true: \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
