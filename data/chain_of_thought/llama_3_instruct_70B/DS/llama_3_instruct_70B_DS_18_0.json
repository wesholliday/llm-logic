We are given the statement: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\" This implies that there are only two possible locations for the notebook, and one of them must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This tells us that one of the two possible locations (sitting on the nightstand) is not true.\n\n3. Since we know that one of the two possibilities must be true, and sitting on the nightstand is not true, then the only remaining possibility must be true: the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
