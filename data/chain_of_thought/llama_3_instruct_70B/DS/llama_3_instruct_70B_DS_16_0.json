We are given two statements:\n   - Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk (Statement A)\n   - The pen isn't on my desk (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there are only two possible locations for the pen: in the bag or on the desk.\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement B, which tells us that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n4. Since the pen can only be in one of the two locations (bag or desk), and it's not on the desk, we can conclude that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
