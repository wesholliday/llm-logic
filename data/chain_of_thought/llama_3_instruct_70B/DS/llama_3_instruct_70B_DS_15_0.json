We have two statements: \n   a) Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\n   b) The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible scenarios for the shoes' location: either they're in the closet or they're lined up by the door.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities - the shoes being lined up by the door - is not true.\n\n4. Since there are only two options, and we've eliminated one of them, it logically follows that the other option must be true: the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
