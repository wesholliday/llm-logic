We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The watch isn't on his wrist\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A tells us that there are only two possible locations for the watch: either it's charging on the dresser or it's on his wrist.\n\n3. Statement B eliminates one of those possibilities, telling us that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n4. Since we know the watch can't be on his wrist (from Statement B), and there are only two possible locations according to Statement A, the remaining possibility must be true: the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
