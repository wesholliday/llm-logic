We are given two statements:\n   - Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n   - The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the remote control: the coffee table and under the couch.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the remote control is not under the couch. This means we can eliminate \"under the couch\" as a possible location.\n\n4. Since there are only two possible locations (coffee table or under the couch) and one of them has been eliminated, the remaining possibility must be true: the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
