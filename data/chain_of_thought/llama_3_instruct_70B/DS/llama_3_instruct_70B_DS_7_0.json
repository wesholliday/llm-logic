We are given two statements:\n   - Either the umbrella is in the car or it's tucked away in the closet.\n   - The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the umbrella: the car and the closet.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4. Since the umbrella can only be in one of these two locations (car or closet), and it's not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
