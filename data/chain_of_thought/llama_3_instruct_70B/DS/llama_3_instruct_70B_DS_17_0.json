The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack. Therefore, since it can't be on the coat rack, and there are only two possibilities according to statement 1, the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
