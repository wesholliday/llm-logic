We have the statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" which can be represented as:\n   If P (dog is inside), then Q (cat is outside)\n\n2. This implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\n3. Now, we are given the additional information \"The cat was not outside\", which means Q is false.\n\n4. Since Q is false, and we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true (from step 2), it implies that P cannot be true. If P were true, then Q would have to be true as well, but we know Q is false.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
