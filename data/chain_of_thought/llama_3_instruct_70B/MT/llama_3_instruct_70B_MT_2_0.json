            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the second part (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n\n2. We are given the additional information: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. Now, let's think about what this means for the first part of the conditional statement. If the unicorn being in the forest is false, and the conditional statement says that if the griffin is in the forest then the unicorn must be in the forest, then it must be the case that the griffin was not in the forest. Because if the griffin were in the forest, then according to the conditional statement, the unicorn would have to be in the forest too, but we know that's not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
