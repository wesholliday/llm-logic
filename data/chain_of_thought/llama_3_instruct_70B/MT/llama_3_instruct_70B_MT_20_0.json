            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This implies that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow.\n2. We are also given that \"The banana was not yellow\".\n3. Now, let's think about what this means in relation to the original conditional statement. If the banana is not yellow, it means that the condition \"the banana was yellow\" is not satisfied.\n4. Since the condition is not satisfied, we can infer that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement must also be false. In other words, if the apple being red would imply the banana being yellow, but the banana is not yellow, then the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
