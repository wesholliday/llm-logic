We have a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This implies that if the cake is indeed chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n2. We are also given the information: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n3. Now, let's think about what this means in relation to our conditional statement. If the muffins are not blueberry, it means that the condition \"the muffins were blueberry\" is not satisfied.\n4. Since the condition is not satisfied, we can infer that the premise \"the cake was chocolate\" must be false. This is because if the cake were indeed chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry (according to our conditional statement), but they are not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
