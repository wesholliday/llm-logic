            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n\n2. We are also given that \"The book is not a mystery novel\". This means the book does not belong to the category of mystery novels.\n\n3. Now, let's think about what would happen if James had written the book. According to statement 1, if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. But we know from statement 2 that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n4. Therefore, it cannot be the case that James wrote the book, because if he did, the book would be a mystery novel, which contradicts our knowledge that it's not.\n\n5. Hence, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
