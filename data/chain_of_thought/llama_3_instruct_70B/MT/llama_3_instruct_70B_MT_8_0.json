This implies that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake.\n2. We are given the additional information \"The mummy was not awake\".\n3. Since the mummy is not awake, and we know that if the vampire is awake, the mummy would be awake (from step 1), it means that the vampire cannot be awake. If the vampire were awake, the mummy would be awake too, but we know that's not the case.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
