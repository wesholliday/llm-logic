            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". This can be represented as \"B \u2192 W\", where B means \"the bear was in the cave\" and W means \"the wolf was in the den\".\n2. The second statement is \"The wolf was not in the den\", which can be represented as \"\u00acW\" (not W).\n3. Now, let's analyze the implications of these two statements. If B \u2192 W is true, and \u00acW is also true, then it means that the condition \"B\" cannot be true, because if it were, then W would have to be true (by modus ponens), but we know that W is not true.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that B must be false, i.e., \"The bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
