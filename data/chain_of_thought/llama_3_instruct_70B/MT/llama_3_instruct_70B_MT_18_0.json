            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P means \"the doll was plastic\" and M means \"the truck was metal\".\n2. We are also given that \"The truck was not metal\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\" (not M).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\", which would be \"\u00acP\".\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the implications of the given statements:\n\n* If P \u2192 M is true, and \u00acM is also true, then it means that the condition \"P\" (the doll being plastic) cannot be true, because if it were, then M (the truck being metal) would have to be true as well. But we know \u00acM, so P must be false.\n* Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The doll was not plastic\", or \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes",
