            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. We are also given that \"Sue was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (not S).\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of \u00acS on the conditional statement M \u2192 S. If Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acS), then the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n4. Since the conditional statement M \u2192 S implies that if Mary was at the wedding (M), then Sue would have been at the wedding (S), but we know that Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acS), it means that the antecedent \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M) cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Mary was not at the wedding\", represented as \u00acM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
