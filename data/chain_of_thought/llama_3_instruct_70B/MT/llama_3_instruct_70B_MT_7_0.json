We are also given: \"Chris did not finish the race\" (fact)\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditional statement:\n\"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\"\nThis means that if Alex finished the race, it implies that Chris must have finished the race as well.\n\nBut we know that Chris did NOT finish the race (from fact 2). This means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" cannot be true, because if it were, then Chris would have finished the race, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
