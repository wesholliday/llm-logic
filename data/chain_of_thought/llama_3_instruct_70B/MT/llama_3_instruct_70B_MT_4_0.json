The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Now, let's analyze statement 1. It says that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. But we already know that the robot did not visit Jupiter (from statement 2). Therefore, the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" must be false, because if it were true, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, which is not the case.\n\nSo, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
