            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". This implies that if Tom watched football, it necessarily means Jen watched basketball.\n2. We are also given that \"Jen did not watch basketball\".\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that Tom watched football. If Tom watched football, then according to the conditional statement, Jen would have watched basketball. But we know that Jen did not watch basketball.\n4. This creates a contradiction, since if Tom watched football, Jen should have watched basketball, but she didn't.\n5. Therefore, our initial assumption - \"Tom watched football\" - must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
