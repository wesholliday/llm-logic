            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". This negates the consequent (Q) of the original conditional statement.\n3. Using modus tollens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude that if Q is false, and P \u2192 Q, then P must be false.\n\nIn this case, since Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acQ), and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (P \u2192 Q), we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
