Amy did not play tennis.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. But from statement 2, we know that Amy did not play tennis. This means that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" cannot be true, because if it were, then Amy would have played tennis, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
