            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". This can be represented as \"J \u2192 L\", where J represents \"Joe went to the park\" and L represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. The second statement is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\", which can be represented as \"\u00acL\" (not L).\n3. We want to know if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\", which can be represented as \"\u00acJ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf J \u2192 L is true, and \u00acL is also true, then it means that the condition \"J\" cannot be true, because if it were, then L would have to be true (by the conditional statement), but we know that L is not true.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that J is false, which means Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
