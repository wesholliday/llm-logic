This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"Bob did not choose pasta\". This tells us that the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" is actually false.\n\n3. Now, let's think about what this means for the original conditional statement. If the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" is false, and the conditional statement says that if Sue chose pizza then Bob chose pasta, then it must be the case that the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is also false. Because if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta (according to the conditional statement), but we know that's not true.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
