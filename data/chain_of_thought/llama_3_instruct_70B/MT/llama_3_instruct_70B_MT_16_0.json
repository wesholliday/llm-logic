The pants were not denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. But from statement 2, we know that the pants are not denim. This means that the condition \"the shirt is cotton\" cannot be true, because if it were, the pants would have to be denim, which they are not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
