This implies that if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad.\n2. We are also given that \"Kate did not eat the salad\".\n3. Now, let's think about what this means for Ben eating pasta. If Ben had eaten pasta, then according to the conditional statement, Kate would have eaten the salad. But we know Kate didn't eat the salad.\n4. Therefore, it must be the case that Ben did not eat pasta, because if he had, Kate would have eaten the salad (which she didn't).\n\nAnswer: yes",
