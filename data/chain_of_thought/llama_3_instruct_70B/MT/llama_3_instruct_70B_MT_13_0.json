            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This implies that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue.\n2. We are also given that \"The truck was not blue.\"\n3. Now, let's think about what this means in relation to our initial conditional statement. If the truck is not blue, it means that the condition \"the truck was blue\" is not satisfied.\n4. Since the condition is not satisfied, we can infer that the premise \"the car was red\" must also be false. This is because if the car were indeed red, then the truck would have been blue (according to our initial conditional statement), but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
