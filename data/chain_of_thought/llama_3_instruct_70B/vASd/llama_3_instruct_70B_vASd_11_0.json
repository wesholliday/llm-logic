However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - doing hard labor - and still claims that you won't be tired.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it ignores the potential effect of doing hard labor on one's level of tiredness. Hard labor can cause fatigue, regardless of how much sleep you get. Therefore, it's possible to get enough sleep and still be tired if you do hard labor.\n\nIn other words, the premise only guarantees that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness in the absence of other factors that might cause tiredness. The conclusion, however, tries to extend this guarantee to a situation where an additional factor (hard labor) is present, which can negate the effect of getting enough sleep.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
