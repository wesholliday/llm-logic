However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - \"it has been soaked in water\" - which is not present in the premise.\n\nIn general, adding new conditions to a statement can change its truth value. In this case, soaking a match in water would likely prevent it from lighting even if it's struck. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
