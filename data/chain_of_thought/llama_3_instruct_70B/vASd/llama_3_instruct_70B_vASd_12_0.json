However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - \"my computer catches on fire\" - which seems unrelated to the original premise.\n\nIn logic, we need to ensure that the conclusion follows logically and necessarily from the premises. In this case, the added condition \"my computer catches on fire\" actually makes it impossible to play video games (since the computer is on fire!). This contradicts the original premise, which implies that finishing homework allows playing video games.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise. The added condition in the conclusion introduces a contradictory scenario that undermines the original claim.\n\nAnswer: no",
