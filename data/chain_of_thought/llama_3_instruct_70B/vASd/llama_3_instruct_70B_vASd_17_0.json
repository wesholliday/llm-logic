However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - \"the transmission is shot\" - which is not mentioned in the premise.\n\nIf the transmission is shot, it's likely that the car will not run smoothly, regardless of whether the oil has been changed or not. The premise does not account for this additional factor, and therefore, we cannot logically conclude that changing the oil and having a shot transmission will result in the car running smoothly.\n\nIn fact, the conclusion contradicts our intuitive understanding of how cars work. If the transmission is shot, it's likely to cause problems with the car's performance, regardless of the oil condition.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
