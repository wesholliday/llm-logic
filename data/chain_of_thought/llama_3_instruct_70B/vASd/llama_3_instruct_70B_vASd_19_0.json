However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - \"there is a hole in it\" - which could potentially affect the outcome.\n\nWith a hole in the gas tank, it's likely that the gas would leak out, making it impossible for the car to run. The premise doesn't account for this scenario, and the added condition in the conclusion undermines the original claim.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it ignores the potential impact of the additional condition (the hole in the gas tank) on the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
