However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - eating junk food - which might actually hinder weight loss.\n\nLogically, we can't conclude that exercising and eating junk food will lead to weight loss simply because exercising alone leads to weight loss. The addition of eating junk food could negate or reduce the weight-loss effect of exercising.\n\nIn other words, the premise only guarantees weight loss if I exercise, but it doesn't account for the potential negative impact of eating junk food on weight loss. Therefore, we can't logically infer that exercising and eating junk food will lead to weight loss.\n\nAnswer: no",
