    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

If Democrats don't gain the most new voters, then Republicans or Libertarians must gain the most (since they are the only major parties).\n3. Republicans are more likely to gain new voters than Libertarians.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that Democrats are likely to gain the most new voters. Therefore, it is unlikely that Democrats won't gain the most new voters.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Democrats don't gain the most new voters. In this case, either Republicans or Libertarians must gain the most new voters (point 2). However, we know that Republicans are more likely to gain new voters than Libertarians (point 3).\n\nSo, if Democrats don't gain the most new voters, it is more likely that Republicans will gain the most new voters rather than Libertarians.\n\nAnswer: no",
