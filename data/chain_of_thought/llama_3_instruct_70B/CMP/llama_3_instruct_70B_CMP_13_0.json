    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs.\n2. Georgia is expected to be second in job growth, closely following Tennessee.\n3. Missouri's growth is significantly lower than both Tennessee and Georgia.\n4. If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. This implies that if neither Tennessee nor Georgia adds the most jobs, Missouri must be the one adding the most jobs.\n5. Since Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, it's likely that Georgia won't.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will?\n\nIf Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then according to point 4, either Georgia or Missouri must be adding the most jobs. However, we know from point 2 that Georgia is expected to be second in job growth, closely following Tennessee. This means that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it's more likely that Georgia will take the lead rather than Missouri.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: no",
