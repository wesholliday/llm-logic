    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. A minimum wage hike is most probable.\n2. Paid family leave is less probable than a minimum wage hike but more probable than student loan forgiveness.\n3. If paid family leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n4. A minimum wage hike likely will happen, and hence paid leave likely won't happen.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that a minimum wage hike is the most probable outcome. From point 4, we know that since a minimum wage hike is likely to happen, paid family leave is unlikely to happen.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where a minimum wage hike doesn't happen. In this case, according to point 3, if paid family leave also doesn't happen, then loan forgiveness will happen. But we already know from point 4 that paid family leave is unlikely to happen since a minimum wage hike is likely to happen. Therefore, in the scenario where a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it's likely that paid family leave won't happen either.\n\nSo, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it's likely that loan forgiveness will happen because paid family leave is also unlikely to happen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
