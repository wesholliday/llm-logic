    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. Industry analysis expects Ford to sell the most vehicles this year.\n2. Toyota is expected to be close behind Ford in sales.\n3. Honda is expected to lag significantly behind both Ford and Toyota.\n4. If Toyota isn't #1 in sales, then if Ford isn't, Honda will be. This implies that if neither Ford nor Toyota leads in sales, Honda must lead.\n5. Ford likely will lead in sales (based on industry analysis).\n6. Hence, Toyota likely won't lead in sales.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will?\n\nIf Ford doesn't lead in sales, then either Toyota or Honda must lead. However, we know that Toyota is expected to be close behind Ford in sales, and Honda is expected to lag significantly behind both. Therefore, it's more likely that Toyota would lead in sales if Ford doesn't, rather than Honda.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
