    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

England has a much lower chance of winning compared to Spain and Brazil.\n4. If Brazil doesn't win, then if Spain doesn't win, England will win (i.e., if neither Brazil nor Spain wins, England must win).\n5. It is likely that Spain will win, which implies that it is unlikely that Brazil will win.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Is it likely that, if Spain doesn't win, England will?\n\nIf Spain doesn't win, there are two possible scenarios:\n\na) Brazil wins\nb) Neither Brazil nor Spain wins (in which case England must win, according to point 4)\n\nSince Brazil has a close second-highest chance of winning, scenario (a) is more likely than scenario (b). Therefore, if Spain doesn't win, it's more probable that Brazil will win instead of England.\n\nAnswer: no",
