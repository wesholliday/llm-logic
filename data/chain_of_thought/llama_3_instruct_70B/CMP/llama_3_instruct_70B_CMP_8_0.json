    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

Russia's growth rate lags distantly behind both India and China.\n4. If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that India is likely to grow the fastest. From point 2, we know that China is close behind. This means that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, it's likely that China will be.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"if India isn\u2019t the top- growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\" This statement implies that if India doesn't grow the fastest, then Russia will. However, we know from point 2 that China is close behind India, so it's more likely that China will grow faster than Russia.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it does not follow that if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\n\nAnswer: no",
