    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n2. Tea is likely to be second in retaining morning drinkers, with soda being consumed much less.\n3. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. (This implies that if coffee and tea don't retain the most morning drinkers, soda must.)\n4. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, so tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?\n\nFrom point 3, we know that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers and coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Since tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers (point 4), the condition \"if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers\" is already satisfied.\n\nSo, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, we can conclude that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
