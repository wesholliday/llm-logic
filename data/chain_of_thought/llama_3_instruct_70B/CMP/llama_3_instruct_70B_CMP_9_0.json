    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. Apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year.\n2. Bananas are closely behind apples in sales.\n3. Oranges trail distantly behind bananas in sales.\n4. If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be. (This implies that if bananas and apples aren't the top sellers, oranges must be.)\n5. It's likely apples will be top, hence bananas won't be.\n\nFrom point 1, we know apples are likely to be the top seller. From point 5, we know that if apples are likely to be top, then bananas won't be. This means that if apples aren't the top seller, there is a possibility that bananas could be.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where apples aren't the top-selling fruit. In this case, we know from point 4 that if bananas aren't the top seller either, oranges will be. However, we also know that bananas are closely behind apples in sales (point 2), so it's possible that bananas could be the top seller instead.\n\nGiven these possibilities, we can't conclude that it is likely that, if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. There is still a chance that bananas could be the top seller instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
