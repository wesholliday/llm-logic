    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. Uber is likely to have the most rides this month.\n2. If Uber doesn't have the most rides, then taxis will (since Lyft and taxis are the only other options).\n3. It's unlikely that Lyft will have the most rides (because Uber is likely to have the most).\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will?\"\n\nIf Uber doesn't give the most rides, then either Lyft or taxis must give the most rides. But we know that Lyft is unlikely to give the most rides (from point 3). Therefore, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, it's likely that taxis will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
