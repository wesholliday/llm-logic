We are given two statements:\n   - \"The clug is not snugged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the clug is not snugged, then it is fleeked\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can use modus ponens with Statement A and our rewritten Statement B:\n   - The clug is not snugged (given)\n   - If the clug is not snugged, then it is fleeked (rewritten Statement B)\n   - Therefore, the clug is fleeked (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: yes",
