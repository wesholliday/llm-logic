We are given two statements:\n   - \"The zinger is not smoogled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the zinger is not smoogled, then it is fraggled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can combine Statement A with our rewritten Statement B:\n   - \"The zinger is not smoogled\" (given)\n   - \"If the zinger is not smoogled, then it is fraggled\" (rewritten Statement B)\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude: \n   - \"The zinger is fraggled\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
