We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sneg is not sproted\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the sneg is not sproted, then it is crampled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can use modus tollens with Statement A and our rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the sneg is not sproted (given), \n   - and if the sneg is not sproted, then it is crampled (rewritten Statement B),\n   - therefore, the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
