We are given two statements:\n   - \"The shank is not nugged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the shank is not nugged, then it is plooked\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we have Statement A, which says the shank is not nugged.\n\n4. Combining Statement A with our rewritten Statement B, we can conclude that if the shank is not nugged (which it's not), then it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
