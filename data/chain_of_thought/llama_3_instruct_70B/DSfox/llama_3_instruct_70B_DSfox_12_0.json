We are given two statements:\n   - \"The smip is not lupped\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement B, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - The smip is lupped\n   - The smip is shripped\n\n3. However, Statement A tells us that the first possibility (\"The smip is lupped\") is not true.\n\n4. Therefore, since one of the two possibilities must be true (according to Statement B), and \"The smip is lupped\" is not true, we can conclude that the other possibility (\"The smip is shripped\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
