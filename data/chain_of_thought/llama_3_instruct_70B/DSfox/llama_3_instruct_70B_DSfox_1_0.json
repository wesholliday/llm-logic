From the first statement, we know that the flugel is not zargled.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement: 'Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed'. This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. \n\n4. Since we know from step 2 that the flugel is not zargled, the only way for the second statement to be true is if 'it is blimmed' is true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
