We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat is not quanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the splat is not quanked, then it is morphed\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we have Statement A, which says \"The splat is not quanked\". This matches the condition in our rewritten Statement B.\n\n4. Therefore, according to Statement B, if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
