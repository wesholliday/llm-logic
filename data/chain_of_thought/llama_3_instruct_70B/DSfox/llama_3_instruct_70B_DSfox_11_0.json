We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flug is not zimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that the flug is not zimmed.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It says that either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed. Since we already know from Statement A that the flug is not zimmed, the only other possibility left is that the flug is blummed.\n\n4. Therefore, combining the information from both statements, we can infer that the flug is indeed blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
