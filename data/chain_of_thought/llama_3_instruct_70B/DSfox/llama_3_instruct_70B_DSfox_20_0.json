We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg is not surned\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that the fleeg is not surned.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It says that either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered. Since we already know from Statement A that the fleeg is not surned, the only other possibility left is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\n4. Therefore, combining the information from both statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
