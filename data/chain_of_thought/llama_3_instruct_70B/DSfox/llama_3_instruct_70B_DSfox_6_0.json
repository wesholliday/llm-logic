The second statement is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n3. Since we know that \"The grommet is not plopped\", the first option in the \"or\" statement is false.\n4. Therefore, the only way for the \"or\" statement to be true is if the second option, \"it is sploffed\", is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
