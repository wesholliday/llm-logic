We are given two statements:\n   - \"The dreb is not spened\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that the dreb is not spened.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It says that either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed. Since we already know from Statement A that the dreb is not spened, the only other possibility left is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\n4. Therefore, combining the information from both statements, we can infer that the dreb is indeed vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
