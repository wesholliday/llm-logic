We have two statements:\n   - \"The smonk is not plagged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as:\n   - \"If the smonk is not plagged, then it is vreebled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we have Statement A: \"The smonk is not plagged\". This matches the condition in our rewritten Statement B.\n\n4. Therefore, using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude that:\n   - \"The smonk is vreebled\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
