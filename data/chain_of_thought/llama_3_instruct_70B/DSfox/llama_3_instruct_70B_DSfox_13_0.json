We are given two statements:\n   - \"The glip is not tragged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the glip is not tragged, then it is slogged\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can combine Statement A with our rewritten Statement B:\n   - \"The glip is not tragged\" (given)\n   - \"If the glip is not tragged, then it is slogged\" (rewritten from given)\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude: \n   - \"The glip is slogged\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
