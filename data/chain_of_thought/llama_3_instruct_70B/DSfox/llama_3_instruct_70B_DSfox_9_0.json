We are given two statements:\n   - \"The twonk is not plinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the twonk is not plinked, then it is varnished\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we have Statement A, which says \"The twonk is not plinked\". This matches the condition in our rewritten Statement B.\n\n4. Therefore, according to Statement B, if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
