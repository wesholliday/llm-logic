We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flob is not movated\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we have Statement A, which says \"The flob is not movated\". This matches the condition in our rewritten Statement B.\n\n4. Therefore, according to Statement B, if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
