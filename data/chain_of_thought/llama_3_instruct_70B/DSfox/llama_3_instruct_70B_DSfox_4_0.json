We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fribble is not crinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as a logical OR operation: \n   The fribble is crinked \u2228 The fribble is snurgled\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"The fribble is not crinked\", which means the first part of the OR operation in Statement B is false.\n\n4. Since the OR operation requires only one of its parts to be true for the entire statement to be true, and the first part is false, the second part must be true for Statement B to hold.\n\n5. Therefore, \"The fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
