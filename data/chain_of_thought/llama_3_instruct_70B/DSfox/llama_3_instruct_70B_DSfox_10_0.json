From the first statement, we know that the wug is not garpled.\n\n3. The second statement says that either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged. Since we already know that the wug is not garpled (from step 2), this means that the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
