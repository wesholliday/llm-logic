We are given two statements:\n   - \"The whiffle is not tinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked\" (using the rule of material implication).\n\n3. Now, we know from Statement A that \"The whiffle is not tinked\". \n\n4. Using modus ponens on the rewritten Statement B and Statement A, we can conclude: \"The whiffle is shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
