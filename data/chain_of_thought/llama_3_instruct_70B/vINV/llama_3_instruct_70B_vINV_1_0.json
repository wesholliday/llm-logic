            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (p \u2192 q)\n\nConclusion: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding (~p \u2192 ~q)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nFrom the premise, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This seems to be saying that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is false, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be false.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily true. The premise only guarantees that if Mary is present, Sue will be present, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is absent. There could be other reasons why Sue might still be present even if Mary is not.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
