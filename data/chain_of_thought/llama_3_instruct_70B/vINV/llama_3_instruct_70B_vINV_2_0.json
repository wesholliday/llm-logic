The premise states that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, this does not necessarily imply that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn must also not be in the forest.\n\nIn fact, there could be scenarios where the griffin is not in the forest, but the unicorn still is. For example, maybe the unicorn was always in the forest, regardless of the griffin's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest, based solely on the premise provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
