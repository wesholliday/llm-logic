            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (p \u2192 q)\n\nConclusion: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~p \u2192 ~q)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. This implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It says that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is essentially the contrapositive of the original premise.\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" (p \u2192 q) is \"if not q, then not p\" (~q \u2192 ~p). The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are given the premise \"if p, then q\" and asked if it implies the conclusion \"if not p, then not q\". This is not exactly the same as the contrapositive. Instead, it's a related but distinct logical operation called the inverse.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" (p \u2192 q) is \"if not p, then not q\" (~p \u2192 ~q). Unlike the contrapositive, the inverse is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this specific case, we cannot conclude that the argument is logically valid solely based on the premise. There might be scenarios where Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt, but Mark still buys the blue shirt, violating the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
