            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: J \u2192 M (where J means \"the book was written by James\" and M means \"the book is a mystery novel\")\n\nConclusion: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: ~J \u2192 ~M (where ~ denotes negation)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument. The premise states that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily imply that if James did not write the book, it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nTo see why, consider an example: suppose John writes mystery novels, and James does not. In this case, the premise is still true (if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel), but the conclusion would be false (~J \u2192 ~M would imply that if James did not write the book, it cannot be a mystery novel, which is not necessarily true).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
