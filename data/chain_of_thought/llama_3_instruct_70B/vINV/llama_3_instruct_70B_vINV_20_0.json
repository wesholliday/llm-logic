            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (p \u2192 q)\nConclusion: If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow (~p \u2192 ~q)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This implies a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It says that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. This seems to be saying that the absence of redness in the apple guarantees the absence of yellowness in the banana.\n\nHowever, the premise only establishes a connection between the presence of redness in the apple and the presence of yellowness in the banana. It does not provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\nIn other words, the premise does not imply that if the apple is not red, then the banana must be not yellow. There could be cases where the apple is not red, but the banana is still yellow.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
