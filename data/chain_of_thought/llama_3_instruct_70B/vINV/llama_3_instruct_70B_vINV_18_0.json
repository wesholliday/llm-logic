            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (P \u2192 M)\nConclusion: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal (~P \u2192 ~M)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nFrom the premise, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This implies a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck must not be metal. This seems to be a contrapositive statement, which is a valid inference in logic.\n\nIn fact, we can derive the conclusion from the premise using the rule of contraposition:\n\nP \u2192 M (premise)\n~M \u2192 ~P (contrapositive of the premise)\n~P \u2192 ~M (conclusion)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically and necessarily from the premise, this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
