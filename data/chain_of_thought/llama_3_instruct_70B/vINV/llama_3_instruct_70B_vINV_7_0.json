This implies a conditional relationship between Alex finishing and Chris finishing.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the premise: If Alex did not finish the race (~p). We want to determine if this implies that Chris did not finish the race (~q).\n\nNotice that the premise only tells us about the situation where Alex finishes the race. It does not provide any information about what happens when Alex does not finish the race. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nIn other words, the premise does not provide enough information to guarantee the truth of the conclusion. There might be cases where Alex does not finish the race, but Chris still finishes the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
