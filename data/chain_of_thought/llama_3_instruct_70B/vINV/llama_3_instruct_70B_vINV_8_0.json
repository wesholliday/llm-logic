            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\nThis can be represented as: V \u2192 M (where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\")\n\nConclusion: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\nThis can be represented as: \u00acV \u2192 \u00acM (where \u00acV represents \"the vampire was not awake\" and \u00acM represents \"the mummy was not awake\")\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument. The premise states that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. This implies a connection between the two, where the vampire's wakefulness guarantees the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nThe conclusion, however, is trying to infer that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is also not awake. But this doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only tells us about the situation when the vampire is awake, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nIn other words, just because the vampire's wakefulness implies the mummy's wakefulness, it doesn't mean that the vampire's non-wakefulness implies the mummy's non-wakefulness. There could be cases where the vampire is not awake, but the mummy still is.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
