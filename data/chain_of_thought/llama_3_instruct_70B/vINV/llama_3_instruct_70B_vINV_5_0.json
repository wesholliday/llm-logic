This implies a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nThe conclusion, however, is trying to infer a new conditional relationship: if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. But this is not necessarily true based on the original premise.\n\nIn fact, we can imagine a scenario where Jeff didn't play basketball, but Amy still played tennis. The original premise only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis; it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
