Specifically, we can use the rule of contraposition, which states that if p \u2192 q is true, then ~q \u2192 ~p is also true.\n\nIn our case, the premise p \u2192 q implies that if the alien visited Mars (p), then the robot visited Jupiter (q). Using contraposition, we can infer that if the robot did not visit Jupiter (~q), then the alien did not visit Mars (~p).\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion ~p \u2192 ~q. This statement says that if the alien did not visit Mars (~p), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (~q). But this is exactly what we inferred using contraposition!\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
