We have two statements:\n   - \"The wug might not be bimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there's a possibility the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B:\n   - It says either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\n   - If the wug is not bimmed (which is possible according to Statement A), then the only other option left is that the wug is flooped.\n\n4. Therefore, considering both statements together, we can infer that if the wug might not be bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
