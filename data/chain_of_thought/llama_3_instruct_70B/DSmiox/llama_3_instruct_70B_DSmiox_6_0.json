We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet might not be plopped\" (which means it's possible that the grommet is not plopped)\n   - \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"The grommet might not be plopped\". This means there's a possibility that the grommet is not plopped.\n\n4. If the grommet is not plopped (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be sploffed.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
