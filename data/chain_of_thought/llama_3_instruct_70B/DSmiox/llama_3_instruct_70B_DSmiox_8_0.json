We have two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there's a possibility the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B:\n   - It says either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\n   - Since we know from Statement A that the sprocket might not be daggled (there's a possibility), \n     then the only other option left is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\n4. Therefore, combining the information from both statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
