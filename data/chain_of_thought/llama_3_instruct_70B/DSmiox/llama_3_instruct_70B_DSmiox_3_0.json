We have two statements:\n   - \"The splat might not be quanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B:\n   - It says either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n   - If the splat is not quanked (as inferred from Statement A), then the only other option left is that the splat is morphed.\n\n4. Therefore, combining the information from both statements, we can infer that if the splat might not be quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
