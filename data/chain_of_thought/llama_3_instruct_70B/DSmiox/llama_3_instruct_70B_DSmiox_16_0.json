We have two statements:\n   - \"The sneg might not be sproted\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement A tells us that there's a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n3. Statement B gives us two options: either the sneg is crampled, or it must be sproted. This implies that if the sneg is not sproted (which is possible according to statement A), then it must be crampled.\n\n4. Therefore, combining the information from statements A and B, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
