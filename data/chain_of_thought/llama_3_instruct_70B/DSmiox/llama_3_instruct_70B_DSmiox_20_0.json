We have two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg might not be surned\" ( Statement A )\n   - \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" ( Statement B )\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there's a possibility that the fleeg is not surned.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B:\n   - It says either the fleeg is bluttered OR it must be surned.\n   - Since we know from Statement A that the fleeg might not be surned, this means the \"it must be surned\" part of Statement B cannot be true (because there's a possibility it's not surned).\n   - Therefore, the only remaining option in Statement B is that \"the fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
