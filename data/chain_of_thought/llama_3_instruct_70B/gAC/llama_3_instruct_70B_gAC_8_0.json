This implies a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n2. We are also given that \"The mummy was awake\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake (given condition).\n* The mummy is indeed awake (given fact).\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that the vampire was awake. There might be other reasons why the mummy is awake, unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where the mummy is awake due to some external factor, but the vampire is still asleep. In this case, the condition \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" would not be triggered, yet the mummy is still awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
