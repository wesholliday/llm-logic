This can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race\".\n2. We are also given that \"Chris finished the race\" is true, which means C is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if it follows that \"Alex finished the race\" (A) is true.\n\nFrom step 1, we know that A \u2192 C is true. This means that if A is true, then C must also be true. But we already know that C is true (from step 2). So, we can conclude that A must be true as well, because if it weren't, then C wouldn't be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Alex finished the race\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
