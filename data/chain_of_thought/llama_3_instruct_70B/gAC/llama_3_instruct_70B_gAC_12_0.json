But this doesn't necessarily mean that Joe actually went to the park.\n\nJust because Lucy went to the zoo (statement 2), it doesn't guarantee that Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We can't conclude that Joe went to the park just because Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
