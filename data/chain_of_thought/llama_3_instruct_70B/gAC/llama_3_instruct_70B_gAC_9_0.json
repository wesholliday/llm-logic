But this doesn't necessarily mean that if Mark buys the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, just because Mark buying the blue shirt is a consequence of Lisa buying the red shirt, it doesn't imply that Lisa buying the red shirt is a necessary condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
