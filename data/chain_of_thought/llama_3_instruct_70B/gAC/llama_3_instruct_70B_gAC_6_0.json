It says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Since we already know that Bob chose pasta (from statement 2), it seems like we can conclude that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nHowever, this is where we need to be careful. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would choose pasta. It does not guarantee the converse: that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nIn other words, there could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice. For example, maybe Bob just really likes pasta!\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue chose pizza simply because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
