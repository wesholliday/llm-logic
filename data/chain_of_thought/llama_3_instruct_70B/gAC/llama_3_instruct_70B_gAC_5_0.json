It says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since we already know that Amy played tennis (from statement 2), this implies that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" might be true, but it doesn't necessarily mean it is true.\n\nIn other words, just because Amy played tennis, it doesn't automatically follow that Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
