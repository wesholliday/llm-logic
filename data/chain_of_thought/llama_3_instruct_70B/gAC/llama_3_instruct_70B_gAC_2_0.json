The conditional statement only guarantees that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would be too. It does not provide any information about the griffin's presence when the unicorn is present.\n\nIn other words, just because the unicorn was in the forest, it doesn't automatically imply that the griffin was also there.\n\nAnswer: no",
