            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (conditional statement)\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" (true statement)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too. This implies a causal relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nNow, we are told that statement 2 is true, which means Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nThe question asks whether it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nHere's the crucial part: just because Sue was at the wedding (statement 2), it doesn't necessarily mean Mary was also there. The conditional statement (1) only guarantees that if Mary was present, then Sue would be too, but it doesn't provide any information about Mary's presence when Sue is present.\n\nIn other words, we can have a situation where Sue attended the wedding without Mary being there. For example, maybe Sue came with someone else or decided to attend on her own.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
