We have two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\" (\u00acFC, where FC means \"the fribble must be crinked\")\n   - \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\" (FC \u2228 S, where S means \"it is snurgled\")\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that the fribble does not have to be crinked.\n3. The second premise presents an either-or situation: either FC or S must be true.\n4. Since we know \u00acFC from the first premise, the only option left for the second premise is S (it is snurgled).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The fribble is snurgled\" (S).\n\nAnswer: yes",
