We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" (which can be rewritten as \"The grommet does not have to be plopped\")\n   - \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that there are only two possible scenarios: \n   - The grommet must be plopped\n   - It is sploffed\n\n3. However, the first statement tells us that the first scenario (\"The grommet must be plopped\") is not true.\n\n4. Therefore, since the first scenario is eliminated, we are left with only one possible scenario: \n   - It is sploffed\n\nAnswer: yes",
