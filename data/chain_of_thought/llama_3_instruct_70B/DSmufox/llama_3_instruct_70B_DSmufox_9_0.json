We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\" (which can be rewritten as \"The twonk does not have to be plinked\")\n   - \"Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the twonk doesn't necessarily need to be plinked.\n\n3. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished. \n\n4. Since we already know from the first statement that the twonk doesn't have to be plinked, the only other possibility left is that \"it is varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
