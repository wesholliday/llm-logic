We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" (which can be rewritten as \"The sprocket does not have to be daggled\")\n   - \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that being daggled is not a requirement for the sprocket.\n\n3. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the sprocket must be daggled (which we now know is not the case) or it is cranked.\n\n4. Since the first option (\"the sprocket must be daggled\") is ruled out, we are left with the second option: \"it is cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
