We have two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" (\u00acZ, where Z means \"the flugel must be zargled\")\n   - \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\" (Z \u2228 B, where B means \"it is blimmed\")\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that Z is false (\u00acZ).\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second premise: Z \u2228 B. Since Z is false (\u00acZ), the only way for Z \u2228 B to be true is if B is true.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that B (\"it is blimmed\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
