We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" (i.e., \u00acQ, where Q means \"the splat must be quanked\")\n   - \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" (i.e., Q \u2228 M, where M means \"it is morphed\")\n\n2. We can rewrite the second statement using a logical equivalence: Q \u2228 M \u2261 \u00acQ \u2192 M\n\n3. Now we have:\n   - \u00acQ\n   - \u00acQ \u2192 M\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a valid inference rule), we can infer M from \u00acQ and \u00acQ \u2192 M.\n\nAnswer: yes",
