We have two premises:\n   - It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked (\u00acT, where T means \"the whiffle must be tinked\")\n   - Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked (T \u2228 S, where S means \"it is shanked\")\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that the whiffle must not be tinked.\n3. Now, let's look at the second premise: T \u2228 S. Since \u00acT (the whiffle must not be tinked), the only way for T \u2228 S to be true is if S is true (it is shanked).\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle is indeed shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
