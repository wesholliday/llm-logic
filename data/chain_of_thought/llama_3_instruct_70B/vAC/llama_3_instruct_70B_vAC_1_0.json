            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"Sue was at the wedding\" (q)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was at the wedding\" (p)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding as well. However, just because Sue was at the wedding (premise 2), it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was also there. There could be other reasons why Sue attended the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nIn other words, the argument is committing a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" It assumes that because the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is true, the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
