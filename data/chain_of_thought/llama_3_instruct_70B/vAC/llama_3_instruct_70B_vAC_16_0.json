            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants were denim\".\n2. The second premise is \"The pants were denim\", which can be represented as simply \"D\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The shirt was cotton\", which can be represented as \"C\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if C is true, then D must also be true (C \u2192 D).\nFrom the second premise, we know that D is indeed true.\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that C is true. There could be other reasons why D is true, unrelated to C.\n\nIn other words, just because we know D is true, it doesn't logically follow that C must be true. We need more information to conclude that C is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is NOT logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
