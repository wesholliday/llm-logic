The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. But this does not necessarily mean that only James can write mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, this information alone does not provide conclusive evidence about who the author is.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"The book was written by James\" based on these two statements. Unfortunately, we cannot make such an inference with certainty. There might be other authors who wrote the mystery novel, and we have no additional information to rule them out.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
