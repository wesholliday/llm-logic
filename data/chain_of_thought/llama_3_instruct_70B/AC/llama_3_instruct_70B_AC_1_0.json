Sue was at the wedding (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too. But this doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2, which tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding. However, this fact alone does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nThe key point here is that the conditional statement (1) only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary was present, but it doesn't work the other way around. Just because Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary must have been there too.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
