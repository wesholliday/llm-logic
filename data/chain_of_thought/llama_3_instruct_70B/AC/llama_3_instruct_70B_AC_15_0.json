Erin took a train (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. But the converse is not necessarily true: just because Erin took a train, it doesn't mean Sam took a plane.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Erin takes a train.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that Sam took a plane simply because Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
