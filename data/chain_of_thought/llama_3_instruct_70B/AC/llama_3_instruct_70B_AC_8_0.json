The mummy was awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are told explicitly that the mummy was awake (statement 2). But we can't conclude from this alone that the vampire was awake. The mummy being awake only tells us that one of the conditions for the vampire to be awake is met, but it doesn't guarantee that the vampire is indeed awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
