Mark bought the blue shirt (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark will buy the blue shirt. But it doesn't necessarily mean that if Mark buys the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequence is true but the condition is unknown or false.\n\nGiven statement 2, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, but this fact alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided statements, we cannot infer with certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
