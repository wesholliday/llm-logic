Chris finished the race (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. But this doesn't necessarily mean that Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2, which tells us that Chris indeed finished the race. However, this fact alone does not provide any direct information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nThe conditional statement (1) only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris would have finished too. But it doesn't work the other way around; just because Chris finished, we can't conclude that Alex must have finished as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Alex finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: no",
