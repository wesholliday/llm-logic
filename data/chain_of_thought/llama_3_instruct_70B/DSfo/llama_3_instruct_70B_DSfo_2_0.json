            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The book isn't resting on the table\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"The book is resting on the table OR the book is on the shelf\". This is a logical OR operation, meaning that if either of the conditions is true, then the entire statement is true.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement A: \"The book isn't resting on the table\". This means that the condition \"the book is resting on the table\" is false.\n\n4. Going back to statement B, we know that one of the two conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true (because it's a logical OR operation). Since \"the book is resting on the table\" is false (from statement A), the only way for statement B to remain true is if \"the book is on the shelf\" is true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
