We are given two statements:\n   - \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It says that either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. Since we already know from Statement A that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, the only other possibility left is that the phone is in the living room.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the phone is indeed in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
