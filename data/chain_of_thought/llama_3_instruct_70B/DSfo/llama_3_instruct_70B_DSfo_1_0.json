The second statement is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the options must be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that 'Fido is not in the garden', it cannot be the case that Fido is in the garden.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the second statement, the only remaining option is that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
