We are given two statements:\n   - \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box\". This is because \"either...or\" implies that if one option is not true, the other option must be true.\n\n3. Now, we know from statement A that \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\". \n\n4. Using our rewritten version of statement B, we can conclude that since the toy is not sitting on the shelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
