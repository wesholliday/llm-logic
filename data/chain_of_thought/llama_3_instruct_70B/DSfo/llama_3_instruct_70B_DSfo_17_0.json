We are given two statements:\n   - The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n   - Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n3. Now, let's examine the second statement: \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true. \n\n4. Since we know from step 2 that the scarf isn't on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
