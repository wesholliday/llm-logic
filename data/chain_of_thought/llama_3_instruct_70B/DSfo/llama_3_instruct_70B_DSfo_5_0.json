We have two statements:\n   - \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it presents two possibilities:\n   - The cookies are hidden in the pantry\n   - The cookies are in the jar\n\n3. Now, let's consider statement A: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\". This tells us that the first possibility presented in statement B is false.\n\n4. Since statement B says \"either-or\", and we know the first option (cookies in the pantry) is false, it means the second option must be true: The cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
