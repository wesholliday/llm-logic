We are given two statements:\n   - \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair\". This is because \"either...or\" implies that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\n3. Now, we know from Statement A that \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\". \n\n4. Using our rewritten version of Statement B, we can conclude that since the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
