We are given two statements:\n   - \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that these are the only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece.\n\n3. Since Statement A tells us the puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, we can eliminate this option from Statement B.\n\n4. As a result, the only remaining possibility is that \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
