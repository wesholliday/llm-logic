We are given two statements:\n   - \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an \"either-or\" situation, implying that only one of the options can be true.\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4. Since the umbrella isn't in the closet and Statement B says it's either in the closet or in the car, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
