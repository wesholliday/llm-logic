We have two statements:\n   - \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it presents two possibilities: \n   - The keys are dangling in the cabinet\n   - The keys are in the drawer\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A, which tells us that the first possibility (\"The keys are dangling in the cabinet\") is not true.\n\n4. Since Statement B says \"either-or\" and one of those options (keys dangling in the cabinet) is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true: \n   - The keys are in the drawer\n\nAnswer: yes",
