We are given two statements:\n   - \"The pen isn't on my desk\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It says that either of two conditions must be true: \n   - The pen is on my desk\n   - The pen is in my bag\n\n4. Since we already know from Statement A that the first condition (the pen being on my desk) is false, the only possibility left is that the second condition (the pen being in my bag) must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
