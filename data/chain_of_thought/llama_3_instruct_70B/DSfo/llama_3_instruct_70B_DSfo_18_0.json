            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer\". This is because \"either...or\" implies that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\n3. Now, we know from statement A that \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\". \n\n4. Using our rewritten version of statement B, we can conclude that since the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand (from statement A), it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
