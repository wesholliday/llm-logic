We are given two statements:\n   - \"The watch isn't on his wrist\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that only one of the two options can be true.\n\n3. Since Statement A tells us that the watch isn't on his wrist, we can eliminate this option from Statement B.\n\n4. As a result, the only remaining possibility is that \"the watch is charging on the dresser\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
