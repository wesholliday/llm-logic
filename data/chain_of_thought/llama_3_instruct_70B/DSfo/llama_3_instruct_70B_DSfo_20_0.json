            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   - \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it presents two possible scenarios: \n   - The sunglasses are perched on her head\n   - The sunglasses are in her bag\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A, which tells us that the first scenario (\"The sunglasses are perched on her head\") is not true.\n\n4. Since the first scenario is false, and we have an \"either-or\" statement, it means the second scenario must be true to satisfy the condition in Statement B.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
