We have two statements:\n   - \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it presents two possible scenarios: \n   - The shoes are lined up by the door\n   - The shoes are in the closet\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A, which tells us that the first scenario (\"The shoes are lined up by the door\") is not true.\n\n4. Since Statement B says \"either-or\" and we know the first option (shoes lined up by the door) is false, it logically follows that the second option must be true: the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
