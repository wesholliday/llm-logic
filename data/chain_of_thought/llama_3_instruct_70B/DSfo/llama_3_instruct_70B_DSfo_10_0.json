We are given two statements:\n   - \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that these are the only two possible locations for the missing sock.\n\n3. Since Statement A tells us the missing sock isn't under the bed, we can eliminate this option from Statement B.\n\n4. With the \"under the bed\" option eliminated, we are left with only one possibility: the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
