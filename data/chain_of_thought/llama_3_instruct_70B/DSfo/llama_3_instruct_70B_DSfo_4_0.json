We have two statements:\n   - \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it's napping on the couch\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"the cat isn't playing in the bedroom\"\n\n4. Now, applying the rewritten Statement B to this information, we can conclude: \"If the cat is not playing in the bedroom (which it's not), then it's napping on the couch\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
