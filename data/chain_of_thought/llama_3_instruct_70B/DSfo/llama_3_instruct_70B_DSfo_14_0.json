We are given two statements:\n   - \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B presents an either-or situation, implying that these are the only two possible locations for the milk.\n\n3. From Statement A, we know the milk isn't in the fridge.\n\n4. Since Statement B says the milk must be in one of the two locations (fridge or counter), and it's not in the fridge (from Statement A), the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
