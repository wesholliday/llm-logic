            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink.\"\n\nThis implies that if the condition \"the klank is hooped\" is true, then the consequence \"the wuggy will zink\" must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to infer a new statement: \"If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink.\"\n\nNotice that this new statement adds an additional condition \"the wuggy is out of zloat\" to the original antecedent \"the klank is hooped\". \n\nSince the original statement only guarantees that \"the wuggy will zink\" if \"the klank is hooped\", we can still conclude that \"the wuggy will zink\" even with the additional condition \"the wuggy is out of zloat\". The extra condition doesn't contradict or change the original implication.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
