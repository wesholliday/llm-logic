            "content": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the zonk is twiddled, then it will pluzzle.\"\n\nThis implies that twiddling the zonk is a sufficient condition for it to pluzzle. In other words, if the zonk is twiddled, we can be certain that it will pluzzle.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement: \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle.\"\n\nHere, we have an additional condition - the zonk being blorped. However, the original statement only guarantees that twiddling the zonk will lead to pluzzling, regardless of whether it's blorped or not.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't mention anything about blorping, we can conclude that the additional condition (the zonk being blorped) doesn't affect the outcome. As long as the zonk is twiddled, it will pluzzle, regardless of its blorped state.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will indeed pluzzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
