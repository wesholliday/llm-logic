The original statement only cares about bringinging the splotch, not about the state of the crungle.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to assume that if bringinging the splotch is enough to make the bloop floosh, then adding the condition \"the crungle is splooted\" won't change the outcome. The bloop will still floosh if you bringle the splotch, regardless of the crungle's state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
