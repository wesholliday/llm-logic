However, the consequence remains the same: \"the zarp will splunk\".\n\nSince the original statement only guarantees that \"the zarp will splunk\" if \"the frizzle is dinked\", it does not matter what happens to the sklonk (whether it's grooped or not). The additional condition does not affect the outcome.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will indeed splunk, because the original statement only requires \"the frizzle is dinked\" to be true for the consequence to follow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
