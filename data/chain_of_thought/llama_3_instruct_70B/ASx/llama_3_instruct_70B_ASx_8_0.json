It only cares about whether the plink has morphed or not. \n\nSo, if we assume that the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, we can still conclude that it will tizzle because the original statement guarantees this consequence as long as the plink has morphed, regardless of any additional conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
