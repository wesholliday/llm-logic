The original statement only cares about the klonk being fizzered, and if that's true, then the meeping will nurple regardless of the splat dangling or not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that even with the added condition \"the splat dangles\", the implication still holds: if the klonk is fizzered (and the splat dangles), then the meeping will nurple.\n\nAnswer: yes",
