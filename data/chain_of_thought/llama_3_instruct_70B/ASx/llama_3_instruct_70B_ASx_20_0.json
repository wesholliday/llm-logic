However, the consequence remains the same: \"the whiffle will sploosh\".\n\nSince the original statement only guarantees that \"the whiffle will sploosh\" if \"the plim is grobbled\", it does not matter what additional conditions are added. As long as \"the plim is grobbled\" is true, the consequence \"the whiffle will sploosh\" must still be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the new statement: \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
