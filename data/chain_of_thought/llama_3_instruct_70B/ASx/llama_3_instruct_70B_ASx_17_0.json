It doesn't mention R at all.\n\nHowever, when we add the condition R to P (i.e., P \u2227 R), it doesn't change the fact that P implies Q. The additional information R doesn't contradict or affect the implication from P to Q.\n\nTherefore, if P \u2192 Q is true, then (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q must also be true, because the presence of R doesn't alter the relationship between P and Q.\n\nAnswer: yes",
