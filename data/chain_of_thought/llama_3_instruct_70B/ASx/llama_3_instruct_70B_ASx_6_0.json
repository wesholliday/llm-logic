In other words, we don't know if plorks have any impact on snarfs or glurping.\n\nWithout any additional information, we can't assume that wearing plorks changes the original causal relationship between glurping and hurting snarfs. Therefore, we can't infer that \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs\" solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
