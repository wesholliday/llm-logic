However, it doesn't provide any information about what happens when H (\"the snarp is flooping\") is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to make:\n\n\"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged\" ((F \u2227 H) \u2192 G)\n\nSince the original statement (F \u2192 G) only guarantees that G will be true when F is true, regardless of H, we can conclude that if both F and H are true, G will still be true.\n\nIn other words, the additional condition \"the snarp is flooping\" doesn't change the fact that if the fribble is in the snarp, it will be flugged. Therefore, we can indeed make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
