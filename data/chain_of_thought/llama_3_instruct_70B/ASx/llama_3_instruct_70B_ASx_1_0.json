In other words, if the snark is blimmed, we can conclude that it will definitely floop.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement: \"If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.\"\n\nHere, we have an additional condition - being sproinged - on top of being blimmed. However, the original statement only guarantees that being blimmed is enough to make the snark floop. It doesn't say anything about being sproinged.\n\nSince being blimmed is sufficient for the snark to floop, adding the condition of being sproinged won't change the outcome. If the snark is both blimmed and sproinged, it will still floop because being blimmed is enough to guarantee that.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it indeed flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
