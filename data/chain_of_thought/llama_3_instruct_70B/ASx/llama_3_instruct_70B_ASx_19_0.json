The original statement only cares about the presence of the krimp in the zool, not about any other conditions affecting the zool.\n\nSince the presence of the krimp in the zool is enough to guarantee that the snarf will be glonked, adding the condition \"the zool is zapped\" does not change this conclusion. Therefore, we can infer that if the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will still be glonked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
