It doesn't mention anything about \"troon being zibbled\".\n\nHowever, when we add the condition \"troon is zibbled\", it doesn't contradict or change the original implication. The original statement still holds true: if the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked.\n\nIn other words, the additional condition \"troon is zibbled\" doesn't affect the outcome of the blip being floinked. Therefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
