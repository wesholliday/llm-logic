            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n\nThis implies that whenever the tizzer is on, the goom must be snurpled. It doesn't say anything about what happens when other conditions are met or not met (like the plink light being out).\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n\nWe can see that this statement has an additional condition - the plink light being out. However, our original statement doesn't provide any information about how the plink light affects the relationship between the tizzer and the goom.\n\nBut here's the key: even if we don't know anything about the plink light, we can still be certain that when the tizzer is on, the goom is snurpled (based on our original statement). The additional condition of the plink light being out doesn't change this fact. As long as the tizzer is on, the goom will be snurpled, regardless of the plink light's state.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
