This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The sprocket was not daggled\". This tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. Now, let's think about what this means for the first part of the conditional statement (the sprocket being cranked). If the sprocket being cranked would necessarily lead to it being daggled, but we know it's not daggled, then it must be the case that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
