            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This can be represented as \"C \u2192 S\", where C means \"the sneg was crampled\" and S means \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n2. We are also given that \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\", meaning \"it is not the case that the sneg sproted the frink\".\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf C \u2192 S and \u00acS, then \u00acC.\n\nIn other words, if it's true that \"if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\", and it's also true that \"the sneg did not sproted the frink\", then we can logically conclude that \"the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
