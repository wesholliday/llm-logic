            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 P\", where V means \"the smonk was vreebled\" and P means \"the smonk plagged\".\n2. We are also given that \"The smonk did not plagged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\", meaning \"it is not the case that the smonk plagged\".\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nTo see if we can make this inference, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If V \u2192 P is true, and \u00acP is also true, then it means that the condition \"V\" (the smonk being vreebled) cannot be true, because if it were true, then P (the smonk plagging) would have to be true as well. But we know that P is not true.\n* Therefore, the only way for V \u2192 P and \u00acP to both be true is if V is false.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
