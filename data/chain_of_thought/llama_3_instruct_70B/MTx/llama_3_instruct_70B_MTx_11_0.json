            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This can be represented as \"Blummed \u2192 Zimmed\".\n2. We are also given that \"The flug was not zimmed\", which can be represented as \"\u00acZimmed\" (where \u00ac denotes negation).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\", which would be \"\u00acBlummed\".\n4. To do this, let's analyze the implications of the given statements:\n   - If Blummed \u2192 Zimmed is true, and \u00acZimmed is also true, then it means that the condition \"Blummed\" cannot be true, because if it were, then \"Zimmed\" would have to be true as well (due to the conditional statement). But we know \u00acZimmed, so Blummed must be false.\n5. Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The flug was not blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
