We have a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This can be represented as \"Bluttered \u2192 Surned\".\n2. We are also given that \"The fleeg did not surn\", which means \u00acSurned (not Surned).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these two statements.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf Bluttered \u2192 Surned and \u00acSurned, then \u00acBluttered (not Bluttered).\n\nIn other words, if the fleeg being bluttered implies it surns, but it did not surn, then it must not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
