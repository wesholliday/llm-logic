            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This can be represented as \"Snurgled \u2192 Crinked\".\n2. We are also given that \"The fribble did not crink\", which can be represented as \"\u00acCrinked\" (where \u00ac denotes negation).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acSnurgled\".\n4. To do this, let's analyze the implications of the given statements:\n   - If Snurgled \u2192 Crinked is true, and \u00acCrinked is also true, then it means that the condition \"Snurgled\" cannot be true, because if it were, then \"Crinked\" would have to be true as well (by modus ponens).\n   - Therefore, since \"Crinked\" is not true, we can conclude that \"Snurgled\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
