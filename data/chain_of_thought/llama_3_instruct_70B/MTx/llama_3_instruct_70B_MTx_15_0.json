            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 S\", where V means \"the dreb was vroombed\" and S means \"the dreb was spened\".\n2. We are also given that \"The dreb was not spened\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (not S).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\", which would be \"\u00acV\".\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the implications of the given statements:\n\n* If V \u2192 S is true, and \u00acS is also true, then it means that the condition \"V\" (the dreb being vroombed) cannot be true, because if it were, then S (the dreb being spened) would also be true, which contradicts the fact that \u00acS is true.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that V must be false, i.e., \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
