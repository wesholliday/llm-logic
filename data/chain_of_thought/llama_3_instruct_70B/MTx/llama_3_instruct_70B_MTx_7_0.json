We have a conditional statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This can be represented as \"Shanked \u2192 Tinked\".\n2. We are also given that \"The whiffle did not tink\", which means \u00acTinked (not Tinked).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" from the above statements.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf Shanked \u2192 Tinked and \u00acTinked, then \u00acShanked (not Shanked).\n\nIn other words, if being shanked implies tinkling, and there is no tinkling, then it must be the case that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
