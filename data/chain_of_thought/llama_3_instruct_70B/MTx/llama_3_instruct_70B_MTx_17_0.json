            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This can be represented as \"Skizzled \u2192 Movated\" (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\").\n2. We are also given that \"The flob did not movated,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acMovated\" (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\").\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The flob was not skizzled,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acSkizzled\".\n4. To do this, we can use a rule of inference called modus tollens, which states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\", then we can conclude \"\u00acA\".\n5. In our case, we have \"Skizzled \u2192 Movated\" (A \u2192 B) and \"\u00acMovated\" (\u00acB). Therefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude \"\u00acSkizzled\" (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
