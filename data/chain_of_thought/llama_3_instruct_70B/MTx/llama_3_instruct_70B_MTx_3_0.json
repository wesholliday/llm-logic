This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the splat being morphed) is true, then the second part (the splat quanking) must also be true.\n\n2. Now, we are given the additional information \"The splat did not quank\". This tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. Since the second part is false, and the conditional statement says that if the first part is true then the second part must be true, we can conclude that the first part (the splat being morphed) cannot be true. If it were true, then the second part would also have to be true, but we know it's not.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
