            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be represented as \"Sploffed \u2192 Plopped\" (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\").\n2. We are also given that \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acPlopped\" (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\").\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acSploffed\".\n4. To do this, we can use a logical rule called modus tollens, which states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\", then we can conclude \"\u00acA\".\n5. In our case, we have \"Sploffed \u2192 Plopped\" (A \u2192 B) and \"\u00acPlopped\" (\u00acB). Therefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude \"\u00acSploffed\" (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
