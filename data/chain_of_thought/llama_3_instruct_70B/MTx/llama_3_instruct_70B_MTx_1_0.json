            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This can be represented as \"B \u2192 Z\", where B means \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Z means \"the flugel was zargled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The flugel was not zargled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acZ\" (not Z).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\", which would be \"\u00acB\".\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the implications of the given statements:\n\n* If B \u2192 Z is true, and \u00acZ is also true, then it means that the condition \"B\" (the flugel being blimmed) cannot be true, because if it were, then Z (the flugel being zargled) would also be true, but we know that's not the case.\n* Therefore, since B \u2192 Z and \u00acZ are both true, we can conclude that \u00acB must be true, i.e., \"The flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
