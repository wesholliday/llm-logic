            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This can be represented as \"F \u2192 S\", where F means \"the zinger was fraggled\" and S means \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The zinger was not smoogled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (not S).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\", which would be \"\u00acF\".\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the implications of the given statements:\n\n* If F \u2192 S is true, and \u00acS is also true, then it means that the condition \"F\" (the zinger being fraggled) cannot be true, because if it were, then S (the zinger being smoogled) would have to be true as well. But we know \u00acS is true, so F must be false.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that \u00acF is true, which means \"The zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
