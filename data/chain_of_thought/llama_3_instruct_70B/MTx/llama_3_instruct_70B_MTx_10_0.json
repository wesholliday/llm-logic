            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This can be represented as \"S \u2192 G\", where S means \"the wug was sproinged\" and G means \"it was garpled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The wug was not garpled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acG\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\".\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If S \u2192 G is true, and G did not happen (\u00acG), then it means that the condition for G to happen (S) must not have been met. Otherwise, G would have happened.\n* Therefore, since \u00acG is true, we can conclude that S must be false, i.e., \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\u00acS).\n\nAnswer: yes",
