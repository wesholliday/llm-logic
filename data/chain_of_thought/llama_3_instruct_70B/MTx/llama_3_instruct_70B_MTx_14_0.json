            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This can be represented as \"F \u2192 S\", where F means \"the clug was fleeked\" and S means \"the clug snugged\".\n2. We are also given that \"The clug did not snugged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\", where \u00ac denotes negation (i.e., \"not\").\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acF\".\n4. To do this, we can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if we have F \u2192 S and \u00acS, then we can conclude \u00acF.\n5. In our case, we have F \u2192 S (the conditional statement) and \u00acS (the clug did not snugged), so we can apply modus tollens to conclude \u00acF, i.e., \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
