            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\", where P means \"the shank was plooked\" and N means \"the shank was nugged\".\n2. We also know that \"The shank was not nugged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acN\" (not N).\n3. Now, we want to infer whether \"The shank was not plooked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nTo make this inference, we can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 N and \u00acN, then \u00acP.\n\nIn our case, we have P \u2192 N (the conditional statement) and \u00acN (the shank was not nugged). Therefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude that \u00acP, which means \"The shank was not plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
