Erin took a train (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequence is true but the condition is unknown or false.\n\nGiven only these two statements, we cannot logically infer that Sam took a plane simply because Erin took a train. There might be other reasons why Erin took a train, and we don't have enough information to conclude that Sam's action was the cause.\n\nAnswer: no",
