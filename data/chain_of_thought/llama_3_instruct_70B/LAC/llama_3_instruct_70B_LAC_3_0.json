            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that only James can write mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book is indeed a mystery novel, but it doesn't provide any information about who the author is.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can logically infer that \"The book was written by James\" from these two statements. Unfortunately, we cannot make this inference because statement 1 only guarantees that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel, but it does not guarantee that James is the only one who could have written a mystery novel.\n\nIn other words, just because the book is a mystery novel (statement 2), we cannot conclude that James must be the author. There might be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
