Jen watched basketball (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. But this doesn't necessarily mean that Tom watched football.\n\nThe fact that Jen watched basketball (statement 2) only confirms the consequent of the conditional statement, but it doesn't provide any information about the antecedent (Tom watching football).\n\nIn other words, just because Jen watched basketball, we can't conclude that Tom must have watched football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
