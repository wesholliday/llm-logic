The truck was blue (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck is blue, then the car must be red.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the truth of the consequent (the truck being blue) if the antecedent (the car being red) is true. It does not provide any information about the antecedent being true if the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"The car was red\".\n\nAnswer: no",
