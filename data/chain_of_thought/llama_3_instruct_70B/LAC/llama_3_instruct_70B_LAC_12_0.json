Lucy went to the zoo (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequence is true but the condition is unknown or false.\n\nGiven only these two statements, we cannot logically infer that Joe went to the park simply because Lucy went to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
