Chris finished the race (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris finished, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Chris finished but Alex did not.\n\nGiven statement 2, we know that Chris finished the race. However, this alone is not enough to conclude that Alex finished the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race that have nothing to do with Alex finishing the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
