The muffins were blueberry (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. But it doesn't necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, the cake must be chocolate.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees one direction: chocolate cake \u2192 blueberry muffins. It does not guarantee the reverse direction: blueberry muffins \u2192 chocolate cake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The cake was chocolate\" simply because the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
