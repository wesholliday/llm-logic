The robot visited Jupiter (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" is true, then the consequent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is indeed true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that \"the alien visited Mars\" is true. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter, unrelated to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We cannot logically infer that the antecedent (\"the alien visited Mars\") is true simply because the consequent (\"the robot visited Jupiter\") is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
