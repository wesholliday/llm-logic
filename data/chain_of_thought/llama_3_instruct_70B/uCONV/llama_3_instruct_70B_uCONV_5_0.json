Specifically, it means that whenever Jeff plays basketball, Amy must play tennis.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that \"if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\".\n\nHowever, the original statement only guarantees that Amy plays tennis when Jeff plays basketball. It does not provide any information about what happens when Amy plays tennis in general. There might be other scenarios where Amy plays tennis without Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
