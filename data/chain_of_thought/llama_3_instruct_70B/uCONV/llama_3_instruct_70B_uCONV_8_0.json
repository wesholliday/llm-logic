If the vampire is awake, we can conclude that the mummy is also awake. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens if the mummy is awake.\n\nIn other words, just because the vampire being awake guarantees the mummy's wakefulness, it doesn't necessarily mean that the mummy being awake guarantees the vampire's wakefulness. There might be scenarios where the mummy is awake, but the vampire is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
