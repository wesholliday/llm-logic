Specifically, it means that whenever Tom watches football, we can be certain that Jen watches basketball.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer the converse: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n\nHowever, the original statement only guarantees that if Tom watches football, Jen will watch basketball. It does not provide any information about what happens when Jen watches basketball. Perhaps Jen watches basketball regardless of whether Tom watches football or not.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Jen watching basketball implies Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
