This would mean: Chris \u2192 Alex\n\nHowever, just because Alex finishing implies Chris finishing, it doesn't necessarily mean that Chris finishing implies Alex finishing. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, unrelated to Alex.\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where Alex and Chris are both excellent runners, but they ran in different lanes. If Alex finished the race, it's likely that Chris also finished, simply because Chris is a good runner. But if Chris finished the race, we can't conclude that Alex must have finished, because maybe Alex tripped or got injured during the race.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning...\n\nAnswer: no",
