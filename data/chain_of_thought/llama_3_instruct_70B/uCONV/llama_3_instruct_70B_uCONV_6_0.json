Specifically, it means that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob will choose pasta.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\".\n\nHowever, the original statement only tells us what happens when Sue chooses pizza (i.e., Bob chooses pasta). It doesn't provide any information about what happens when Bob chooses pasta. There could be other scenarios where Bob chooses pasta, but Sue didn't choose pizza.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that Sue choosing pizza implies Bob choosing pasta, it doesn't necessarily mean that Bob choosing pasta implies Sue choosing pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
