However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Mary did not attend.\n\nNow, the question asks whether we can infer that \"if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This would be represented as:\n\nSue \u2192 Mary\n\nBut we cannot make this inference based on the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that if Mary attended, Sue also attended. It does not provide any information about what happens if Sue attended but Mary did not.\n\nIn other words, just because Sue attended the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary attended. There could be scenarios where Sue attended without Mary.\n\nAnswer: no",
