The original statement only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, the pants will be denim. It does not provide any information about what happens when the pants are denim.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that cotton shirts imply denim pants, it doesn't necessarily mean that denim pants imply cotton shirts. There could be other possibilities for the shirt material when the pants are denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
