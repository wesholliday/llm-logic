This would be represented as:\n\nCat outside \u2192 Dog inside\n\nTo determine if this is true, let's analyze the original statement. If the dog is inside, it implies that the cat must be outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\nThere could be other scenarios where the cat is outside and the dog is also outside, or even where the cat is outside and we don't know anything about the dog's location.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we cannot infer with certainty that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
