The original statement only guarantees that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. It does not guarantee the converse, i.e., that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n\nThere could be other scenarios where the muffins are blueberry, but the cake is not chocolate. For example, maybe the muffins are always blueberry, regardless of the type of cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
