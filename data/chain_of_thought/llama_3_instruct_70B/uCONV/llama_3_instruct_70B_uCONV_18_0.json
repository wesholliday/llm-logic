However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck is metal, the doll must be plastic.\n\nTo infer the converse, \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic,\" we would need to show that:\n\nM (truck is metal) \u2192 P (doll is plastic)\n\nBut we don't have enough information to make this conclusion. The original statement only guarantees that if the doll is plastic, the truck is metal, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the truck is metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
