However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane or when Erin takes a train.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n\nTo determine this, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If Erin took a train, it could be because Sam took a plane (as stated in the original statement).\n2. But it's also possible that Erin took a train for some other reason unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nSince we can't rule out the second possibility, we cannot infer with certainty that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
