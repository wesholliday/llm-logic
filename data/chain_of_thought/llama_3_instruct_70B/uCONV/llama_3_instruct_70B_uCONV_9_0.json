            "content": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nWe are given a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as:\n\nLisa buys red shirt \u2192 Mark buys blue shirt\n\nThis implies that if the condition on the left (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence on the right (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true. This would be represented as:\n\nMark buys blue shirt \u2192 Lisa buys red shirt\n\nHowever, just because we know that Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark buying the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Mark buying the blue shirt implies Lisa buying the red shirt. There could be other scenarios where Mark buys the blue shirt without Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nIn logic, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. We cannot assume that just because the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true, the original condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
