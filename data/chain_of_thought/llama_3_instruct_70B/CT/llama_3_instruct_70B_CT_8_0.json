            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThis implies that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. In other words, the vampire's wakefulness guarantees the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse scenario: what if the mummy is not awake? Can we infer anything about the vampire's state?\n\nIf the mummy is not awake, it means that the condition \"the mummy was awake\" is false. Since the original statement implies that the vampire's wakefulness guarantees the mummy's wakefulness, it follows that if the mummy is not awake, the vampire cannot be awake either.\n\nIn other words, if the mummy is not awake, it would contradict the original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" because the vampire's wakefulness would imply the mummy's wakefulness, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
