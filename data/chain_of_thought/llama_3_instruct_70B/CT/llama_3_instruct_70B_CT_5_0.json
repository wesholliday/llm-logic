In other words, Jeff playing basketball is a sufficient condition for Amy to have played tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse implication: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\"\n\nTo see if this follows logically, we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of an implication \"if A, then B\" is \"if not B, then not A\". In our case, the original implication is \"if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\", so its contrapositive would be \"if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nNotice that this contrapositive statement is exactly what we are trying to infer. Since the contrapositive of an implication is always logically equivalent to the original implication, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
