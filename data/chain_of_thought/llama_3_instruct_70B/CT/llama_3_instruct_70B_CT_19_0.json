Modus tollens states that if we have an implication \"if P, then Q\", and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nIn our case, the original statement implies \"if Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q)\". If we now assume that \"Jen did not watch basketball\" (~Q), then using modus tollens, we can conclude that \"Tom did not watch football\" (~P).\n\nTherefore, the proposed inference is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
