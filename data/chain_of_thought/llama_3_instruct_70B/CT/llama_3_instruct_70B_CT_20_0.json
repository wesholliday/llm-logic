This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\". It states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (i.e., not Q), then we can conclude that P must also be false (i.e., not P).\n\nIn our case, if we assume that the banana was not yellow (not Q), then according to modus tollens, we can infer that the apple was not red (not P).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
