            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n\nThis implies that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal. In other words, a plastic doll guarantees a metal truck.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse implication: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\"\n\nIf the truck is not metal, it means the condition for the doll to be plastic (i.e., the truck being metal) is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that if the truck is not metal, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nThis converse implication is indeed true and logically follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
