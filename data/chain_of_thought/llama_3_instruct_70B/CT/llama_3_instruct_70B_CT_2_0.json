            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\nThis implies that if the griffin is present in the forest, the unicorn must also be present. In other words, the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\"\n\nThis statement says that if the unicorn is absent from the forest, then the griffin must also be absent. In other words, the absence of the unicorn guarantees the absence of the griffin.\n\nNotice that this inferred statement is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement implies that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn, it also implies that the absence of the unicorn guarantees the absence of the griffin. Therefore, we can indeed infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
