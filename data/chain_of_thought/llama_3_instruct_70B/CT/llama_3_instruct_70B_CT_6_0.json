In other words, if Sue chose pizza, it guarantees that Bob chose pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse scenario: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\"\n\nIf Bob did not choose pasta, it means that the condition \"Bob chose pasta\" is not true. Since we know that \"Sue chose pizza\" implies \"Bob chose pasta\", if \"Bob chose pasta\" is not true, then \"Sue chose pizza\" cannot be true either.\n\nIn other words, if Bob didn't choose pasta, it would contradict the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". Therefore, we can conclude that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue must not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
