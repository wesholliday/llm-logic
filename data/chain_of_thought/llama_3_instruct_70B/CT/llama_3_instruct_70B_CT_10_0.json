In other words, the presence of the dog inside guarantees the absence of the cat outside.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nWe can analyze this by assuming the opposite of the conclusion, i.e., the dog was inside. But if the dog is inside, then according to the original statement, the cat must be outside. This contradicts our assumption that the cat was not outside.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the cat was not outside, it must be because the dog was not inside. This inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
