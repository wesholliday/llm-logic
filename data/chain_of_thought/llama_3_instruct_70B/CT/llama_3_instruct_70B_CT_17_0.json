            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\"\n\nThis implies that if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad. In other words, Ben eating pasta is a sufficient condition for Kate to eat the salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\"\n\nThis statement says that if Kate didn't eat the salad, then Ben must not have eaten pasta. In other words, Kate not eating the salad is a sufficient condition for Ben not to have eaten pasta.\n\nNotice that these two statements are actually contrapositives of each other. The original statement says \"If A (Ben ate pasta), then B (Kate ate the salad)\", and the inferred statement says \"If not B (Kate didn't eat the salad), then not A (Ben didn't eat pasta)\".\n\nIn logic, it is a valid inference to conclude that if A implies B, then not B implies not A. This is known as the contrapositive rule.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
