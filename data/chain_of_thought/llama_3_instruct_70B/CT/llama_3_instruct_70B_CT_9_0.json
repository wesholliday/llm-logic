            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. In other words, if the condition \"Lisa buys the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark buys the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, let's analyze the given statement again. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (by the given condition). This means that if Mark did NOT buy the blue shirt, it would imply that the condition \"Lisa buys the red shirt\" was not met.\n\nIn other words, if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, it would mean that Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt, because if she had, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt (by the given condition).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
