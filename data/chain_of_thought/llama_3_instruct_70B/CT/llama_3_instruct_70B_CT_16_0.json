            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n\nThis implies that if the shirt is cotton, it necessarily means the pants are denim. In other words, cotton shirt \u2192 denim pants.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse implication: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\"\n\nTo see if this follows logically, we can try to construct a counterexample. Suppose the pants were not denim. Can we still have a cotton shirt? If so, it would mean the original statement is false, because it claims that a cotton shirt implies denim pants.\n\nHowever, there's no inherent contradiction in having non-denim pants with a cotton shirt. The original statement only guarantees denim pants if the shirt is cotton, but it doesn't restrict what happens when the pants are not denim.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" is indeed a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
