In other words, Alex finishing is a sufficient condition for Chris to finish.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\"\n\nThis statement says that if Chris didn't finish, then Alex couldn't have finished either. In other words, Chris not finishing is a sufficient condition for Alex not to have finished.\n\nNotice that these two statements are actually contrapositives of each other. The original statement says \"If A, then C\", and the inferred statement says \"If not C, then not A\". This is a valid logical inference, known as modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
