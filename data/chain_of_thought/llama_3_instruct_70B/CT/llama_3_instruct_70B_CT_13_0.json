In other words, a red car guarantees a blue truck.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\"\n\nIf the truck is not blue, it means that the condition for the car to be red (i.e., the truck being blue) is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that if the truck is not blue, the car cannot be red.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the converse statement \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" is indeed true, given the original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
