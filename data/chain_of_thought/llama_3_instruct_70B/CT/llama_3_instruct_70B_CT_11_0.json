            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThis implies that if the cake is chocolate, it necessarily means the muffins are blueberry. In other words, having a chocolate cake guarantees blueberry muffins.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse implication: \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, we can ask ourselves: If the muffins are not blueberry, does it necessarily mean the cake is not chocolate?\n\nWell, if the original statement is true, and the muffins are not blueberry, it means that the condition \"the cake was chocolate\" did not hold. Because if the cake were indeed chocolate, the muffins would have been blueberry (according to the original statement). Since they're not blueberry, we can conclude that the cake must not be chocolate.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer: \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
