            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThis implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. In other words, being written by James is a sufficient condition for the book to be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nThis statement is saying that if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James. In other words, not being a mystery novel is a sufficient condition for the book not to have been written by James.\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, let's think about what would happen if the original statement is true, but the inferred statement is false. If the book is not a mystery novel, but it was still written by James, that would mean the original statement is false (because being written by James doesn't guarantee it's a mystery novel). But we assumed the original statement is true, so this scenario can't happen.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, the inferred statement must also be true. We can indeed infer: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
