            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThis implies a causal relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. In other words, if Joe goes to the park, it guarantees that Lucy will go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nTo evaluate this, we can use a technique called \"modus tollens.\" It states that if we have an implication \"if A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn our case, the original statement implies \"if Joe went to the park (A), then Lucy went to the zoo (B)\". If we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (not B), then using modus tollens, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park (not A).\n\nTherefore, our reasoning suggests that the proposed inference is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
