In other words, Mary's attendance guarantees Sue's attendance.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\"\n\nThis statement says that if Sue did not attend the wedding, then Mary must not have attended either.\n\nThink about it... If Sue didn't attend, and we know that Mary's attendance guarantees Sue's attendance, then it means Mary couldn't have attended either. Because if Mary had attended, Sue would have also attended (according to the original statement), but we know Sue didn't attend.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
