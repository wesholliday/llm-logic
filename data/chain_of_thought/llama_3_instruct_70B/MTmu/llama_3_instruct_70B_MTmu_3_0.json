            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If J, then M\" where J stands for \"the book was written by James\" and M stands for \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\". This can be represented as \"Not M\".\n3. We want to infer whether \"The book was not written by James\", which can be represented as \"Not J\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf J implies M (from statement 1), and we know Not M (from statement 2), then it means that the condition for M to be true is not satisfied. In other words, since M is false, the only way this can happen is if J is also false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
