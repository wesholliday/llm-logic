We can rewrite this as: \"Mary was at the wedding \u2192 Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This means: \u00ac(Sue must have been at the wedding)\n5. Using modus tollens, we can infer: \u00ac(Mary was at the wedding)\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
