            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\n\"If P, then Q\"\n\nwhere P = \"the doll was plastic\" and Q = \"the truck must have been metal\".\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\". This can be represented as:\n\n\"Not Q\"\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\", which is equivalent to \"Not P\".\n\n4. From the first statement, we know that if P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck must have been metal) would follow. But since Not Q is true (it's not the case that the truck must have been metal), it means that P cannot be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The doll was not plastic\", which is equivalent to Not P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
