            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\np \u2192 q\n\nwhere p = \"the cake was chocolate\" and q = \"the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\". This can be represented as:\n\n\u00acq\n\nwhich means \"not q\", or in this case, \"it's not true that the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from these two statements. This would be represented as:\n\n\u00acp\n\n4. To see if we can make this inference, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf p \u2192 q is true, and \u00acq is also true, then it means that the condition \"p\" (the cake being chocolate) cannot be true, because if it were, then q (muffins being blueberry) would have to be true as well. But we know that q is not true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that p must be false, which means:\n\n\u00acp\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
