We can rewrite this as: \"The dog was inside \u2192 The cat must have been outside\" (using arrow notation for implication)\n3. Now, we are also given: \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This means: \u00ac(The cat must have been outside) (using negation symbol)\n5. Since the original conditional statement implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, we can use modus tollens:\n6. If the consequent is false (\u00ac(The cat must have been outside)), and the implication holds, then the antecedent must also be false.\n7. Therefore, we can conclude: \u00ac(The dog was inside) or \"The dog was not inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
