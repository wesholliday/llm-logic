We are also given: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad\" (negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad. But the second statement tells us that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude:\n\n* If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad (given)\n* Kate did not eat the salad (given)\n* Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta (inference)\n\nAnswer: yes",
