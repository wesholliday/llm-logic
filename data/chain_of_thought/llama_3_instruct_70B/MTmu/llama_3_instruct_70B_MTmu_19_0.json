We are also given: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" (negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. But the second statement tells us that it's not true that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\n* If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (given)\n* It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (given)\n* Therefore, Tom did not watch football (inferred)\n\nAnswer: yes",
