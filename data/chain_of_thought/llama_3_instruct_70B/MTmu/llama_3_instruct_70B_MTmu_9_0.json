            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" (conditional statement)\n2. We are also given: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" (negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Lisa buys the red shirt, it necessarily implies that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" cannot be true, because if it were, it would imply that Mark bought the blue shirt, which we know is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
