            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can represent this as: Griffin \u2192 Unicorn (where \u2192 means \"implies\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acUnicorn (where \u00ac means \"not\")\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\", which can be represented as: \u00acGriffin\n6. To do this, we can use modus tollens, a logical rule that states: If A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA.\n7. In our case, A = Griffin and B = Unicorn. We have Griffin \u2192 Unicorn (step 1) and \u00acUnicorn (step 4).\n8. Applying modus tollens, we can conclude: \u00acGriffin\n\nAnswer: yes",
