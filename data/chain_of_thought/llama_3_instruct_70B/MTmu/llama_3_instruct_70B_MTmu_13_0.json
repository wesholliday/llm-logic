            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P = \"the car was red\" and Q = \"the truck must have been blue\".\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\". This is equivalent to saying \"Not Q\", where Q is still \"the truck must have been blue\".\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The car was not red\" from these two statements.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue)\n\u00acQ (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue)\n\u2234 \u00acP (The car was not red)\n\nIn other words, if the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
