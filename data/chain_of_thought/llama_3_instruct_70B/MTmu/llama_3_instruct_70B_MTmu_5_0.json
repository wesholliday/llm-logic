We are also given: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" (negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This implies a causal relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\". This means that Amy did not necessarily play tennis.\n\nUsing modus tollens (a logical rule of inference), we can conclude:\n\n* If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis (given)\n* But Amy did not necessarily play tennis (given)\n* Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (inference)\n\nAnswer: yes",
