We are also given: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\" (negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first statement:\n\n* If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\n* But we know Bob didn't necessarily choose pasta (from step 2)\n* Therefore, the only way to reconcile this is if Sue did not choose pizza\n\nIf Sue had chosen pizza, it would imply that Bob must have chosen pasta, but we know that's not the case. So, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
