            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nC (cotton shirt) \u2192 D (denim pants)\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This means the negation of D:\n\n\u00acD\n\n3. Now, we want to infer whether the shirt was not cotton (\u2200C). To do this, we can use modus tollens, a logical rule that states:\n\nIf C \u2192 D and \u00acD, then \u00acC\n\nIn our case, if C (cotton shirt) implies D (denim pants), and it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (\u00acD), then we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton (\u2200C).\n\nAnswer: yes",
