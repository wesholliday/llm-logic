            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can rewrite this as: \"If Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n3. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. We can rewrite this as: \"\u00ac(Lucy must have gone to the zoo)\"\n5. Now, we want to infer whether Joe went to the park or not.\n6. Since the second premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement, we can apply modus tollens (a rule of inference).\n7. Modus tollens states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\", then we can conclude \"\u00acA\".\n8. In our case, \"A\" is \"Joe went to the park\" and \"B\" is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n9. Applying modus tollens, we get: \"If \u00ac(Lucy must have gone to the zoo), then \u00ac(Joe went to the park)\"\n10. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
