            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as \"R \u2192 Y\", where R is \"the apple was red\" and Y is \"the banana must have been yellow\".\n2. We are also given the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\". This can be represented as \"\u00acY\", which means \"not Y\".\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from these two statements. This would be represented as \"\u00acR\".\n\nTo see if we can make this inference, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If R \u2192 Y is true, and \u00acY is also true, then it means that the condition \"R\" (the apple being red) cannot be true, because if it were, then Y (the banana being yellow) would have to be true as well. But we know \u00acY is true, so R cannot be true.\n* Therefore, from R \u2192 Y and \u00acY, we can indeed infer \u00acR, which means \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
