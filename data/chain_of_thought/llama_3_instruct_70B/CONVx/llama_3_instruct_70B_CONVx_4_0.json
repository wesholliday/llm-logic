There could be other reasons why the fribble crinked.\n\nFor example, maybe the fribble can crink due to other factors, like being flumplenooked or glazzled. In those cases, the fribble would still crink, but it wouldn't have been snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the fribble crinked, then it was necessarily snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
