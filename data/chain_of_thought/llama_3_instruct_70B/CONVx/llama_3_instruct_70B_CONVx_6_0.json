This is a classic logical fallacy.\n\nFor example, \"If it's raining, then the streets are wet\" (Raining \u2192 WetStreets) does not imply \"If the streets are wet, then it's raining\" (WetStreets \u2192 Raining), because there could be other reasons why the streets are wet.\n\nSo, in our case, we cannot infer that if the grommet plopped the frink, then it was sploffed. There might be other reasons why the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: no",
