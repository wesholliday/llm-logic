This would be a conditional statement in the form of \"If B, then A\", which is not necessarily true just because \"If A, then B\" is true.\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called \"converse implication\", and it is not a valid logical inference. Just because A implies B, it does not mean that B implies A.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the streets are wet.\" This does not imply that \"If the streets are wet, then it's raining\", because there could be other reasons why the streets are wet (e.g., a water main break).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
