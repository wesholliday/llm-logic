This would be a conditional statement in the form of \"If B, then A\".\n\nHowever, just because A implies B, it does not necessarily mean that B implies A. In other words, the fact that being morphed leads to quanking does not guarantee that quanking means it was morphed.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the splat can quank for reasons unrelated to being morphed. In this case, just because the splat quanked, we cannot conclude that it was morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\".\n\nAnswer: no",
