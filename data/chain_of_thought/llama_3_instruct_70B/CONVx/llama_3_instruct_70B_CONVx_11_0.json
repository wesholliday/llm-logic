Notice that this is the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because we know that \"If P, then Q\" does not mean that \"If Q, then P\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed\".\n\nAnswer: no",
