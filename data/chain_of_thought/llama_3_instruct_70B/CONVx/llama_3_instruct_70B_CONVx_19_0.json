However, it does not imply that plagging is a sufficient condition for being vreebled.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that being vreebled leads to plagging, it doesn't necessarily mean that plagging always implies being vreebled. There could be other reasons why the smonk plagged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer statement B from statement A.\n\nAnswer: no",
