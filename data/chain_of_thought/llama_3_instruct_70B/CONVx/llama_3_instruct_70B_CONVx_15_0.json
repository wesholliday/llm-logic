In other words, if the dreb is vroombed, we can conclude that it must also be spened.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\"\n\nThis would imply that being spened is a sufficient condition for the dreb to be vroombed. However, the original statement only guarantees that vroombing leads to spending, but it does not guarantee that spending necessarily means vroombing.\n\nIn other words, just because the dreb is spened, we cannot conclude that it must have been vroombed. There might be other ways for the dreb to become spened without being vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
