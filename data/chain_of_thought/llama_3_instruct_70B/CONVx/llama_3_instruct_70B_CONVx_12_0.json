Notice that this is the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because A implies B, it doesn't mean that B implies A.\n\nFor example, consider: \"If it's raining, then the streets are wet\". This is true, but its converse \"If the streets are wet, then it's raining\" is not necessarily true (the streets could be wet for other reasons).\n\nSo, in this case, we cannot infer \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped\" solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
