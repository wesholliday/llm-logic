This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The clug is not snugged\". This tells us that the first option (\"the clug is snugged\") is false.\n\n3. Since the first option is false and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), the only remaining possibility is that the second option (\"it is fleeked\") is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
