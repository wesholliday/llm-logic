This implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The splat is not quanked\". This means that the first option (the splat being quanked) is false.\n\n3. Since one of the two options must be true, and the first option is false, it follows that the second option (the splat being morphed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
