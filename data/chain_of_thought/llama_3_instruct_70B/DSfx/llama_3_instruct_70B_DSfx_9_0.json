We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The twonk is not plinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked\" (using the rule of inference that \"A or B\" is equivalent to \"not A implies B\").\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that the twonk is not plinked.\n\n4. Using modus tollens (a rule of inference), if we know \"If the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked\" and we also know that the twonk is not plinked, then we can conclude that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
