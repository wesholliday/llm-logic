This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The dreb is not spened\", which means we can eliminate the possibility that the dreb is spened.\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. Since the dreb is not spened (from step 2), and it's an \"or\" statement, the only remaining option is that the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
