This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The glip is not tragged\". This tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement (the glip being tragged) is false.\n\n3. Since the first option is false and we know that one of the two options must be true, the only possibility left is that the second option (the glip being slogged) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
