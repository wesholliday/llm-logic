The first statement can be rewritten as \"If the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned\". This is because \"either A or B\" implies \"if not B, then A\".\n3. Now, we are told that \"The fleeg is not surned\". This means that the condition \"the fleeg is not bluttered\" in step 2 does not hold.\n4. Therefore, by modus tollens (a logical rule of inference), we can conclude that the consequence \"it must be surned\" in step 2 also does not hold.\n5. Since the only other option is that \"the fleeg is bluttered\", we can infer that this must be the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
