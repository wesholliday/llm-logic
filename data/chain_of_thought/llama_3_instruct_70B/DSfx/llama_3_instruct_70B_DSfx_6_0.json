This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The grommet is not plopped\". This tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement (the grommet being plopped) is definitely false.\n\n3. Since the first option is false and we know that one or both of the options must be true (from step 1), the only possibility left is that the second option (the grommet being sploffed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
