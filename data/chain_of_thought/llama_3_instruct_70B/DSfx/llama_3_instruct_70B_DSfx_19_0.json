We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The smonk is not plagged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement B, which tells us that the smonk is not plagged. \n\n4. Since the smonk is not plagged (from Statement B), and we know from Statement A that there are only two possibilities (either plagged or vreebled), it must be the case that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
