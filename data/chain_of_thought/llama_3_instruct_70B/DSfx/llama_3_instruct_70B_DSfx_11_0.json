The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the flug: it is either zimmed or blummed.\n3. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that the flug is zimmed.\n4. Since the flug cannot be zimmed (by the second statement), and it must be either zimmed or blummed (by the first statement), we are left with only one possibility: the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
