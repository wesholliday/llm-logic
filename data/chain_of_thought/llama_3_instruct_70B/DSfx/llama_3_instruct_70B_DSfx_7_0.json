We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The whiffle is not tinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked\" (using the rule of inference that \"P or Q\" is equivalent to \"not P implies Q\").\n\n3. Now, we are given that the whiffle is not tinked (Statement B).\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference that states \"from 'if P then Q' and 'P', infer 'Q'\"), we can combine Statement A (rewritten) with Statement B to conclude: \n   - If the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked (Statement A rewritten)\n   - The whiffle is not tinked (Statement B)\n   Therefore, the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
