This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The sprocket is not daggled\", which means we can eliminate the possibility of the sprocket being daggled.\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. Since the sprocket is not daggled (from step 2), and it must be either daggled or cranked (from step 1), the only remaining option is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
