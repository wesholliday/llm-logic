We are given two premises:\n   - \"Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged\" (This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true.)\n   - \"The wug is not garpled\" (This tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement is false.)\n\n2. Since the first option (\"the wug is garpled\") is false, and we know that at least one of the options in the \"or\" statement must be true, then the second option (\"it is sproinged\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
