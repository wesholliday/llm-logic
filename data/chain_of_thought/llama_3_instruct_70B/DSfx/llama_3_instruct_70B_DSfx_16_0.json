We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The sneg is not sproted\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted\" (using the rule of inference that \"A or B\" is equivalent to \"not A implies B\").\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n4. Using modus tollens (a rule of inference), we can conclude from steps 2 and 3 that the sneg must be crampled. This is because if it's not sproted, then according to Statement A, it must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
