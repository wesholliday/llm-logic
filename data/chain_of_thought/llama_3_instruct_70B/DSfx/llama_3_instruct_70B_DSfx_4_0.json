We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The fribble is not crinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled\" (using the rule of inference that \"A or B\" is equivalent to \"not A implies B\").\n\n3. Now, we have Statement B, which tells us that \"The fribble is not crinked\".\n\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the fribble is not crinked (which it's not), then it must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
