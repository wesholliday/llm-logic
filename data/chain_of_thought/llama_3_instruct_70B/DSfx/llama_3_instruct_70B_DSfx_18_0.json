This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The shank is not nugged\", which means we can rule out the possibility that the shank is nugged.\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. Since the shank is not nugged (from step 2), and it's an \"or\" statement, the only remaining option is that the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
