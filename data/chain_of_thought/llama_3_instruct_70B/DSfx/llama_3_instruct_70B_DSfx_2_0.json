The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the wug: it is either bimmed or flooped.\n3. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that the wug is bimmed.\n4. Since we know the wug is not bimmed, and there are only two possibilities (bimmed or flooped), we can conclude that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
