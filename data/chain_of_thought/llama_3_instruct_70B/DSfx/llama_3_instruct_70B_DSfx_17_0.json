The first statement can be rewritten as \"If the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated\". This is because \"either A or B\" means \"if not A, then B\".\n3. Now, we are told that \"The flob is not movated\". This means that the condition \"the flob is not skizzled\" in step 2 cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"then it must be movated\" in step 2 does not apply.\n5. However, this also means that the only other possibility left is that \"the flob is skizzled\", since we know it's not movated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
