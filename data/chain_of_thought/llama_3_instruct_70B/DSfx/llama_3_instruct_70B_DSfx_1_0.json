We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The flugel is not zargled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled\" (using the rule of inference that \"P or Q\" is equivalent to \"not P implies Q\").\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that the flugel is not zargled.\n\n4. Using modus tollens (a rule of inference), if we know \"If the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled\" and \"The flugel is not zargled\", we can conclude that \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
