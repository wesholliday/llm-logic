We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The smip is not lupped\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the smip is not lupped, then it is shripped\" (using the rule of inference that \"P or Q\" is equivalent to \"not P implies Q\").\n\n3. Now, we are given that \"The smip is not lupped\" (Statement B).\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference that states \"from P and 'if P then Q', infer Q\"), we can combine Statement B with the rewritten Statement A to conclude: \n   - If the smip is not lupped, then it is shripped (rewritten Statement A)\n   - The smip is not lupped (Statement B)\n   Therefore, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
