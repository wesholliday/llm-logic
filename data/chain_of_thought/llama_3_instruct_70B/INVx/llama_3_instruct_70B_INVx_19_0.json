The contrapositive of p \u2192 q is indeed \u223cq \u2192 \u223cp.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer \u223cp \u2192 \u223cq from p \u2192 q. To do so would be committing a logical fallacy.\n\nBut, we can use a little trick: we can infer the contrapositive (\u223cq \u2192 \u223cp) from p \u2192 q, and then use that to infer \u223cp \u2192 \u223cq.\n\nSo, from p \u2192 q, we can infer \u223cq \u2192 \u223cp (the contrapositive).\n\nNow, if we had \u223cq \u2192 \u223cp, we could use the law of contraposition again to infer \u223cp \u2192 \u223cq. But we do have \u223cq \u2192 \u223cp, so...\n\nAnswer: yes",
