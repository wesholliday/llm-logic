Can we conclude that it didn't tink?\n\nThe key insight here is that the original statement only guarantees a connection between being shanked and tinkling. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the whiffle is not shanked.\n\nIn other words, just because being shanked implies tinkling, it doesn't mean that not being shanked implies not tinkling. There might be other reasons why the whiffle tinked or didn't tink, unrelated to being shanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" solely based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
