This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called the \"contrapositive\" of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is indeed \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\nSo, in this case, we can infer that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
