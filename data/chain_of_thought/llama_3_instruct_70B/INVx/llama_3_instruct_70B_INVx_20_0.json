This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is indeed \"If not P, then not Q\", and it is a valid inference.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we can infer that if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\n\nAnswer: yes",
