            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\nWe want to know if we can infer: \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\", where not P is \"the sneg was not crampled\" and not Q is \"the sneg did not sprot the frink\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called the \"contrapositive\". The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always true.\n\nHowever, we are asked if we can infer \"If not P, then not Q\", which is not necessarily true. This type of inference is called the \"inverse\", and it is not always valid.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" solely from the given statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\". There might be other cases where the sneg did not sprot the frink even if it was crampled, or where it did sprot the frink even if it was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
