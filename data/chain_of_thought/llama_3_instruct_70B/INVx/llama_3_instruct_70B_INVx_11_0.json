This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called the \"contrapositive\" of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is indeed \"If not Q, then not P\", but it's not exactly what we're looking for here.\n\nHowever, we can use a simple logical equivalence to help us out. The statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". This means that if the flug was not zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\". Well, if the flug was not blummed, then (by the equivalence mentioned above) it was not zimmed. So, yes, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
