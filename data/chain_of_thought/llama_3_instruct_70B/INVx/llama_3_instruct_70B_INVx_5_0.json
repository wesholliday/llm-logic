However, it's important to note that modus tollens only works when we have two premises: \"If P, then Q\" and \"not P\", which allows us to conclude \"not Q\".\n\nIn our case, we only have one premise: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\". We don't have any information about what happens when the zinger is not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" solely based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
