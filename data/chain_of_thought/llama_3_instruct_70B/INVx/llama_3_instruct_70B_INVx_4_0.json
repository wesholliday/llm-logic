The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is indeed \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nHowever, we are asked to infer \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not exactly the same as the contrapositive. But, we can use a simple logical equivalence to show that \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to Q \u2192 P, which is the converse of the original statement.\n\nUnfortunately, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because P \u2192 Q is true, it does not mean that Q \u2192 P is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" solely based on the original statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\".\n\nAnswer: no",
