We can't conclude anything about being zargled or not from the original statement.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only provides information about the case where the flugel is blimmed, but it doesn't provide any information about the case where the flugel is not blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nAnswer: no",
