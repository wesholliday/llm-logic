The original statement only tells us what happens when the twonk is plinked, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the twonk is not plinked.\n\nIn other words, just because being plinked implies being varnished, it does not necessarily mean that not being plinked implies not being varnished. There could be other reasons why a twonk might or might not be varnished, regardless of whether it was plinked or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
