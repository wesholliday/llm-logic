This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when P is true, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when P is false.\n\nFor example, consider a different scenario: \"If it rains, then the street will be wet\". From this, we cannot infer \"If it doesn't rain, then the street won't be wet\", because there could be other reasons why the street is wet (e.g., a flood, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nSo, in our original case, from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\", we cannot infer \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\".\n\nAnswer: no",
