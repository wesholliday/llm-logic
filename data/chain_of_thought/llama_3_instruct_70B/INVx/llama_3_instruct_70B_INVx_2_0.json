It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P must also be false.\n\nHowever, in our case, we don't have any information about the truth value of Q (the wug bimmed the zoint). We only have the original conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive inference about what happens when the wug is not flooped.\n\nAnswer: no",
