            "content": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated\".\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\". This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is indeed \"If not Q, then not P\", but it's not exactly what we're looking for here.\n\nHowever, we can use a indirect approach to see if the desired inference holds. Let's assume that \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob movated\" (the opposite of what we want to infer). This would mean that even when the flob is not skizzled, it still movates.\n\nBut this contradicts our original statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\", because now we have a situation where the flob movates regardless of whether it's skizzled or not. This would mean that being skizzled is not a necessary condition for the flob to movate.\n\nTherefore, our assumption \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob movated\" must be false, and we can conclude that \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
