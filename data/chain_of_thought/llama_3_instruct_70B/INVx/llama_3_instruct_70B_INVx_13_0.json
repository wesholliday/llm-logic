The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is indeed \"If not Q, then not P\", but it's not exactly what we have here.\n\nHowever, we can use a simple trick to convert our desired inference into the contrapositive form:\n\n\"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" is equivalent to \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\"\n\nNow, this is the contrapositive of the original statement. And in logic, the contrapositive of a true statement is also true.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer: \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
