            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This implies that if Mary was present, Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that Sue was not present at the wedding.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf Mary was indeed at the wedding (as per premise 1), then Sue must have been at the wedding as well. However, premise 2 suggests that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This creates a contradiction, implying that our initial assumption - \"Mary was at the wedding\" - must be false.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
