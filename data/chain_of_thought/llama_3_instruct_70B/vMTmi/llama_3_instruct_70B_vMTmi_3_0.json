            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"J \u2192 M\", where J represents \"the book was written by James\" and M represents \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel\".\n3. The conclusion states: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acJ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if J (the book was written by James), then M (the book must be a mystery novel) follows.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that \u00acM (it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nUsing modus tollens, which is a valid logical rule, we can infer:\n\nIf J \u2192 M and \u00acM, then \u00acJ\n\nIn other words, if it's true that \"if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel\", and it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel, then it follows logically that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
