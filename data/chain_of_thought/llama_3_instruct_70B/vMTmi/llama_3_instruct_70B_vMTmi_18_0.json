            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\".\n2. The second premise is \"The truck might not have been metal\". This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"it's possible that the truck was not metal\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The doll was not plastic\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if P (the doll was plastic), then M (the truck must have been metal). This implies that if \u00acM (the truck might not have been metal), then \u00acP (the doll was not plastic).\n\nThe second premise tells us that \u00acM is possible. Therefore, using modus tollens (a valid logical rule), we can conclude that \u00acP is also true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical structure:\n\nIf P \u2192 M\n\u00acM\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nAnswer: yes",
