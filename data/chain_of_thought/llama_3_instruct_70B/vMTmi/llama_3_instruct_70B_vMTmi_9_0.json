            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This implies that if Lisa buys the red shirt, it necessarily follows that Mark buys the blue shirt.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the conclusion: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" \n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to examine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. \n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to premise 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, premise 2 suggests that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction, implying that our initial assumption (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
