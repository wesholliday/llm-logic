            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants were denim\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acD\", which is equivalent to \"it's possible that the pants were not denim\".\n3. The conclusion states: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if C (the shirt was cotton), then D (the pants must have been denim) follows.\nFrom premise 2, we know that \u00acD (it's possible that the pants were not denim).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can infer from premises 1 and 2 that \u00acC (the shirt was not cotton). This is because if C \u2192 D and \u00acD, then \u00acC must be true.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
