            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acU\", which means \"it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest\".\n3. The conclusion states: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acG\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if G is true, then U must also be true (G \u2192 U).\nFrom premise 2, we know that it is possible that U is false (\u00acU).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can infer from premises 1 and 2 that:\n\nIf G were true, then U would have to be true (by premise 1), but since U might not be true (by premise 2), it follows that G cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (\u00acG) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
