            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"it is possible that the mummy was not awake\".\n3. The conclusion states: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if V is true, then M must also be true (V \u2192 M).\nFrom premise 2, we know that it is possible that M is false (\u00acM).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can infer from premises 1 and 2 that:\n\nIf V were true, then M would have to be true (V \u2192 M), but since M might not be true (\u00acM), it's possible that V is not true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake\" (\u00acV) follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
