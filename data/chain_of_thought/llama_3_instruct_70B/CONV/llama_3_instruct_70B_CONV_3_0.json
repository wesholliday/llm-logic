However, it doesn't provide any information about who might have written the book if it's a mystery novel.\n\nIn other words, just because James only writes mystery novels, it doesn't mean that all mystery novels are written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
