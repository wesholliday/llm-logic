This would be a conditional statement in the form of \"If Q, then P\".\n\nHowever, just because we know that \"If P, then Q\", it does not necessarily mean that \"If Q, then P\" is also true. This is a classic mistake in logic called \"converse error\".\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the street is wet\". Just because this is true, it doesn't mean that \"If the street is wet, then it's raining\" is also true (the street could be wet for other reasons).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" solely based on the given statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: no",
