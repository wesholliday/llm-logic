            "content": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThis implies a conditional relationship between two events:\n\n1. Lisa buying the red shirt (antecedent)\n2. Mark buying the blue shirt (consequent)\n\nNow, we're asked to consider the inverse implication: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's examine the original statement again:\n\n* If Lisa buys the red shirt, it guarantees that Mark buys the blue shirt.\n* However, there's no explicit information about what happens when Mark buys the blue shirt. It might be possible for Mark to buy the blue shirt without Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only provides a one-way implication: Lisa \u2192 Mark. It doesn't provide any information about the reverse direction: Mark \u2192 Lisa.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
