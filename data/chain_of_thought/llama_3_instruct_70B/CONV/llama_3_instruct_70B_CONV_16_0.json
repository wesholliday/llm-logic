This would be a conditional statement in the form of \"If Q, then P\".\n\nHowever, just because we know that \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily mean that \"If Q, then P\" is also true. This is a classic mistake in logic called \"converse error\".\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the streets are wet\". Just because this is true doesn't mean that \"If the streets are wet, then it's raining\" is also true (the streets could be wet for other reasons).\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: no",
