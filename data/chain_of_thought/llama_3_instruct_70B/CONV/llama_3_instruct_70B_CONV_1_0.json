However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\"\n\nThis statement would imply that if Sue attended the wedding, it is certain that Mary also attended. But our original statement does not provide enough information to guarantee this. \n\nFor example, it's possible that Sue attended the wedding without Mary being there. Our original statement only tells us about what happens when Mary attends, but it doesn't restrict Sue from attending independently.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
