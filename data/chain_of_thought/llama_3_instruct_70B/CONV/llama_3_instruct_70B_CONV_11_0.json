If the cake is chocolate, it guarantees that the muffins are blueberry. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, the cake must be chocolate.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that chocolate cake implies blueberry muffins, it doesn't automatically imply that blueberry muffins require a chocolate cake. There could be other scenarios where the muffins are blueberry but the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement alone, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
