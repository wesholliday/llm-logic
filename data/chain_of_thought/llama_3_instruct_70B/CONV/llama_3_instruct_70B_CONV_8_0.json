However, it does not necessarily imply the converse, i.e., whenever the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake.\n\nTo see why, consider a scenario where the mummy can be awake independently of the vampire's state. For instance, maybe the mummy has its own awakening mechanism that doesn't rely on the vampire being awake. In this case, it's possible for the mummy to be awake while the vampire is asleep.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" solely from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
