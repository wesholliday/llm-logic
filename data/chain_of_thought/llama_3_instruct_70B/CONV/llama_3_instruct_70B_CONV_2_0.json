However, it does not necessarily mean that if the unicorn is in the forest, the griffin must also be there.\n\nThink of a scenario where the unicorn could be in the forest without the griffin being present. This possibility cannot be ruled out based on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
