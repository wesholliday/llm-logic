It does not necessarily imply the converse, i.e., whenever Erin takes a train, Sam takes a plane.\n\nTo infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane,\" we would need to know that the original statement is an equivalence or a bi-conditional, meaning that both directions are true. However, the given statement only provides one direction of implication.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
