We are also given: \"The flugel might not have been zargled\" (possibility of not being zargled)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the flugel was blimmed, it must have been zargled (from statement 1).\n* But we know that the flugel might not have been zargled (from statement 2).\n\nThis creates a contradiction if the flugel was indeed blimmed. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that:\n\n* The flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
