            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can rewrite this as: \"Vroombed \u2192 Spended\" (using arrow notation for implication)\n3. We are also given: \"The dreb might not have been spened\" (possibility of negation)\n4. This implies: \"\u00acSpended is possible\" or \"It's possible that \u00acSpended\" (where \u00ac denotes negation)\n5. Now, let's consider the original conditional statement: \"Vroombed \u2192 Spended\"\n6. If Vroombed were true, then Spended would necessarily be true (by modus ponens).\n7. But we know that \u00acSpended is possible (from step 4). This means that Vroombed cannot be true, because if it were, Spended would have to be true, contradicting the possibility of \u00acSpended.\n8. Therefore, we can conclude: \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
