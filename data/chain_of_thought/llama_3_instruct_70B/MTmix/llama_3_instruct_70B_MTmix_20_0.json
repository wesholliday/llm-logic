            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Bluttered \u2192 Surned\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"It might not have been surned\". This implies that the possibility of \"not Surned\" exists.\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of \"Bluttered \u2192 Surned\" in conjunction with \"not Surned\". If it is true that \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\", and we know that it might not have been surned, then it is reasonable to conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered. This is because if the fleeg were bluttered, it would necessarily be surned (by the conditional statement), but since it might not be surned, the assumption of \"bluttered\" leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
