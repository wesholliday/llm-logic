We are also given: \"The zinger might not have been smoogled\" (there's a possibility that the zinger wasn't smoogled)\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if the zinger was indeed fraggled:\n\n* According to statement 1, if the zinger was fraggled, it must have been smoogled.\n* But statement 2 says there's a possibility that the zinger wasn't smoogled.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If the zinger was fraggled, it would have been smoogled (by statement 1), but statement 2 suggests it might not have been smoogled. This means our initial assumption - \"the zinger was fraggled\" - must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
