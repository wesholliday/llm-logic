We can rewrite this as: \"If fleeked, then snugged\" or symbolically: Fleeked \u2192 Snugged\n3. The second premise is: \"The clug might not have been snugged\" which implies that it's possible the clug was not snugged.\n4. Now, let's analyze the possibilities:\n   - If the clug was fleeked, then according to the conditional statement (1), it must have been snugged.\n   - But we know it's possible the clug was not snugged (3).\n   - Therefore, the only way to reconcile these two statements is if the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
