We are given: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" (implies that if snurgling happens, crinking must happen)\n2. We are also given: \"The fribble might not have crinked\" (there's a possibility that crinking didn't happen)\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if the fribble was indeed snurgled:\n\n* If the fribble was snurgled, then according to statement 1, it must have crinked.\n* But we know from statement 2 that there's a possibility that the fribble might not have crinked.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If the fribble was snurgled, it would have crinked (by statement 1), but we're told it might not have crinked (statement 2). This means our initial assumption - \"the fribble was snurgled\" - must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
