We can represent this as: Sploffed \u2192 PloppedFrink (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\")\n3. We are also given: \"The grommet might not have plopped the frink\" (possibility of negation)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acPloppedFrink (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\")\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sploffed \u2192 PloppedFrink is true, and we know that \u00acPloppedFrink might be true, then it would mean that the antecedent (Sploffed) cannot be true. Because if Sploffed were true, it would imply PloppedFrink, which contradicts the possibility of \u00acPloppedFrink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
