We can rewrite this as: \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" (contrapositive)\n3. We are also given: \"The glip might not have tragged\" (possibility of negation)\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\n* If the glip might not have tragged, it means there is a possibility that the glip was not tragged.\n* From step 2, if the glip was not tragged, then we can conclude that the glip was not slogged.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
