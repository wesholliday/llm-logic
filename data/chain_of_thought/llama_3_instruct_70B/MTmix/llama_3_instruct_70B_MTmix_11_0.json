We are also given: \"The flug might not have been zimmed\" (there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the flug was blummed, it must have been zimmed (from statement 1).\n* But we know that the flug might not have been zimmed (from statement 2).\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If the flug was blummed, it would imply that it was zimmed, but we are told that it might not be zimmed.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the flug was not blummed in the first place. This way, we avoid the implication that the flug must have been zimmed, which contradicts the possibility that it might not have been zimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
