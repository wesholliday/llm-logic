            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can rewrite this as: \"The splat was morphed \u2192 The splat quanked\" (using arrow notation for implication)\n3. Now, we are also given: \"The splat might not have quanked\", which means \"It is possible that the splat did not quank\"\n4. Since it's possible that the splat did not quank, and we know that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked (from step 2), we can conclude that:\n   - If the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked (by modus ponens)\n   - But it's possible that the splat did not quank (given in step 3)\n   - Therefore, it's possible that the splat was not morphed (because if it were, it would have quanked, but it might not have)\n\nSo, our conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
