We can rewrite this as: \"Shanked \u2192 Tinked\" (using arrow notation for implication)\n3. Now, we are also given: \"The whiffle might not have tinked\" (possibility of negation)\n4. This implies that it's possible that ~Tinked (not Tinked) is true\n5. If ~Tinked is true, then the conditional statement \"Shanked \u2192 Tinked\" would be false if Shanked were true (because Tinked would not follow)\n6. Therefore, to maintain the validity of the conditional statement, we must conclude that Shanked cannot be true if ~Tinked is possible\n7. Hence, we can infer: \"The whiffle was not shanked\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
