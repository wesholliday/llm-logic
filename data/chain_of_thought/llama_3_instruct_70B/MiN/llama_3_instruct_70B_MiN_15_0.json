It does not guarantee that they are not in the closet, but rather suggests that it's possible.\n\nNow, let's examine the inferred statement: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\" This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that the shoes have to be in the closet.\n\nIf we analyze these two statements, we can see that they are related. If there's a possibility that the shoes might not be in the closet (original statement), then it's reasonable to conclude that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet (inferred statement). In other words, if there's uncertainty about the shoes' location, we can't assume they must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
