This implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n2. We want to infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".\n3. To analyze this, let's consider what \"must have been\" means. It implies a necessity or certainty that the griffin was in the forest.\n4.
