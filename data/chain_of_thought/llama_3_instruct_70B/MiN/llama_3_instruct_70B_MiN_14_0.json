In other words, we cannot be certain that the milk is on the counter.\n\nNow, let's examine the inferred statement: \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\" This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that the milk has to be on the counter.\n\nIf we think about it, these two statements are actually equivalent. If there's a possibility that the milk might not be on the counter (original statement), then it means we can't guarantee that the milk must be on the counter (inferred statement). In other words, if there's uncertainty or doubt about the milk being on the counter, then we can't assert that it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
