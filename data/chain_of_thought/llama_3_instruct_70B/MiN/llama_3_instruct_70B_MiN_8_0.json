The original statement is \"The vampire might not have been awake.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" follows from this statement.\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider what \"must have been awake\" means. It implies a necessity or certainty that the vampire was awake.\n\nNow, if we say \"The vampire might not have been awake,\" it means there is some uncertainty or possibility that the vampire was not awake. This uncertainty contradicts the idea of necessity or certainty implied by \"must have been awake.\"\n\nTherefore, if there's a possibility that the vampire was not awake (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
