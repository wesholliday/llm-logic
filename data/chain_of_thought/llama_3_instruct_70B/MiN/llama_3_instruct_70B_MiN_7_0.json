This means that we cannot be certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that Alex finished the race.\n\nGiven that \"Alex might not have finished the race\" implies uncertainty about Alex finishing the race, we can infer that it's indeed possible that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, it's not necessarily true that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
