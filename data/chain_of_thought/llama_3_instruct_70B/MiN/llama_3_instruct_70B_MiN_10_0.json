The negation of \"the dog must have been inside\" would be \"it's not the case that the dog must have been inside\".\n3. If we know that the dog might not have been inside, it means that the statement \"the dog must have been inside\" cannot be true with absolute certainty.\n4. Therefore, if the dog might not have been inside, then it's indeed not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
