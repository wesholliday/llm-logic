            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. The phrase \"it's not the case that\" is equivalent to negation, so we can rephrase the question as \"Can we infer 'Lisa must not have bought the red shirt'\"?\n3. If Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, it means that there is a possibility she didn't buy it. This does not necessarily mean that she must not have bought it (there's still a chance she did).\n4. However, if Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then it would be impossible for her to not have bought it, which contradicts the initial statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\".\n5. Therefore, since the initial statement allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, we can infer that it's not necessarily true that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
