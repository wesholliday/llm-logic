The phrase \"it's not the case that\" is equivalent to negation, so we can rephrase the question as \"Is it true that Mary must not have been at the wedding?\"\n3. If Mary might not have been at the wedding, it means that her presence at the wedding is uncertain or unknown.\n4. If her presence is uncertain, then we cannot conclude that she must have been at the wedding (because there's a possibility she wasn't).\n5. Therefore, if Mary might not have been at the wedding, it implies that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
