The phrase \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" means that we cannot conclude with certainty that Jeff played basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements:\n\nIf Jeff might not have played basketball (i.e., it's possible he didn't), then it's reasonable to say that we can't be certain he did play basketball. In other words, if there's a chance he didn't play, then we can't conclude that he must have played.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid:\n\nAnswer: yes",
