This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must be\" implies a sense of necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not be\" implies a lack of necessity or uncertainty.\n4. If it's possible that the pen is not in the bag (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
