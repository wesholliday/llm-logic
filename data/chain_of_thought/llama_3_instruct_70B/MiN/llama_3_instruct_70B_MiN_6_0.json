The phrase \"it's not the case that\" is equivalent to negating the statement that follows.\n3. So, \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that it's not true that Sue necessarily chose pizza.\n\nNow, let's connect the dots:\n\nIf Sue might not have chosen pizza (i.e., there's a possibility she didn't), then it's indeed not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza. In other words, if there's uncertainty about her choice, we can't conclude that she definitely chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
