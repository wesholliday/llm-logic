This implies that there is a possibility that the book was not written by James.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" follows from this.\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider what \"must have been written by James\" means. It implies a necessity or a certainty that the book was written by James.\n\nNow, if we say \"The book might not have been written by James\", it means that there is some uncertainty or doubt about James being the author. This uncertainty is incompatible with the idea of necessity or certainty (i.e., \"must have been written by James\").\n\nTherefore, if there's a possibility that the book was not written by James, then it can't be the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
