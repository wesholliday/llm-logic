            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The toy might not be in the toy box\". This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n2. We want to infer whether \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" follows from this statement.\n3. \"Must be\" implies a sense of necessity or obligation, whereas \"might not be\" implies a lack of necessity or possibility of absence.\n4. If we say \"The toy might not be in the toy box\", it means that there is no guarantee or requirement for the toy to be in the toy box.\n5. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\", because if there was a necessity for the toy to be in the toy box, we wouldn't say \"might not be\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
