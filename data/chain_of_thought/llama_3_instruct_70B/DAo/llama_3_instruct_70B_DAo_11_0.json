This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"If not (cake was chocolate), then not (muffins were blueberry)\" using the rule of contrapositive.\n\nNow, we can apply this to our situation:\n\n3. Since \"The cake was not chocolate\" is true, we can use the rewritten conditional statement from step 2.\n4. Plugging in the truth value, we get \"If not (cake was chocolate) => not (muffins were blueberry)\".\n5. Since \"not (cake was chocolate)\" is true, we can infer that \"not (muffins were blueberry)\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
