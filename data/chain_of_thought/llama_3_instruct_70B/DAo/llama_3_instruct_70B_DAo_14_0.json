From the first statement, we know that the bear is not in the cave.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement. It says that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den. But since we already know the bear is not in the cave (from step 2), this conditional statement does not provide any information about the wolf's location.\n\n4. We cannot conclude anything about the wolf's presence or absence in the den based on the given statements. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the bear was in the cave, but that condition is not met.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wolf was not in the den' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
