            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (given premise).\n2. We also know \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (conditional statement).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditional statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This implies that if Mary is present, Sue must be present too.\n\nHowever, we already know that Mary was NOT at the wedding (from premise 1). So, the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's presence from the conditional statement. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Mary were present, but Mary is not present.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding\" solely based on these two premises. We need more information to determine Sue's attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
