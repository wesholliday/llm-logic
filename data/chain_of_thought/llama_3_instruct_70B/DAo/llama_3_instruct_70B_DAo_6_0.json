This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must be true.\n3. However, we already know that Sue did not choose pizza (from step 1). Therefore, the condition in the conditional statement is false.\n4. When the condition is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about the consequence (Bob choosing pasta).\n5. In other words, we cannot infer anything about Bob's choice based on this conditional statement.\n\nSo, can we infer \"Bob did not choose pasta\"? \n\nAnswer: no",
