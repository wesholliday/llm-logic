This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nNow, since we know that Joe did not go to the park (A is false), we can conclude that the condition for Lucy going to the zoo is not met. However, this does not directly imply that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nThink of it like this: just because Joe didn't go to the park, it doesn't mean Lucy couldn't have gone to the zoo for some other reason unrelated to Joe's actions. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Joe went to the park, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\".\n\nAnswer: no",
