This is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (vampire being awake) is true, then the second part (mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* Since the vampire is not awake (from step 1), the condition in the conditional statement is not met.\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the mummy's state from this conditional statement alone.\n\nHowever, we can think about it further: if the vampire was not awake, and the only way for the mummy to be awake is if the vampire is awake (as per the conditional statement), then it's likely that the mummy is also not awake. But this is more of an intuitive leap than a strict logical inference.\n\nSo, can we infer \"The mummy was not awake\" from the given statements? \n\nAnswer: no",
