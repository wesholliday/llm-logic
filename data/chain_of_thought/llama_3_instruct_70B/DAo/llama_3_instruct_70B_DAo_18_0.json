From the first statement, we know that the doll is not plastic.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement. It says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal. But we already know that the doll is not plastic (from step 2). So, this conditional statement does not apply in our scenario.\n\n4. Since the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is not true, we cannot conclude anything about the truck being metal or not metal based on this statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The truck was not metal' solely from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
