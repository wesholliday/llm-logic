This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Tom did not watch football (from step 1), the condition in the conditional statement is false. When the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence (Jen watching basketball). In other words, the conditional statement does not provide any information about Jen watching basketball when Tom doesn't watch football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball\". We simply don't have enough information to make a conclusion about Jen's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
