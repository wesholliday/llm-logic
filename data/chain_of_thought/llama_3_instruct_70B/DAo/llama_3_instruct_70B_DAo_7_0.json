This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Alex did not finish the race (given in step 1), the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is false. In this case, the conditional statement in step 2 does not provide any information about Chris finishing or not finishing the race. The consequence \"Chris finished the race\" only follows if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, which it's not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Chris did not finish the race\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
