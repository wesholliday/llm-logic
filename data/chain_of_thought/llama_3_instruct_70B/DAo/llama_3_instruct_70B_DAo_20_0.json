This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana was yellow) must be true.\n3. However, we know from step 1 that the antecedent \"The apple was red\" is actually false.\n4. Since the antecedent is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about the consequent \"The banana was yellow\". In other words, we cannot conclude anything about the banana's color based on this conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
