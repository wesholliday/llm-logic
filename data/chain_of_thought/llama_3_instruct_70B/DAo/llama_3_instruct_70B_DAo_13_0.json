This is a conditional statement, which means if the antecedent (the car was red) is true, then the consequent (the truck was blue) must be true.\n3. However, we know the antecedent is false (the car was not red). Therefore, the conditional statement does not provide any information about the consequent (the truck being blue).\n4. Since we don't have any direct or indirect evidence about the truck's color, we cannot infer that \"The truck was not blue\".\n\nAnswer: no",
