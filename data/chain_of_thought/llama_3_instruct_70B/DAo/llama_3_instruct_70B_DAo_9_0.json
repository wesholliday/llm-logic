This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Lisa did not buy the red shirt (P is false), we cannot conclude anything about Mark buying the blue shirt (Q) based on this conditional statement alone. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". We need more information to determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
