We are also given \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This can be rewritten as \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" (this is the contrapositive of the original statement).\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If Lucy might not have gone to the zoo (from step 1), and if Lucy did not go to the zoo implies that Joe did not go to the park (from step 2), then we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
