This implies that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n2. We are also given \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as:\n\n\"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" (using the contrapositive rule).\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. We know that \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\", which means there is a possibility that they were not blueberry.\n\n4. If we apply this to the rewritten conditional statement in step 2, we get: \"If the muffins were not blueberry (which is possible), then the cake was not chocolate\".\n\n5. Since we know that it's possible for the muffins to not be blueberry, and if they're not blueberry, then the cake must not have been chocolate, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
