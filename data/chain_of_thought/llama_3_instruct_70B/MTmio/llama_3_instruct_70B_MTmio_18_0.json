We are also given \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the truck might not have been metal (from step 1), and if the truck was not metal implies that the doll was not plastic (from step 2), then we can infer that the doll might not have been plastic.\n\n4. However, this is not exactly what we are asked to prove - \"The doll was not plastic\". We can only conclude that it's possible the doll was not plastic, but we cannot be certain.\n\nSo, after careful consideration...\n\nAnswer: no",
