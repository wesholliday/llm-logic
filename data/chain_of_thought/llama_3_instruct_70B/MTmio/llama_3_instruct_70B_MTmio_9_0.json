            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\". This implies that there is a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. We are also given \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as:\n\n\"If Lisa bought the red shirt \u2192 Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThis means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it necessarily implies that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt. If that were the case, then according to the conditional statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But this contradicts our initial statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\", which suggests that there is a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because if she had, it would imply that Mark bought the blue shirt, which contradicts our initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
