We also know \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\". This implies that if Sue did choose pizza, then Bob definitely chose pasta.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the scenario where Sue did choose pizza. In this case, according to statement 2, Bob must have chosen pasta. But this contradicts statement 1, which says Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\n4. Since we can't have a contradiction, it means that our initial assumption - \"Sue chose pizza\" - must be false. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
