This implies that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n2. We are also given \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\". This can be rewritten as \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" (this is called the contrapositive).\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the unicorn might not have been in the forest (from statement 1), and if the unicorn was not in the forest implies that the griffin was not in the forest (from statement 2), then we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
