We also know \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\". This implies that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris definitely finished the race.\n3. Now, let's consider the scenario where Alex did finish the race. In this case, according to statement 2, Chris must have finished the race as well. But this contradicts statement 1, which says Chris might not have finished the race.\n4. Since we can't have a contradiction, it means that our initial assumption - \"Alex did finish the race\" - must be false.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
