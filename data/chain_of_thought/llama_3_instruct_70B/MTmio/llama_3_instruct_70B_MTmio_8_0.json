We are also given \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\". This implies a conditional relationship between the vampire's state and the mummy's state. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that the vampire was awake. According to the second statement, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake too. But this contradicts our initial assumption that \"The mummy might not have been awake\". \n\n4. Since we cannot reconcile these two statements, it means that our initial assumption of the vampire being awake leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
