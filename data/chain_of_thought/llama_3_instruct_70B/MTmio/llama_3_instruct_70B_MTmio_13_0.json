We are also given \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" (this is called the contrapositive).\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the truck might not have been blue (from step 1), and if the truck was not blue implies that the car was not red (from step 2), then we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
