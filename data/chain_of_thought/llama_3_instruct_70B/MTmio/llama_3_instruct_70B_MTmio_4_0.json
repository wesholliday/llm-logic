This implies that there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\n2. We are also given \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\".\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the robot might not have visited Jupiter (from step 1), and if the robot did not visit Jupiter implies that the alien did not visit Mars (from step 2), then we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
