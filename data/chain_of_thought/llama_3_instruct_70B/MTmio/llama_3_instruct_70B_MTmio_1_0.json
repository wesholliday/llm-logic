            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\", which means it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n2. We are also given \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\". This implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 2, Sue must have been at the wedding as well. But this contradicts statement 1, which says it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nSince we can't reconcile these two statements if Mary was at the wedding, we conclude that Mary must not have been at the wedding. This way, we avoid the contradiction and maintain consistency with both statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
