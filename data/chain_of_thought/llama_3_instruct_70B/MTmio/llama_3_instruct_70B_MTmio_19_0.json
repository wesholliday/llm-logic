This implies that there is a possibility that Jen didn't watch basketball.\n\n2. We are also given \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\".\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation: if Tom watched football, then according to the conditional statement, Jen must have watched basketball. But we know that Jen might not have watched basketball (from step 1). \n\n4. This means that the assumption \"Tom watched football\" would lead to a contradiction with the fact \"Jen might not have watched basketball\". Therefore, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
