This implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"Fido might not be in the garden\". This means we can't confirm for sure that Fido is in the garden, but it doesn't rule out the possibility entirely.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement again: \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\". Since we know Fido might not be in the garden (from step 2), this means the only other option left is that Fido is inside.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, it seems reasonable to conclude that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
