This is an \"either-or\" statement, which implies that only one of the two options can be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\". This means we can eliminate the first option (cookies in the pantry) as a possibility.\n\n3. Since it's an \"either-or\" situation and we've eliminated the first option, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
