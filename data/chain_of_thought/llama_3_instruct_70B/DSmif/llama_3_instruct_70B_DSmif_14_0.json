We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there are only two possible scenarios: \n   a) The milk is chilling in the fridge\n   b) The milk is on the counter\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\". This implies that scenario (a) from above might not be true.\n\n4. Since we know that either scenario (a) or scenario (b) must be true (from Statement A), and scenario (a) might not be true (from Statement B), it is possible that scenario (b) \"The milk is on the counter\" is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
