This is an \"either-or\" statement, which implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. In other words, one of them must be true, and if one is false, the other must be true.\n3. We are given the additional information that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n4. Since the keys can't be dangling in the cabinet, and we know that they must be either in the cabinet or in the drawer, it logically follows that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
