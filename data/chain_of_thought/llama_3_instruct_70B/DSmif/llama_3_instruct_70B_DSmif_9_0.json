We are told that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means. If the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, then it can't be one of the two possible scenarios we initially considered. But we know that it must be one of those two scenarios (since they are the only options given). Therefore, if it's not blending in on the floor, it must be... in the box!\n\nAnswer: yes",
