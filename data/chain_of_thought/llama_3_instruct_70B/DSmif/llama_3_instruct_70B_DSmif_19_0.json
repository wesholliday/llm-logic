This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning one of them must be true.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The watch might not be on his wrist\". This implies that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement again. If the watch is not on his wrist (as suggested by the second statement), then it must be charging on the dresser, since these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
