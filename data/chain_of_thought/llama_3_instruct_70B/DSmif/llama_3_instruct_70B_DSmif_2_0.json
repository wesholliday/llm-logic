This implies that there are only two possible locations for the book: the table or the shelf.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The book might not be resting on the table\". This means that we cannot confirm with certainty that the book is on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean it's not on the table; it just means we can't rule out the possibility that it's not on the table.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possible locations for the book: the table and the shelf. If the book might not be resting on the table (as stated in 2), then there is a possibility that it's not on the table.\n\n4. Since there are only two possible locations (table or shelf) and we know the book might not be on the table, it follows logically that if it's not on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
