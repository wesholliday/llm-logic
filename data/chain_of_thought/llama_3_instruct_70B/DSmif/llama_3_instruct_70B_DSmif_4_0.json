We are given two statements: \n   a) Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n   b) The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible scenarios for the cat: either it's playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n\n3. Now, let's consider statement (b). It tells us that the first scenario (playing in the bedroom) is not true.\n\n4. Since the first scenario is not true and we have only two possibilities, the second scenario (napping on the couch) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
