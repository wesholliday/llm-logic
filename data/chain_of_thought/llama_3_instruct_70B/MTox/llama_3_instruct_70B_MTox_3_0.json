We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat did not quank\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"The splat was morphed \u2192 The splat quanked\"\n\n3. Now, we know that the splat did not quank (Statement A). If the splat was indeed morphed, then according to Statement B, it would have quanked. But since it didn't quank, our assumption that the splat was morphed must be incorrect.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
