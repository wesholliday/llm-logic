We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg did not surn\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"The fleeg was bluttered \u2192 The fleeg surned\"\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\n4. Since Statement A says \"The fleeg did not surn\", and Statement B implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, it would have surned, we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered. If it were bluttered, it would have surned, but it didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
