            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more familiar form: \"The grommet was sploffed \u2192 The grommet plopped the frink\". This is an implication, where if the antecedent (\"The grommet was sploffed\") is true, then the consequent (\"The grommet plopped the frink\") must also be true.\n\n3. Now, let's examine Statement A: \"The grommet did not plop the frink\". This means that the consequent of the implication in Statement B is false.\n\n4. Since the consequent is false, and the implication is of the form \"A \u2192 B\", we can conclude that the antecedent (\"The grommet was sploffed\") must also be false to maintain the validity of the implication. This is known as modus tollens.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
