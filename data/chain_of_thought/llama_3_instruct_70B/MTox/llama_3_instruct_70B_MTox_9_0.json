From the second statement, we can infer that if the twonk was plinked, it would have been varnished. But since we know from the first statement that the twonk was not varnished, it means that the condition \"the twonk was plinked\" cannot be true.\n\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
