            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket was not daggled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"If the sprocket is cranked, then it implies the sprocket is daggled\". This means that if the sprocket is cranked, we would expect it to be daggled.\n\n3. However, Statement A tells us that the sprocket was not daggled. This contradicts the implication from Statement B, which suggests that if the sprocket is cranked, it should be daggled.\n\n4. Since the sprocket is not daggled (Statement A), and being cranked implies being daggled (Statement B), we can conclude that the sprocket must not have been cranked. If it were cranked, it would be daggled, but it's not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
