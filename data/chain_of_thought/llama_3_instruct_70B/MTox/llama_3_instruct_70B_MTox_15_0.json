            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The dreb was not spened\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more familiar form: \"The dreb was vroombed \u2192 The dreb was spened\"\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"The dreb was not spened\". This means the consequent of the implication in Statement B is false.\n\n4. Now, let's analyze the implication in Statement B. If the antecedent (\"The dreb was vroombed\") were true, and the consequent (\"The dreb was spened\") is false, then the entire implication would be false. However, we know that Statement B is true.\n\n5. Therefore, for Statement B to remain true, the antecedent \"The dreb was vroombed\" must be false. This is because a false antecedent makes the implication true regardless of the consequent.\n\n6. Hence, we can conclude that \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
