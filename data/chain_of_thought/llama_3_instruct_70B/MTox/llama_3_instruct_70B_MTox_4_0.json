We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fribble did not crink\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"If the fribble crinked, then it was snurgled\" (This is the contrapositive of Statement B).\n\n3. Now, we know from Statement A that \"The fribble did not crink\". \n\n4. Using our rewritten Statement B, if the fribble did not crink, then it was not snurgled.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
