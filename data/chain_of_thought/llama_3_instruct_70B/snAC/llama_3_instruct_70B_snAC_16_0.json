But this does not necessarily mean that if the pants are denim, then the shirt must be cotton.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the antecedent (shirt is cotton) is true, then the consequent (pants are denim) will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the consequent is true but the antecedent is unknown or false.\n\nSince we know the pants are denim (statement 2), it could be that the shirt is cotton, but it could also be that the shirt is made of some other material and the pants just happen to be denim. We cannot conclude with certainty that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
