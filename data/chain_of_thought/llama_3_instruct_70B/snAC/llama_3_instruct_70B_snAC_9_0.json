But it doesn't necessarily mean that if Mark buys the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, it doesn't guarantee that Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
