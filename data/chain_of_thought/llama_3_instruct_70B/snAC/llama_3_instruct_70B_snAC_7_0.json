This implies a conditional relationship between Alex finishing the race and Chris finishing the race.\n2. We are also given that \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince \"Chris finished the race\" is true, we know that the consequence of the conditional statement (i.e., Chris finishing the race) has occurred.\n\nThe question is whether this necessarily implies that Alex finished the race. To determine this, we need to examine the conditional statement more closely.\n\nThe conditional statement says that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris to finish the race. However, it does not imply that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris to finish the race.\n\nIn other words, there could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, unrelated to Alex finishing the race. For example, maybe Chris was simply faster than everyone else and would have finished the race regardless of what Alex did.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
