However, this does not necessarily mean that the car being red is the only condition for the truck to be blue.\n\nWith statement 2, we know that the truck is indeed blue. But this could be due to various reasons, not just because the car was red.\n\nIn other words, there might be other conditions or scenarios where the truck would be blue, even if the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The car was red\" is true. There might be other explanations for why the truck is blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
