However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must be awake.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will be awake, but it does not provide any information about the converse (i.e., if the mummy is awake, the vampire might or might not be awake).\n\nGiven that the mummy is awake (statement 2), we cannot conclude with certainty that the vampire was awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake that have nothing to do with the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: no",
