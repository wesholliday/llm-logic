But this does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football.\n\nIn other words, just because Jen watched basketball, it doesn't guarantee that Tom watched football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nFor example, maybe Jen always watches basketball on Sundays, regardless of what Tom does. In this case, statement 2 is true (Jen watched basketball), but we can't conclude that statement \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
