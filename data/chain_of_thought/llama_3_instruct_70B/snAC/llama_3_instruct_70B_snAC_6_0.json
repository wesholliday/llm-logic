But it doesn't necessarily mean that Sue choosing pizza is the only way for Bob to choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know Bob chose pasta (statement 2).\n* According to statement 1, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n* However, there might be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue choosing pizza.\n\nSince we can't rule out other possibilities for Bob choosing pasta, we cannot conclude that Sue necessarily chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
