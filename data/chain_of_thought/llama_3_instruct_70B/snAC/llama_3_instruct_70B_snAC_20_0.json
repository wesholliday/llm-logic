But this doesn't necessarily mean that the apple is red.\n\nThink of it like this: just because a certain condition leads to a particular outcome, it doesn't mean that the condition itself is true. For example, \"If I study hard, then I will pass the exam\" doesn't mean I actually studied hard; maybe I just got lucky or the exam was easy!\n\nIn our case, we know the banana is yellow (statement 2), but that could be due to many reasons, not just because the apple is red. Maybe someone painted the banana yellow, or it's a special type of banana that's naturally yellow.\n\nSo, based on these two statements alone, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
