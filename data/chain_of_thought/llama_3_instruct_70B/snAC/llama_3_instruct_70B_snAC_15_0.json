But this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nThink of it like this: just because Erin took a train, it doesn't automatically imply that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam's actions.\n\nFor example, maybe Erin always takes the train, regardless of what Sam does. In this case, statement 2 (\"Erin took a train\") is true, but we can't conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
