            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (conditional statement)\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" (true statement)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too. This implies a causal relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nNow, given that Sue was indeed at the wedding (statement 2), we can try to infer something about Mary's presence.\n\nHowever, just because Sue was at the wedding doesn't necessarily mean Mary was also there. There could be other reasons why Sue attended the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We can't conclude that Mary was at the wedding simply because Sue was there and we have a conditional statement linking the two.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
