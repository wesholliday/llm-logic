We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sneg was crampled\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is true, then the consequence \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the sneg was crampled\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"the sneg was crampled\" is true (which it is), then \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
