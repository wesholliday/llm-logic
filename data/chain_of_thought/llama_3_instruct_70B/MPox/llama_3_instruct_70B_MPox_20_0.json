We have two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg was bluttered\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (Conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the first part (\"The fleeg was bluttered\") is true, then the second part (\"it surned\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"The fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
