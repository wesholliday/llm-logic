We are given two statements:\n   - \"The clug was fleeked\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the first part (\"the clug was fleeked\") is true, then the second part (\"the clug snugged\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know \"The clug was fleeked\" is true from Premise 1, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, if \"the clug was fleeked\" is true and the conditional statement is true, then \"the clug snugged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
