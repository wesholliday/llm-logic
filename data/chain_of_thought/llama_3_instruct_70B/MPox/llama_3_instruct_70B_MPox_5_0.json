We are given two statements:\n   - \"The zinger was fraggled\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the zinger was fraggled\" is true, then the consequence \"the zinger was smoogled\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the zinger was fraggled\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that if the condition is true (the zinger was fraggled), then the consequence must also be true: \"The zinger was smoogled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
