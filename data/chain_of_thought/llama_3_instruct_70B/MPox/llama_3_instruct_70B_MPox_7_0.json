We are given two statements:\n   - \"The whiffle was shanked\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" is true, then the consequence \"the whiffle tinked\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the whiffle was shanked\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"the whiffle was shanked\" is true (which it is), then \"the whiffle tinked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
