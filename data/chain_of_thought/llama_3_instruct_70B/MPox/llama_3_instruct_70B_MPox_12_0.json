We are given two statements:\n   - \"The smip was shripped\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the premise \"The smip was shripped\" is true, then the conclusion \"the smip lupped the zoint\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we are given that Premise 1 (\"The smip was shripped\") is true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
