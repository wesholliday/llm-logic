The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it was varnished\".\n3. We are also given that P is true, since the first statement says \"The twonk was plinked\".\n4. Using modus ponens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that if P \u2192 Q and P are both true, then Q must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"It was varnished\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
