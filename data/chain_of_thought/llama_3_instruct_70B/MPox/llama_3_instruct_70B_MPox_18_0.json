We are given two statements:\n   - \"The shank was plooked\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the shank was plooked\" is true, then the consequence \"the shank was nugged\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the shank was plooked\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"the shank was plooked\" is true (which it is), then \"the shank was nugged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
