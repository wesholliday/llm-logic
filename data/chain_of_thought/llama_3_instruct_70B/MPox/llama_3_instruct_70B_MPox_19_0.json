We have two statements:\n   - \"The smonk was vreebled\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the first part (\"the smonk was vreebled\") is true, then the second part (\"the smonk plagged\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know \"The smonk was vreebled\" is true from Premise 1, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"The smonk was vreebled\" is true, then \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
