We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flug was blummed\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the flug was blummed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the flug was blummed\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"the flug was blummed\" is true (which it is), then \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
