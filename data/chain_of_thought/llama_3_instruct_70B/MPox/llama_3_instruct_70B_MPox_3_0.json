We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat was morphed\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the consequence \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the splat was morphed\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"the splat was morphed\" is true (which it is), then \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
