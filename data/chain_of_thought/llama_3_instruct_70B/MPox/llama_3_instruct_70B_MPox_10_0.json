We have two statements:\n   - \"The wug was sproinged\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (Conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" is true, then the consequence \"it was garpled\" must also be true.\n\n3. We are given that Premise 1 (\"The wug was sproinged\") is true.\n\n4. Since the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied (the wug was indeed sproinged), we can infer that the consequence must also be true, which is \"it was garpled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
