We have two statements:\n   - \"The dreb was vroombed\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" (Conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the consequence \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the dreb was vroombed\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true (which it is), then \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
