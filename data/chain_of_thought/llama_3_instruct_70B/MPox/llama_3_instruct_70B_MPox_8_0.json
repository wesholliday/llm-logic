We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket was cranked\" (a fact)\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" (an implication)\n\n2. The implication states that if the first condition (\"the sprocket was cranked\") is true, then the second condition (\"the sprocket was daggled\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know \"The sprocket was cranked\" to be true (from the fact), we can apply the implication.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the implication, if \"The sprocket was cranked\" is true, then \"The sprocket was daggled\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
