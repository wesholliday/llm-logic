The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n   p \u2192 q\n   where p = 'The flob was skizzled' and q = 'The flob movated'\n\n3. We are also given that p is true ('The flob was skizzled'). \n\n4. Now, we need to determine if we can infer q ('The flob movated').\n\n5. Since p \u2192 q is true, and p is true, we can apply modus ponens (a rule of inference) which states that if p \u2192 q is true and p is true, then q must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The flob movated' is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
