We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet was sploffed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as:\n   - \"The grommet was sploffed \u2192 The grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"The grommet was sploffed\" is true.\n\n4. Since the condition in Statement B (\"The grommet was sploffed\") is true (from Step 3), we can infer the conclusion:\n   - \"The grommet plopped the frink\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
