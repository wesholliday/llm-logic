This can be represented as \"F \u2228 S\" (where F means \"the zinger is fraggled\" and S means \"it must be smoogled\").\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (where \u00ac denotes negation).\n3. From step 1, we have F \u2228 S. Using the rule of inference called \"disjunctive syllogism\", if we know that one of the disjuncts is false (in this case, \u00acS), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true.\n4. Therefore, from F \u2228 S and \u00acS, we can conclude that F must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
