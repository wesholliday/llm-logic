This is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\". This is equivalent to saying \"The flob does not have to be movated\".\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. We know that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. But we've just learned that it doesn't have to be movated.\n\n4. Since it can't be movated, and one of the two options in the \"or\" statement must be true, the only remaining option is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
