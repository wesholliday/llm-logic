However, this contradicts the second statement, which says it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\n\nTherefore, since the second option (it must be sproted) is eliminated by the second statement, and the first statement requires one of the two options to be true, we are left with only one possibility: the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
