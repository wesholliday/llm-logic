This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the fribble is snurgled\" and B = \"it must be crinked\".\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\". This can be represented as \"not B\".\n3. From step 1, we know that A or B is true.\n4. But from step 2, we know that B is false (since it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked).\n5. Therefore, since A or B is true and B is false, A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
