This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. We also have the statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\". This is a negation of the second option in the disjunction.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies:\n\n* If it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled, then the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n* Since we know that at least one of the two options must be true (from the disjunction), and the second option is ruled out, we can conclude that the first option must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
