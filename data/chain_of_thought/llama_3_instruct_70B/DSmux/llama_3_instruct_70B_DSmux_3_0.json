This can be represented as \"M \u2228 Q\", where M represents \"the splat is morphed\" and Q represents \"it must be quanked\".\n2. We also have the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\". This can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. From \u00acQ, we know that Q is false.\n4. Since M \u2228 Q is true, and Q is false, the only way for M \u2228 Q to be true is if M is true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\" (M) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
