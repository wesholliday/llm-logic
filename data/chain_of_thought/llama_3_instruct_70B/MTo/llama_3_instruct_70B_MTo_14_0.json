            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The wolf was not in the den\" (denoted as \u00acW, where W means \"the wolf is in the den\")\n   - \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (denoted as B \u2192 W, where B means \"the bear is in the cave\")\n\n2. We want to infer whether \"The bear was not in the cave\" (\u00acB) can be concluded from these two statements.\n\n3. Let's analyze the second statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (B \u2192 W). This implies that if B is true, then W must also be true. However, we know that W is false (\u00acW), so for the implication to hold, B cannot be true.\n\n4. Therefore, since \u00acW and B \u2192 W, we can conclude that \u00acB, which means \"The bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
