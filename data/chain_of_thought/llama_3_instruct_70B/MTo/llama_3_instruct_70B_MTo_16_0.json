From the second statement, we can deduce that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton (because if the shirt were cotton, the pants would have been denim, which contradicts our first statement).\n\n3. Since we know the pants were not denim (from the first statement), we can apply our deduction from step 2: The shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
