We also know \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (conditional statement).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditional statement: if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding too. But we already know that Sue was not at the wedding (from premise 1). This means that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" cannot be true, because if it were, Sue would have been at the wedding, which contradicts our initial premise.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
