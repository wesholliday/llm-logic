This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then according to the conditional statement, Erin would have taken a train. But we know that Erin did not take a train (from step 1).\n* Therefore, it cannot be the case that Sam took a plane, because if he did, Erin would have taken a train, which contradicts our initial information.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
