We are given two statements:\n   - \"The muffins were not blueberry\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" (This is the contrapositive of Statement B, which is logically equivalent).\n\n3. Now, we are given that Statement A (\"The muffins were not blueberry\") is true.\n\n4. Using the rewritten Statement B, we can conclude that if the muffins were not blueberry (which is true), then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, \n\nAnswer: yes",
