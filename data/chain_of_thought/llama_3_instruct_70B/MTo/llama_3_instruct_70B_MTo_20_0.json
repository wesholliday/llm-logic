            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The banana was not yellow\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more logical form: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\". This is because if the condition \"the apple was red\" leads to \"the banana was yellow\", then the opposite must also be true - if the banana is not yellow, the apple cannot be red.\n\n3. Now we can use Statement A, which tells us that \"The banana was not yellow\".\n\n4. Combining this with our rewritten Statement B, we get: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\". Since we know the banana was not yellow (Statement A), we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
