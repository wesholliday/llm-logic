This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Joe had gone to the park, then according to the conditional statement, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. But we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (from step 1).\n* Therefore, it must be the case that Joe did not go to the park, because if he had, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, which is contradictory to what we know.\n\nAnswer: yes",
