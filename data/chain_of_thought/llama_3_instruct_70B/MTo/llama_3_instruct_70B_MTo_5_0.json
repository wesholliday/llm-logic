This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\".\n3. Since we know Amy did not play tennis (from step 1), the consequent of the conditional statement (\"Amy played tennis\") is false.\n4. In a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false to avoid a contradiction. Therefore, \"Jeff played basketball\" must be false.\n5. Hence, we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
