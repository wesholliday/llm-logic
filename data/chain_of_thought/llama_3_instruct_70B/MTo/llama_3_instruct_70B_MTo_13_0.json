            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck was not blue\" (fact)\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the car is red, the truck must be blue. However, we know from the fact that the truck is not blue.\n\n3. Now, let's consider two possible scenarios for the car:\n   - Scenario 1: The car is red.\n   - Scenario 2: The car is not red.\n\n4. If Scenario 1 (the car is red) were true, then according to the conditional statement, the truck would be blue. But we know that's not the case, so Scenario 1 must be false.\n\n5. Therefore, Scenario 2 (the car is not red) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
