We are also given \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Lisa buys red shirt \u2192 Mark buys blue shirt\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the conditional statement, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. But we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (from step 1).\n* Therefore, it must be the case that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because if she had, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
