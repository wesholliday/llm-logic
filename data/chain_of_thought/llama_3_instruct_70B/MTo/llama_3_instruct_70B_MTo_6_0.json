This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must be true.\n3. Since we know Bob did not choose pasta (from step 1), it means the consequence of the conditional statement is false.\n4. For the conditional statement to be true, the condition (Sue choosing pizza) must also be false, because if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, which contradicts what we know.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
