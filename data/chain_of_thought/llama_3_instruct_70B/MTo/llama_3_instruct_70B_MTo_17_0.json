This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Ben had eaten pasta, then according to the conditional statement, Kate would have eaten the salad. But we know that Kate did not eat the salad (from step 1).\n* Therefore, it must be the case that Ben did not eat pasta, because if he had, Kate would have eaten the salad, which is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
