This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Tom had watched football, then according to the conditional statement, Jen would have watched basketball.\n* But we know that Jen did not watch basketball (from step 1).\n* Therefore, it must be the case that Tom did not watch football. If he had, then Jen would have watched basketball, which contradicts our initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
