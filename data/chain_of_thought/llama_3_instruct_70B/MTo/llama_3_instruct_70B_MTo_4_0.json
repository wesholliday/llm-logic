We are given two statements:\n   - The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n   - If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n2. From the second statement, we can see that if the alien visited Mars, it would imply that the robot visited Jupiter. However, this contradicts our first statement, which says the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\n3. Therefore, for the two statements to be true simultaneously, it must be the case that the alien did not visit Mars. If the alien had visited Mars, then according to the second statement, the robot would have visited Jupiter, but we know that's not true.\n\n4. Hence, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
