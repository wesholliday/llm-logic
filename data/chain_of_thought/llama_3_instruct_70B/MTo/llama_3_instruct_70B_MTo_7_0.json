We also know \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (given). This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Alex finished \u2192 Chris finished\".\n3. Since we know Chris did not finish the race, we can conclude that the condition \"Chris finished\" is false.\n4. Now, let's analyze the conditional statement again: \"Alex finished \u2192 Chris finished\". If the consequence \"Chris finished\" is false, then the antecedent \"Alex finished\" must also be false (because if Alex had finished, then Chris would have finished, but we know Chris didn't).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
