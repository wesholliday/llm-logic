            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - The unicorn was not in the forest (U)\n   - If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (G \u2192 U)\n\n2. From statement U, we know that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement G \u2192 U. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (G) is true, then the consequence (U) must also be true. However, since we already know that U is false (the unicorn was not in the forest), this implies that the condition G cannot be true.\n\n4. If G were true, it would imply that U is true, but we know U is false. Therefore, G must be false to maintain the validity of the conditional statement G \u2192 U.\n\n5. Hence, from the given statements, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest (\u00acG).\n\nAnswer: yes",
