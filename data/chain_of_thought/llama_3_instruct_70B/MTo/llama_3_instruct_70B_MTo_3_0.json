We also know \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (given). This can be rewritten as \"If the book is written by James, then it must be a mystery novel\".\n3. Since we know the book is not a mystery novel (from step 1), and if James wrote it, it would be a mystery novel (from step 2), we can conclude that James did not write the book.\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
