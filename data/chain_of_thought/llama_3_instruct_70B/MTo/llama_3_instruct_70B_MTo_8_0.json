This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then according to the conditional statement, the mummy would also be awake. But we know that the mummy is not awake.\n* Therefore, it cannot be the case that the vampire is awake, because if it were, the mummy would be awake too.\n\nSo, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
