From the second statement, we can deduce that if the doll was plastic, it would imply the truck is metal. However, this contradicts our first statement, which says the truck was not metal.\n\n3. Therefore, for the two statements to be true simultaneously, the assumption \"the doll was plastic\" must be false. This is because if the doll were indeed plastic, it would lead to a contradiction with the fact that the truck is not metal.\n\n4. Hence, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
