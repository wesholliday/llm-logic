In other words, it's possible for the pen to be elsewhere.\n\nNow, can we infer that the pen might not be in my bag? Well, if there's no necessity for the pen to be in my bag, then it's certainly possible that it's not in my bag. The absence of a requirement or guarantee doesn't necessarily mean the pen is definitely not in my bag, but it does leave open the possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
