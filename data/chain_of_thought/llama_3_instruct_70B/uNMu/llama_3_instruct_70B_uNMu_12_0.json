It doesn't have to be there.\n\nNow, can we infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair? Well, if it's not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair, then it's possible that it's not actually draped over the chair. There's no obligation or requirement for it to be there, so it could be somewhere else or not present at all.\n\nAnswer: yes",
