It simply means that it's not required to be there.\n\nIn other words, the absence of a necessity or requirement doesn't imply the presence of an impossibility. The watch might still be charging on the dresser, but it's not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, but we can't conclude that it definitely isn't charging there either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
