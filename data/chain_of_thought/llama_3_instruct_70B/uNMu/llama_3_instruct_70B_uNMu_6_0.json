The statement says \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This means that we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that Sue chose pizza.\n2. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether Sue actually did choose pizza or not. It only tells us that we can't be 100% sure she did.\n3. The question asks if we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza. In other words, is it possible that Sue didn't choose pizza?\n\nGiven the information, we can indeed infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza. This is because the original statement only rules out absolute certainty about Sue choosing pizza, but it doesn't provide any evidence or guarantee that she did choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
