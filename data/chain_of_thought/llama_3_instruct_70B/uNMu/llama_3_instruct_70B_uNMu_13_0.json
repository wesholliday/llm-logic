In other words, the toy's presence in the toy box is not guaranteed or obligatory.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box because there is no constraint or obligation for it to be there. The absence of a \"must\" implies that there are other possibilities, including the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
