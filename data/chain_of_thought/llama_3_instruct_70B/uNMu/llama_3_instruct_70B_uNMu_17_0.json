It doesn't have to be there.\n\nNow, can we infer that the scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack? Well, if it's not necessary for the scarf to be in the backpack, then it's possible that it's not actually in the backpack. There's no obligation or requirement for it to be there, so it could be elsewhere or not in the backpack at all.\n\nAnswer: yes",
