The statement says \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\" This means that we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the griffin was in the forest.\n2. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the griffin could have been in the forest or not. It only tells us that we can't be 100% sure it was there.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the absence of certainty (it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest) does not necessarily imply uncertainty or doubt (the griffin might not have been in the forest). There is a subtle distinction between these two concepts.\n\nAnswer: yes",
