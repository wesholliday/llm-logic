It doesn't have to be there.\n\nNow, can we infer that the newspaper might not be in the driveway? Well, if it's not necessary for the newspaper to be in the driveway, then it's possible that it's not actually there. There's no guarantee or requirement for its presence, so it could be absent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
