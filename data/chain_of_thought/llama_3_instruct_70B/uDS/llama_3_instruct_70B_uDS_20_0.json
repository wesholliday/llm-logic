We know that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head (this is an \"either-or\" statement, which means one of the two options must be true).\n2. We also know that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies:\n\nIf the sunglasses aren't perched on her head, and we know that they are either in her bag or on her head, then it must be the case that they are in her bag. This is because if they're not on her head, the only other option (according to the initial statement) is that they're in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
