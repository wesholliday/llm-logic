This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are also told that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom step 3, we know that one of the two possibilities (hiding under the couch) is false. Since these two options are mutually exclusive, if one is false, the other must be true.\n\nTherefore, since the remote control isn't hiding under the couch, it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
