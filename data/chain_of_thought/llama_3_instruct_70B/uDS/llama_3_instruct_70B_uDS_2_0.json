This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are then told that the book isn't resting on the table.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that if the book isn't resting on the table, it must be on the shelf. This is because we have eliminated one of the two possibilities, leaving only one option remaining.\n\nAnswer: yes",
