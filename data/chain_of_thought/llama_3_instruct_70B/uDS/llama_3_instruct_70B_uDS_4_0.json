This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are also told that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom step 3, we know that the \"playing in the bedroom\" option is false. Since the two options are mutually exclusive (step 2), this means that the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
