This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n3. We are then told that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that if the puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, it must be in the box. This is because we have eliminated one of the two possibilities, leaving only one option remaining.\n\nAnswer: yes",
