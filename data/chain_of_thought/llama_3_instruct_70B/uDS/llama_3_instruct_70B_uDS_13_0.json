This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and there are no other possibilities.\n3. We are then told that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box. If it's not on the shelf, and those are the only two options, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
