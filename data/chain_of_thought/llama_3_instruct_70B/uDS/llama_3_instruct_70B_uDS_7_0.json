This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning the umbrella can't be in both places at the same time.\n3. We are also told that the umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that if the umbrella is not in the closet, it must be in the car. This is because we've eliminated one of the two possible locations, leaving only one option remaining.\n\nAnswer: yes",
