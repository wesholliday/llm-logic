This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are then told that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means:\n\n* If the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, it means that option 2 is eliminated.\n* Since we know that one of the two options must be true (either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand), and option 2 is no longer possible...\n* ...it logically follows that the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
