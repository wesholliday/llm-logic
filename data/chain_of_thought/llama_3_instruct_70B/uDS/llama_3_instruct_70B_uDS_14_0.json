This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are then told that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This means that the second option (milk is chilling in the fridge) is eliminated.\n4. Since we know that one of the two options must be true, and the second option is false, it logically follows that the first option (milk is on the counter) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
