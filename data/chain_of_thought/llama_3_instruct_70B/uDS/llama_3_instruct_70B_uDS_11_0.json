This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are then told that the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means:\n\n* If the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch, it means that the second option is eliminated.\n* Since we know that one of the two options must be true (either it's in the driveway or it's on the porch), and the porch option is eliminated, it leaves us with only one possibility: the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
