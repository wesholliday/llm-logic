The sprocket was daggled (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the sprocket is cranked, it implies that it is also daggled. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the sprocket is daggled, it must have been cranked.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that crank \u2192 daggled, but it does not guarantee that daggled \u2192 crank.\n\nGiven statement 2, we know that the sprocket is indeed daggled. However, this alone is not enough to conclude that the sprocket was cranked, because there might be other reasons why the sprocket is daggled (e.g., it could have been daggled by some other means).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The sprocket was cranked\".\n\nAnswer: no",
