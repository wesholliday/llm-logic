The smonk plagged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. This is a conditional statement, where being vreebled is the condition and plagging is the consequence.\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that the smonk indeed plagged.\n\nThe question is whether we can infer that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTo answer this, let's think about it: if the smonk plagged (which we know it did), and being vreebled is a condition that leads to plagging (from statement 1), then it seems reasonable to conclude that the smonk must have been vreebled in order for it to have plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
