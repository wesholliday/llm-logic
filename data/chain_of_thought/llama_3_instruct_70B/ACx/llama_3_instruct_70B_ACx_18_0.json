The shank was nugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shank is plooked, it implies that the shank is nugged. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the shank is nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the shank is indeed nugged. But we cannot conclude from this alone that the shank was plooked. There might be other reasons why the shank is nugged, unrelated to being plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The shank was plooked\".\n\nAnswer: no",
