The fribble crinked (assertion of the consequent)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The fribble was snurgled\" from these two premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. This implies a causal relationship between being snurgled and crinking.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that the fribble indeed crinked. Now, we can use modus ponens to infer the antecedent (the \"if\" part) from the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n\nSince the fribble crinked, and being snurgled leads to crinking, it is reasonable to conclude that the fribble was indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
