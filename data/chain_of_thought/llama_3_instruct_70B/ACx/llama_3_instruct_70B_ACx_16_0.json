The sneg sproted the frink (conclusion)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The sneg was crampled\" from these two statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. This implies a causal relationship between the sneg being crampled and it sprotting the frink.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the sneg did indeed sprot the frink. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sneg was crampled. There could be other reasons why the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because we know the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) and the conditional statement, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg was crampled\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
