The whiffle tinked (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. This implies a causal relationship between \"shanked\" and \"tinked\".\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that the whiffle indeed tinked.\n\nThe question is whether we can infer that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nSince we know that the whiffle tinked (statement 2), and we also know that if it was shanked, then it would have tinked (statement 1), it seems reasonable to conclude that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
