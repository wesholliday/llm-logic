The fleeg surned.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned. This implies a causal relationship between \"the fleeg being bluttered\" and \"it surning\".\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that the fleeg did indeed surn.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude that if the fleeg surned (which it did), and surning implies that the fleeg was bluttered (from statement 1), then it is likely that the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
