This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n3. We are also told that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means that the second option is false.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning:\n\n* Since the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, if the second option (blending in on the floor) is false, then the first option (in the box) must be true.\n* In other words, if it's not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
