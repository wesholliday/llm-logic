This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means one of the two options must be true.\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that the option \"cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" is false.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies:\n\n* If the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (which we know to be true), then the only other possibility is that they are in the jar.\n* Since one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and the \"pantry\" option is false, the remaining option \"cookies are in the jar\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
