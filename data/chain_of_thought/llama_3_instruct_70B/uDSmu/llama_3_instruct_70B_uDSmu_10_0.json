This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and they can't both be true at the same time.\n3. We are also told that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the possibility of the sock being under the bed is eliminated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince there are only two possibilities (laundry basket or under the bed), and one of them (under the bed) has been ruled out, we are left with only one option: the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
