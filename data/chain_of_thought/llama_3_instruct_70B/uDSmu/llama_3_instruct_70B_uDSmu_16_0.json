This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n2. We are also told that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This means that the possibility of the pen being on my desk is ruled out.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies:\n\nSince we know that either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk (from step 1), and we've eliminated the possibility of it being on my desk (from step 2), we are left with only one option: the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
