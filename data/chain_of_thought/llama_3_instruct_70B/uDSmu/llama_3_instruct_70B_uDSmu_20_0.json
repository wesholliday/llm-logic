This is an \"or\" statement, which means one of the two options must be true.\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the option \"they must be perched on her head\" is false.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies:\n\n* If the option \"they must be perched on her head\" is false, then the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n* Since one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and the other option is false (from step 2), we can conclude that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
