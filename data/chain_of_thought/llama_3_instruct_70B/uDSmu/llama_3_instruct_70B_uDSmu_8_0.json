This means that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them must be true.\n\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This implies that the possibility of the remote control being under the couch is eliminated.\n\n3. Since we have already established that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch, and now we know that it can't be under the couch, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
