This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand is eliminated.\n4. Since we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 2), and the nightstand option has been eliminated, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
