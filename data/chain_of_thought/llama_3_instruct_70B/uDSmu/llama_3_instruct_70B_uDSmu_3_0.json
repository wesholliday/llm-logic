We know that either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet (this is an \"or\" statement, which means one of the options must be true).\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet (this negates the second option).\n\nNow, let's think about what this means:\n\n* If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (which we know is true), then the only other possibility is that they are in the drawer.\n* Since one of the options must be true (from step 1), and the cabinet option is ruled out, the remaining option - the keys being in the drawer - must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
