This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, and if one is not true, the other must be true.\n3. We are also told that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the option \"the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is false.\n4. Since the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, if the second option is false, then the first option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
