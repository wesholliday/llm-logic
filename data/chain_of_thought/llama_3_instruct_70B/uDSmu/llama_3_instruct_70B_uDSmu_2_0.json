We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n   b) It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible scenarios: \n   i) The book is on the shelf\n   ii) The book must be resting on the table\n\n3. However, statement (b) tells us that scenario (ii) cannot be true. Therefore, we can eliminate this possibility.\n\n4. Since scenario (ii) is not possible, and there are only two scenarios according to statement (a), we are left with scenario (i): The book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
