This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n3. We are also told that it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom step 3, we can conclude that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet (because it's not the case that it must be).\n\nNow, going back to step 2, since the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
