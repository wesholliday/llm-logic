This is an \"or\" statement, which means one of the two options must be true.\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door. This means that the second option (shoes lined up by the door) is false.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies:\n\n* If the second option (shoes lined up by the door) is false, then the first option (shoes in the closet) must be true. This is because we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and since the second option is false, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
