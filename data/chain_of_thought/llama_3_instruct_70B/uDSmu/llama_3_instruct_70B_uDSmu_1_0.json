We are given: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be represented as a logical disjunction: Inside \u2228 MustBeGarden\n2. We are also given: \"it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be represented as the negation of MustBeGarden: \u00acMustBeGarden\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (\u00acMustBeGarden), and we have a disjunction stating that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden (Inside \u2228 MustBeGarden), we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
