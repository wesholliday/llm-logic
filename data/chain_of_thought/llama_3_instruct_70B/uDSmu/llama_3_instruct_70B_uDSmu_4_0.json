This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning if one is true, the other must be false.\n3. We are also told that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means that the option \"playing in the bedroom\" can be eliminated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we have only two options, and one of them (\"playing in the bedroom\") is ruled out, we are left with only one possibility: the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
