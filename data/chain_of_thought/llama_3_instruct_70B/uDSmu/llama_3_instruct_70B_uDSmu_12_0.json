This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n3. We are also told that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom step 3, we can infer that the option \"it must be hanging in the closet\" is false.\n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (step 2), if one of them is false, the other must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
