This means that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them must be true.\n\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. This implies that the possibility of the scarf being draped on the coat rack is eliminated.\n\n3. Since we have already established that either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack, and the latter option has been ruled out, we are left with only one possibility: the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
