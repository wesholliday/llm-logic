It does not provide any information about whether they must or must not be in her bag, only that it's possible they're not.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nIf the sunglasses might not be in her bag, it means that there is a possibility of them not being in her bag. This implies that it's not necessarily true that the sunglasses must be in her bag. In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that they must be in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
