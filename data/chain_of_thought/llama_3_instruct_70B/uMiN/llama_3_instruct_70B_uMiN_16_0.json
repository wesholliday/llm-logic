It does not provide any information about whether the pen must or must not be in my bag, only that it might not be.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nIf the pen must be in my bag, it means that it is necessarily true that the pen is in my bag. However, our original statement suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not in my bag, which contradicts the idea that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
