It does not provide any information about whether the milk must or must not be on the counter, only that it might not be.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nIf the milk must be on the counter, it means that it is necessarily true that the milk is on the counter. However, our original statement suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, which contradicts the idea that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
