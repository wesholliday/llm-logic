It does not provide any information about whether they must or must not be in the closet, only that it's possible they're not.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nIf the shoes might not be in the closet, it means that there is a possibility of them not being in the closet. This implies that it's not necessarily true that the shoes must be in the closet. In other words, the statement \"the shoes might not be in the closet\" contradicts the idea that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
