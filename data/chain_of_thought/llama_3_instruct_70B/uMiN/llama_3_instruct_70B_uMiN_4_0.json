In other words, it is not certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nIf the alien must have visited Mars, it would mean that it is necessarily true that the alien visited Mars. However, our initial statement suggests that this might not be the case.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, we can conclude that it's not necessarily true that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
