This means that we cannot be certain that she bought the red shirt.\n\nOn the other hand, the phrase \"it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is equivalent to saying that it's false that Lisa definitely bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven that we know Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, it means that we cannot conclude with certainty that she bought the red shirt. Therefore, it's indeed not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
