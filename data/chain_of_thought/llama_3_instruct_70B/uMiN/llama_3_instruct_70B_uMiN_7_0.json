This means that we cannot be certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\" This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that Alex definitely finished the race.\n\nGiven that we know Alex might not have finished the race, it follows that we cannot assume Alex must have finished the race. In other words, there is no guarantee or certainty that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that it's indeed not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
