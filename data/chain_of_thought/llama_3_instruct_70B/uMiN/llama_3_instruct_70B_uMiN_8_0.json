In other words, it is uncertain whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nIf the vampire \"must have been awake\", it means that it is necessarily true that the vampire was awake. However, our original statement suggests that there is uncertainty about the vampire's state of being awake or not.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we cannot conclude that the vampire must have been awake. In fact, the possibility that the vampire might not have been awake implies that it's possible that the vampire was not awake, which contradicts the idea that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we can infer that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
