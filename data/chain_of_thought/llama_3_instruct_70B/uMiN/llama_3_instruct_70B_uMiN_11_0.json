It does not provide any information about whether it must or must not be in the driveway, only that it might not be.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nFrom the given statement, we can conclude that there is no necessity for the newspaper to be in the driveway. If there was a necessity, then it wouldn't be possible for the newspaper to not be in the driveway. Since it might not be in the driveway, we can infer that there is no requirement or necessity for it to be there.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that it's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
