            "content": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nWe are given the statement: \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\"\n\nThis implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. In other words, it's uncertain or unknown whether the toy is in the toy box or not.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nThe phrase \"it's not the case\" is equivalent to negating the statement. So, we're asking if we can infer that \"the toy must be in the toy box\" is false.\n\nIf the toy might not be in the toy box (i.e., there's a possibility it's not), then it cannot be true that the toy must be in the toy box. The word \"must\" implies certainty or necessity, which contradicts the uncertainty expressed by \"might not\".\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the toy might not be in the toy box, then it's indeed not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
