This means that we cannot be certain that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nGiven that we already know there's a possibility Mary wasn't at the wedding (from the first statement), it follows that we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary must have been at the wedding. Therefore, it's indeed not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
