This means that we cannot be certain that Sue chose pizza.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\". This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that Sue had to choose pizza.\n\nGiven that we know Sue might not have chosen pizza, it follows that we cannot conclude that she must have chosen pizza. In other words, there is no necessity or obligation for Sue to have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that it's indeed not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
