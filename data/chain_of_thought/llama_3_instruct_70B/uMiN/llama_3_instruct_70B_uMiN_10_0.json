In other words, it's uncertain whether the dog was inside or not.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nIf the dog \"must have been\" inside, it means that it's necessarily true that the dog was inside. However, our original statement suggests that there is uncertainty about the dog's location, and it might not have been inside.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we cannot conclude that the dog must have been inside. In fact, the possibility of the dog not being inside contradicts the idea that the dog must have been inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
