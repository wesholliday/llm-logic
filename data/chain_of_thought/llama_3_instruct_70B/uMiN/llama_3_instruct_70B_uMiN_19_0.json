It does not provide any information about whether it is definitely not charging or if it could still be charging.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nIf the watch \"must\" be charging on the dresser, it means that it is necessarily true that the watch is charging on the dresser. However, our initial statement suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, which contradicts the idea that it \"must\" be charging.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
