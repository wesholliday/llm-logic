It does not provide any information about whether it is possible for the jacket to be draped over the chair or not.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nIf the jacket must be draped over the chair, it means that there is no possibility of it not being draped over the chair. However, our initial statement suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair. Therefore, we can conclude that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
