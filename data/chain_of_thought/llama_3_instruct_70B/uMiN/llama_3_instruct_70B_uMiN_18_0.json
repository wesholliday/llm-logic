It does not provide any information about whether the notebook must or must not be in the drawer, only that it might not be.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nIf the notebook must be in the drawer, it means that it is necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer. However, our initial statement suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer, which contradicts the idea that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
