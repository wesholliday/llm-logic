In other words, it's uncertain whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nIf the griffin might not have been in the forest, it means that there is a possibility of its absence. This directly contradicts the idea that the griffin \"must have been\" in the forest, which implies a certainty or necessity of its presence.\n\nTherefore, if we accept that the griffin might not have been in the forest, we can indeed infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
