This means that we cannot be certain that Jeff played basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\". This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that Jeff had to play basketball.\n\nGiven that we know Jeff might not have played basketball, it follows that we cannot conclude that Jeff must have played basketball. In other words, there is no necessity or obligation for Jeff to have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the initial statement, we can infer that it's indeed not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
