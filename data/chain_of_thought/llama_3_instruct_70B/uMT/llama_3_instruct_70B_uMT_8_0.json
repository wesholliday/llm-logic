            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n2. We also know that \"the mummy was not awake\". This means that M is false.\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of the first statement (V \u2192 M) when M is false. If V were true (i.e., the vampire was awake), then according to the conditional statement, M would also be true (i.e., the mummy would be awake). But we know that M is actually false.\n4. Therefore, for the implication \"V \u2192 M\" to hold true, V must be false. If V were true, it would imply M being true, which contradicts our knowledge that M is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
