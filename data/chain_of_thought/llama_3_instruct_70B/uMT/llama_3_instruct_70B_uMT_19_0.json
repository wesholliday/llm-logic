            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as:\nTom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\n2. We are also given the statement: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be represented as:\n\u00ac(Jen watches basketball)\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of these two statements. If Tom watched football, then according to statement 1, Jen would have watched basketball. But we know from statement 2 that Jen did not watch basketball.\n4. Therefore, if Tom had watched football, it would imply a contradiction (Jen both watching and not watching basketball). This means that the assumption \"Tom watches football\" leads to an impossible scenario.\n5. Hence, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
