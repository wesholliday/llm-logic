            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\", where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"Amy did not play tennis\". This can be represented as \"\u00acA\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. Now, we want to infer whether Jeff played basketball or not. Let's analyze the situation:\n   - If J \u2192 A is true, and \u00acA is true, then it means that the condition for A (Amy playing tennis) was not met. Since J \u2192 A implies that if Jeff played basketball, Amy would have played tennis, but Amy didn't play tennis, we can conclude that Jeff must not have played basketball.\n   - In other words, if Jeff had played basketball, Amy would have played tennis according to the first statement. But since Amy didn't play tennis, it means Jeff couldn't have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
