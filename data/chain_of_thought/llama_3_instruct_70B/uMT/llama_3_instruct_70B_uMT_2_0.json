We are given: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be represented as a conditional statement: Griffin \u2192 Unicorn (if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest).\n2. We are also given: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This means that the consequent of our conditional statement (Unicorn) is false.\n3. Now, we can apply a rule of inference called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 B and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, our conditional statement is Griffin \u2192 Unicorn, and we know that Unicorn (the consequent) is false. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can infer that Griffin (the antecedent) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
