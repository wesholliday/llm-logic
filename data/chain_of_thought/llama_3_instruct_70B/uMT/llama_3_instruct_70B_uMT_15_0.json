We know: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Sam takes a plane \u2192 Erin takes a train\".\n2. We also know: \"Erin did not take a train\". This means the conclusion of the conditional statement (Erin takes a train) is false.\n3. Since the conclusion is false, we need to examine the premise (Sam takes a plane). If the premise were true, it would imply a false conclusion, which is impossible. Therefore, the premise \"Sam takes a plane\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
