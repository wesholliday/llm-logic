            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as an implication: \"James wrote the book\" \u2192 \"The book is a mystery novel\".\n2. We are also told that \"the book is not a mystery novel\". This means we know the negation of the consequent (right-hand side) of the implication, i.e., \u00ac(\"The book is a mystery novel\").\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that \"the book was not written by James\", which is the negation of the antecedent (left-hand side) of the implication.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf \"James wrote the book\" \u2192 \"The book is a mystery novel\" and \u00ac(\"The book is a mystery novel\"), then \u00ac(\"James wrote the book\").\n\nIn other words, if James writing the book implies it's a mystery novel, but it's not a mystery novel, then James must not have written the book.\n\nAnswer: yes",
