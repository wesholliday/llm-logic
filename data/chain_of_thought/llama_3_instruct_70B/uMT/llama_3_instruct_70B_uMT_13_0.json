The truck was not blue (given premise)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. But from statement 2, we know that the truck is not blue.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for the color of the car:\n\n* If the car were indeed red, then according to statement 1, the truck would have to be blue.\n* But we know from statement 2 that the truck is not blue.\n* Therefore, it cannot be the case that the car is red (because if it were, the truck would have to be blue, which it's not).\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
