            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\".\n2. We also know that \"Sue was not at the wedding\". This means that Sue is definitely not present at the wedding.\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of the first statement. If Mary were at the wedding, then according to the conditional statement, Sue would have been at the wedding as well. But we know that Sue was not at the wedding (from step 2).\n4. This means that if Mary were at the wedding, it would lead to a contradiction (Sue being both present and absent). Therefore, we can conclude that Mary cannot be at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
