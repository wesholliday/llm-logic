We are given: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as a conditional statement: \"Alien visits Mars \u2192 Robot visits Jupiter\".\n2. We are also given: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\". This means that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false.\n3. Since the conclusion is false, we can infer that the premise must also be false (this is a basic rule of logic). In other words, if the robot didn't visit Jupiter, then it's likely that the alien didn't visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
