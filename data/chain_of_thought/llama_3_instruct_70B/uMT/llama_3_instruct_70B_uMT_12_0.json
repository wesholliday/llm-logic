We are given: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Joe \u2192 Lucy\" (read as \"if Joe, then Lucy\").\n2. We are also given: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This means \u00acLucy (not Lucy).\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation:\n   - If Joe went to the park, then according to the conditional statement, Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n   - But we know Lucy didn't go to the zoo (\u00acLucy).\n   - Therefore, it must be the case that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
