            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P means \"the doll was plastic\" and M means \"the truck was metal\".\n2. We are also given: \"The truck was not metal.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \u00ac denotes negation (not).\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation:\n   - If P \u2192 M is true, then it means that if the doll was plastic (P), we would expect the truck to be metal (M).\n   - But we know that the truck is not metal (\u00acM). This implies that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" (P) cannot be true, because if it were, the truck would have been metal.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
