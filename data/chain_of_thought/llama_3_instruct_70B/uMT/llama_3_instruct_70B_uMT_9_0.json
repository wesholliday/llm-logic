This implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is a given fact.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the conditional statement (1), Mark would have bought the blue shirt. But we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (fact 2). Therefore, it cannot be the case that Lisa bought the red shirt, because if she had, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which is not true.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
