We are given the statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as \"Ben eats pasta \u2192 Kate eats salad\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"Kate did not eat salad\". This can be represented as \"\u00ac(Kate eats salad)\".\n3. Now, let's analyze the implications of these two statements.
