(Given)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. But from statement 2, we know that the cat is not outside.\n\nThis means that the condition \"the dog is inside\" cannot be true, because it would imply that the cat is outside, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
