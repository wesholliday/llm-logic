We know that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented as \"Alex \u2192 Chris\" (if Alex, then Chris).\n2. We also know that \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This means \u00acChris (not Chris).\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer anything about Alex:\n\n3. Since \u00acChris, and we know that Alex \u2192 Chris, it means that Alex cannot be true (because if Alex were true, then Chris would have to be true, but we know Chris is not true).\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex must be false, which means Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
