We are given the statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This means that B (the banana being yellow) is false.\n3. Now, let's analyze the conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\". If B is false, then we can conclude that A must be false as well. This is because if A were true, then B would have to be true according to the conditional statement, but since B is actually false, A cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
