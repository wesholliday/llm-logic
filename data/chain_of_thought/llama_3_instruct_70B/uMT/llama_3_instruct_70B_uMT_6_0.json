This implies a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta.\n2. Bob did not choose pasta. This is a given fact.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sue had chosen pizza, then according to the conditional statement (1), Bob would have chosen pasta. But we know that Bob did not choose pasta (fact 2). Therefore, it must be the case that Sue did not choose pizza, because if she had, Bob would have chosen pasta, which is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
