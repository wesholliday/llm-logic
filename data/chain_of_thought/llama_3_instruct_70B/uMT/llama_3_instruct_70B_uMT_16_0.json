            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants were denim\".\n2. We are also given: \"The pants were not denim.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acD\", where \u00ac denotes negation (not).\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation:\n   - If C \u2192 D is true, then it means that if the shirt was cotton (C), we would expect the pants to be denim (D).\n   - However, we know that the pants are not denim (\u00acD). This implies that the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" (C) cannot be true, because if it were, the pants would have been denim.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
