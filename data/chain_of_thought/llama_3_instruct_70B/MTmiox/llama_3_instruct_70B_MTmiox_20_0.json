We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg might not have been surned\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B. It implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would necessarily be surned. This means that if the fleeg was not surned, then it cannot have been bluttered (because if it were bluttered, it would have to be surned).\n\n4. Combining our understanding of Statements A and B, we can conclude that since there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned (from Statement A), and if it wasn't surned then it couldn't have been bluttered (from Statement B), therefore...\n\nAnswer: yes",
