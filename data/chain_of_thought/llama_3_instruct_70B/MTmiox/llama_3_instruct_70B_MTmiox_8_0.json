This implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled.\n2. We are also given \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nCranked \u2192 Daggled\n\nThis means that if the sprocket was cranked, it necessarily implies that it was daggled.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that the sprocket was not daggled (from step 1). If this is the case, then the conditional statement in step 2 would imply that the sprocket was not cranked. This is because if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been daggled, but we are assuming it's not daggled.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
