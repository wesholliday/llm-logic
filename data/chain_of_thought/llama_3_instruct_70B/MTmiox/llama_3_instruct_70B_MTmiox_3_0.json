We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat might not have quanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement B, we can infer that if the splat was morphed, it would have quanked.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement A: \"The splat might not have quanked\". This implies that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank.\n\n4. If the splat did not quank (as suggested by Statement A), and we know from Statement B that if it was morphed, it would have quanked, then it's likely that the splat was not morphed.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
