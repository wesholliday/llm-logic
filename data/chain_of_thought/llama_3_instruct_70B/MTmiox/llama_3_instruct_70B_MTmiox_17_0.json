We are also given \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\". This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"If the flob was not skizzled, then it might not have movated\" (using modus tollens).\n3. Now, we combine the two statements: if the flob might not have movated (from step 1), and if it might not have movated implies that it was not skizzled (from step 2), then we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
