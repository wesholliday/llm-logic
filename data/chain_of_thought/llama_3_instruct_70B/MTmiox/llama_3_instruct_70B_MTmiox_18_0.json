We are given two statements:\n   - \"The shank might not have been nugged\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. From statement A, we know that it is possible that the shank was not nugged.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement B. It says that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. This implies that if the shank was not nugged, then it cannot be plooked (because if it were plooked, it would have to be nugged).\n\n4. Since we know from statement A that the shank might not have been nugged, we can conclude from statement B that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
