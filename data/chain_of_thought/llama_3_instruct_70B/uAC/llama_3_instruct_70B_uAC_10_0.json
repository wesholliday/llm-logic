From statement 2, we know for certain that the cat was outside.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement 1. It says if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Since we already know the cat was outside (from statement 2), this implies that it is possible the dog was inside.\n\n4. However, there could be another scenario where the cat was outside even though the dog was not inside. For example, both the dog and the cat could have been outside.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the dog was inside. There is a possibility that the dog was also outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
