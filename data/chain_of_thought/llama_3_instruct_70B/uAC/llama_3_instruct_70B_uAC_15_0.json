We are given the statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as \"S \u2192 E\", where S represents \"Sam took a plane\" and E represents \"Erin took a train\".\n2. We are also given the fact that \"Erin took a train\", which is E.\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that Sam took a plane (S) from the given information.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that S \u2192 E. This means that if S is true, then E must be true. However, it does not guarantee that S is true just because E is true. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nIn this case, we are only told that Erin took a train, but we don't have any direct evidence that Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
