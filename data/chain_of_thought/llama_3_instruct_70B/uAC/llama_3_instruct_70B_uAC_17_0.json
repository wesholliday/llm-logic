We are given the conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\".\n2. We are also given the fact: \"Kate ate salad\".\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Ben ate pasta.\n\nFrom the conditional statement (1), we know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. But the converse is not necessarily true - just because Kate ate salad, it doesn't mean Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\nThe fact that Kate ate salad (2) only confirms one direction of the implication, but it doesn't provide any information about Ben's action. We can't conclude that Ben ate pasta solely based on Kate eating salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
