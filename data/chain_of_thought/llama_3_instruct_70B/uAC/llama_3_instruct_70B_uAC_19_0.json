We are given the conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\".\n2. We are also given the fact: \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom the conditional statement (1), we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. But we already know that Jen watched basketball (fact 2). However, this does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football.\n\nThere could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football. For example, maybe Jen just likes basketball and decided to watch it regardless of what Tom did.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
