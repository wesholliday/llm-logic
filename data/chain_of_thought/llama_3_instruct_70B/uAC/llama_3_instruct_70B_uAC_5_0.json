We are given the conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\", where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n2. We are also given that \"Amy played tennis\", which means A is true.\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that Jeff played basketball (J) from the given information.\n\nFrom the conditional statement J \u2192 A, we know that if J is true, then A must be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: just because A is true, it doesn't mean J must be true. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nSince we only have the conditional statement and the fact that Amy played tennis, we cannot conclude with certainty that Jeff played basketball. Therefore...\n\nAnswer: no",
