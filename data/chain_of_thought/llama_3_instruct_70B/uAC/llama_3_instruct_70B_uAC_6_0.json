We are given the statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This implies a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta.\n2. We are also given the fact: \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nFrom step 1, we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. In step 2, we are told that Bob indeed chose pasta. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nFor example, maybe Bob just likes pasta and would have chosen it regardless of Sue's choice. We can't conclude that Sue chose pizza solely based on the fact that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
