            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Lisa buys red \u2192 Mark buys blue\".\n2. We are also given: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a fact that confirms the consequent of the conditional statement (i.e., Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n3. Since Mark bought the blue shirt, it satisfies the condition in the original statement. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n4. The original statement only guarantees that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark will buy the blue shirt. It does not provide a guarantee for the reverse implication (i.e., if Mark buys the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
