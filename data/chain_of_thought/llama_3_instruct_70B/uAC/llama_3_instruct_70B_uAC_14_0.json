From statement 1, we know that if the bear is in the cave, it implies the wolf is in the den.\n3. Statement 2 confirms that the wolf is indeed in the den.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean the bear is in the cave. There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den, unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the bear is not in the cave, but some other factor caused the wolf to enter the den. In this case, both statements 1 and 2 are true, yet the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the bear was in the cave based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
