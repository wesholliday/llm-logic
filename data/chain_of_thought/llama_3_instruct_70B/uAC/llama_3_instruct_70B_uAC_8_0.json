We are given: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n2. We are also given: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means M is true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the vampire was awake (i.e., V is true).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if V is true, then M must be true. But we already know that M is true. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that V is true. There could be other reasons why M is true.\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where the mummy is awake because of some external factor, but the vampire is still asleep. In this case, M would be true, but V would be false.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
