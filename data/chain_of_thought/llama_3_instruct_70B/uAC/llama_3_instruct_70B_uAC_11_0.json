The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be rewritten as \"Cake is chocolate \u2192 Muffins are blueberry\". This implies a conditional relationship between the two.\n2. We are also given that \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"the cake was chocolate\".\n\nFrom step 1, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. In step 2, we are told that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n\nSince the condition (muffins being blueberry) is true, and we have a conditional relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, it seems reasonable to conclude that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
