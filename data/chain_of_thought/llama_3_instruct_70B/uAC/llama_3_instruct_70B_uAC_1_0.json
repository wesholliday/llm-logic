            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\".\n2. We are also given: \"Sue was at the wedding\". This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is confirmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know Sue was at the wedding, and we have the conditional statement \"Mary \u2192 Sue\", we can try to infer something about Mary's presence.\n\nHowever, the conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be too. It does not provide any information about what happens when Sue is at the wedding but Mary might not be.\n\nIn other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, it doesn't necessarily mean Mary was also there. There could be other reasons why Sue attended the wedding that have nothing to do with Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
