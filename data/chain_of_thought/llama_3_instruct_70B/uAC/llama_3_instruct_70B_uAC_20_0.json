            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. We are also given that \"the banana was yellow\", which means B is true.\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the apple was red (i.e., A is true).\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that if A is true, then B must be true. But we don't have any information about what happens when B is true; we only know what happens when A is true.\n\nJust because B is true doesn't necessarily mean A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true, unrelated to A.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the banana was yellow simply because it's a natural property of bananas, regardless of the apple's color. In this case, B is true, but A might not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
