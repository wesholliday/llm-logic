We are given: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"James \u2192 Mystery\".\n2. We are also given: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"Mystery\".\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that \"the book was written by James\", which can be represented as \"James\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if James wrote the book, then it's a mystery novel. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the book is a mystery novel, then James wrote it. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nThe second statement only tells us that the book is indeed a mystery novel, but it doesn't provide any information about the author.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was written by James solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
