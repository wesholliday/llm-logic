We are given: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race\".\n2. We are also given: \"Chris finished the race\". This means C is true.\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that Alex finished the race (i.e., A is true).\n\nFrom step 1, we know that if A is true, then C must be true. But we already know that C is true (from step 2). However, this doesn't necessarily mean that A is true.\n\nThink of it like this: If I have a umbrella and it's raining, then the streets will be wet. We are given that the streets are wet (C), but that doesn't mean I must have an umbrella (A). There could be other reasons why the streets are wet!\n\nSo, we cannot infer with certainty that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
