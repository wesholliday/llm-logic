            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. If Mary is present, it guarantees Sue's presence.\n\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis statement tells us that Sue's presence is not guaranteed or necessary. In other words, Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (by statement 1). But we know it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (by statement 2). This means that if Mary were at the wedding, it would imply something that is not true (Sue's guaranteed presence).\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary were at the wedding, it would lead to a logical inconsistency.\n\nAnswer: yes",
