Since the conclusion \"Bob chooses pasta\" is false, and we know that Sue choosing pizza implies Bob choosing pasta (from step 1), it means that Sue choosing pizza cannot be true. If Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
