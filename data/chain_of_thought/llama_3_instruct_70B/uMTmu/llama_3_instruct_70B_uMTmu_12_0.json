The first statement says \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n2. The second statement says \"it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This means that Q is false.\n3. Since we know that Q is false, and we also know that \"If P, then Q\", we can infer that P must be false. If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first statement), but we know that Q is actually false.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
