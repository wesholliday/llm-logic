If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Alex finishing and Chris finishing. In other words, if Alex finished, it guarantees that Chris finished.\n\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\nThis statement tells us that we cannot conclude with certainty that Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (by statement 1). But we know it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (by statement 2). This means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" cannot be true, because if it were, it would imply that Chris must have finished, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
