            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nThis statement negates the conclusion of the previous conditional statement. In other words, we know that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation: if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the first statement, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt. But we know that's not the case (from the second statement). Therefore, our initial assumption - that Lisa bought the red shirt - must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
