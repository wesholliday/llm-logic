The second statement says \"it's not the case that the truck must have been blue\", which means ~Q (truck is not blue).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the car was not red (~P).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid argument form, we can conclude:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q and ~Q, then ~P\n\nIn our case:\nIf \"car is red\" \u2192 \"truck is blue\" and \"truck is not blue\", then \"car is not red\"\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
