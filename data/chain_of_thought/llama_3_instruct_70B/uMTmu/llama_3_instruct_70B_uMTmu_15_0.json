If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\nThis implies that if Sam took a plane, we can conclude that Erin took a train.\n\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\nThis means that we cannot conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for Sam:\n\nIf Sam had taken a plane, then according to statement 1, we would be able to conclude that Erin took a train. But statement 2 tells us that we can't conclude that Erin took a train. Therefore, it must be the case that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
