            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\".\n2. The second statement says \"it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\". This can be represented as \"\u00acU\", which means \"not U\" or \"U is false\".\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, i.e., \"\u00acG\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that G \u2192 U. This means that if G is true, then U must also be true.\nBut from the second statement, we know that \u00acU is true, which means U is false.\nSince U is false, and G \u2192 U, we can conclude that G cannot be true (because if G were true, it would imply U is true, but we know U is false).\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
