            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" can be represented as:\n\"If P (doll is plastic), then M (truck is metal)\"\n\nThis implies that if the doll is plastic, it necessarily means the truck is metal.\n\n2. The second statement says \"it's not the case that the truck must have been metal\", which can be represented as:\n\"Not M (truck is metal)\"\n\nThis means we know for certain that the truck was not metal.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the implications of these two statements together. If the doll were plastic (P), then according to statement 1, the truck would have to be metal (M). But we know from statement 2 that the truck is not metal (Not M).\n\n4. This creates a contradiction: if the doll were plastic, it would imply the truck is metal, but we know the truck is not metal. Therefore, our initial assumption - \"the doll was plastic\" - must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
