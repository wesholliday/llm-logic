The statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\" can be represented as:\nAlien visits Mars \u2192 Robot visits Jupiter\n2. The second statement says \"it's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\", which means:\n\u00ac(Robot visits Jupiter)\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nFrom step 1, we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. But from step 2, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the condition \"Alien visits Mars\" cannot be true, because it would imply \"Robot visits Jupiter\", which is false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n\u00ac(Alien visits Mars)\n\nAnswer: yes",
