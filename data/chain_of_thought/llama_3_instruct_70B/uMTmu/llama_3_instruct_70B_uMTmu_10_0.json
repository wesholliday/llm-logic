It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. (Given premise)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, it implies that the cat must be outside.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement 2. If it's not the case that the cat must have been outside, it means that the cat could have been either inside or outside - we can't conclude its location for sure.\n\nSince the cat's location is uncertain, and the dog being inside implies the cat being outside (from statement 1), we can infer that the dog might not be inside. If the dog were indeed inside, it would imply a certain location for the cat (outside), but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
