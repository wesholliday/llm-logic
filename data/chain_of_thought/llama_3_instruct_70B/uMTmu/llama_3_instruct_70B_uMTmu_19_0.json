We are given: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as:\nTom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\n2. We are also given: \"it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that Jen did not watch basketball.\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of step 1 in light of step 2. If Tom had watched football, then according to step 1, Jen would have watched basketball. But we know from step 2 that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, it cannot be the case that Tom watched football.\n4. Hence, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
