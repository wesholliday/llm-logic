We are given: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as a conditional statement: If C (shirt is cotton), then D (pants are denim).\n2. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This means that the conclusion of the previous conditional statement is false, i.e., ~D (pants are not necessarily denim).\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (~C).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid argument form, we can conclude:\n\nIf C \u2192 D (given)\n~D (given)\n\u2234 ~C (inferred)\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
