The first statement says \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be represented as \"Ben eats pasta \u2192 Kate eats salad\".\n2. The second statement says \"it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\". This means that Kate did not eat salad.\n3. Now, let's analyze the first statement again. If Ben eats pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. But we know that Kate did not eat salad (from step 2).\n4. Therefore, the only way to reconcile this is if Ben did not eat pasta. Because if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have eaten salad, but she didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
