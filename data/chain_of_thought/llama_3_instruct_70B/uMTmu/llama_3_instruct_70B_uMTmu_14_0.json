            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" can be represented as an implication: Bear_in_cave \u2192 Wolf_in_den\n2. The second statement says that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den, which means \u00ac(Wolf_in_den)\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave, i.e., \u00ac(Bear_in_cave)\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf Bear_in_cave \u2192 Wolf_in_den and \u00ac(Wolf_in_den), then \u00ac(Bear_in_cave)\n\nIn other words, if the presence of the bear in the cave implies the wolf's presence in the den, but the wolf was not in the den, then it must be the case that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
