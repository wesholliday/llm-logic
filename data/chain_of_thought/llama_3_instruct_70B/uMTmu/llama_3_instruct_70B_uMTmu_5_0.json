We are given: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as:\nJeff plays basketball \u2192 Amy plays tennis\n2. We are also given: \"it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\". This means that Amy did not play tennis.\n3. Now, let's analyze the first statement again: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" Since we know Amy didn't play tennis (from step 2), this implies that the condition \"Jeff plays basketball\" cannot be true. If it were true, then Amy would have played tennis, but she didn't.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
