If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nThis implies a conditional relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow.\n\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\nThis means that we know the banana wasn't necessarily yellow.\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if the apple was indeed red:\n\n* If the apple was red, then according to statement 1, the banana must have been yellow.\n* But we know from statement 2 that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n* This creates a contradiction, because if the apple was red, then the banana should be yellow (according to statement 1), but we know that's not true (according to statement 2).\n\nSince this leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that our initial assumption - \"the apple was red\" - must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
