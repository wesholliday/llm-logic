It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. (Given premise)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire is awake, it implies the mummy is also awake.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the mummy was not awake (or at least, it's not necessary for the mummy to be awake).\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (by statement 1). But we know the mummy was not awake (by statement 2). Therefore, our initial assumption - \"the vampire was awake\" - leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis means that our initial assumption must be false. Hence, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
