We are given \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint\", which can be rewritten as \"The wug did not necessarily bimm the zoint\" or \"Not (the wug must have bimmed the zoint)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\", which is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P = \"The wug was flooped\" and Q = \"The wug must have bimmed the zoint\".\n3. Since we know that Q is false (from step 1), we can use modus tollens to infer that P must also be false. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: if P \u2192 Q and not Q, then not P.\n4. Applying modus tollens, we get: If \"The wug was flooped\" (P) implies \"The wug must have bimmed the zoint\" (Q), and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
