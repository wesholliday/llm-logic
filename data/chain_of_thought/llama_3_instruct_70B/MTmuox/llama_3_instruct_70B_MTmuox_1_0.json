We are given \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled\", which can be rewritten as \"The flugel does not have to be zargled\" or \"Not (the flugel must have been zargled)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled\", which is a conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled (given).\n* But we know that the flugel does not have to be zargled (given).\n\nThis means that the condition \"the flugel was blimmed\" cannot be true, because if it were, then the flugel would have to be zargled, which contradicts our first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
