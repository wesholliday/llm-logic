We are given \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\", which can be rewritten as \"The shank does not have to be nugged\" or \"Not (the shank must have been nugged)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\". This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\", where P stands for \"the shank was plooked\" and N stands for \"the shank must have been nugged\".\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation: if P \u2192 N, and we know that Not(N), then we can conclude that Not(P). This is because if P were true, it would imply N, but we know that N is not true.\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
