We are given \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed\", which can be rewritten as \"The flug does not have to be zimmed\" or \"Not (the flug must have been zimmed)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\", which is a conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed (given).\n* But we know that the flug does not have to be zimmed (given).\n\nThis means that the condition \"the flug was blummed\" cannot be true, because if it were, then the flug would have to be zimmed, which contradicts our first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
