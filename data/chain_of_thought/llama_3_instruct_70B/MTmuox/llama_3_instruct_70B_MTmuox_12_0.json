We are given: \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\" (\u00acL, where L means \"the smip must have lupped the zoint\")\n2. We are also given: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\" (S \u2192 L, where S means \"the smip was shripped\")\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the smip was shripped (S), then according to the second statement, it must have lupped the zoint (L).\n* But we know that it's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint (\u00acL).\n* Therefore, if the smip was shripped (S), we would reach a contradiction, since S \u2192 L and \u00acL.\n* This means that our initial assumption \"the smip was shripped\" (S) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
