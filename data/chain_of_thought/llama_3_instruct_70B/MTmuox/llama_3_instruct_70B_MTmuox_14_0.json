We are given \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\", which can be rewritten as \"The clug did not have to be snugged\".\n2. We are also given \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\". This is a conditional statement, which means if the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug must have been snugged) must also be true.\n3. Now, let's consider what would happen if the clug was indeed fleeked. In that case, according to the conditional statement, the clug must have been snugged. But we know from step 1 that this is not the case - the clug did not have to be snugged.\n4. Therefore, our assumption in step 3 (the clug was fleeked) leads to a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption must be false, and the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
