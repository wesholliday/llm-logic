We are given \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished\", which can be rewritten as \"The twonk does not necessarily have to be varnished\" or \"The twonk might not have been varnished\".\n2. We are also given \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished\". This is a conditional statement that implies if the twonk was plinked, then varnishing is a necessary consequence.\n\nNow, let's analyze these two statements together:\n\n* If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished (by statement 2).\n* But we know the twonk might not have been varnished (by statement 1).\n\nThe only way to reconcile these two statements is if the twonk was not plinked. If the twonk was plinked, then it would necessarily be varnished, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
