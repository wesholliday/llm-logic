We are given \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated\", which can be rewritten as \"The flob does not have to move\" or \"\u00ac(flob must have movated)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\", which can be rewritten as \"Skizzled \u2192 Movated\" or \"If Skizzled, then Must Have Movated\".\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication: If the flob was indeed skizzled (Skizzled), then according to the second statement, it must have movated (Movated). But we know from the first statement that the flob does not have to move (\u00acMovated).\n4. This creates a contradiction, as Skizzled would imply Movated, but we know \u00acMovated.\n5. To avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the assumption \"Skizzled\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
