We are given \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked\", which can be rewritten as \"The whiffle does not necessarily tinkle\" or \"Not (the whiffle must have tinked)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked\", which can be represented as \"Shanked \u2192 Must Tink\" (where \"Shanked\" means \"the whiffle was shanked\" and \"Must Tink\" means \"the whiffle must have tinked\").\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of these two statements together. If the whiffle was shanked, then according to statement 2, it must have tinked. But statement 1 says that it's not necessarily true that the whiffle must have tinked.\n4. This means that if the whiffle was shanked, we would reach a contradiction (the whiffle must have tinked, but it doesn't necessarily tinkle). Therefore, our assumption \"the whiffle was shanked\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
