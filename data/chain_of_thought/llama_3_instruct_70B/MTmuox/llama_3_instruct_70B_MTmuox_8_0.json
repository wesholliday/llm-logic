We are given \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\", which can be rewritten as \"The sprocket does not have to be daggled\" or \"Not (the sprocket must have been daggled)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\", which is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A = \"The sprocket was cranked\" and B = \"The sprocket must have been daggled\".\n3. Since we know that B (the sprocket must have been daggled) is false (from step 1), we can conclude that the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" implies that A (the sprocket was cranked) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
