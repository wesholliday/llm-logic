We are given \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled\", which can be rewritten as \"The zinger does not have to be smoogled\" or symbolically as \u00acSm (where Sm means \"the zinger must have been smoogled\").\n2. We are also given \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\", which can be rewritten as \"Frag \u2192 Sm\" (where Frag means \"the zinger was fraggled\").\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the zinger was fraggled (Frag), then according to the second statement, it must have been smoogled (Sm). But we know that's not the case (\u00acSm).\n* Therefore, if Frag were true, we would reach a contradiction.\n* Hence, Frag cannot be true. In other words, \"The zinger was not fraggled\" is the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
