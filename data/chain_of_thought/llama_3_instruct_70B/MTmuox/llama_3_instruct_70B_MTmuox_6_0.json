We are given \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\", which can be rewritten as \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" or symbolically as \u00acP (where P represents \"the grommet plopped the frink\").\n2. We are also given \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\", which can be rewritten as \"If S, then P\" or symbolically as S \u2192 P (where S represents \"the grommet was sploffed\").\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of these two statements together. If S \u2192 P and \u00acP, we can conclude that \u00acS.\n\nHere's why: if it's true that \"if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink\" (S \u2192 P), and we know that the grommet did not plop the frink (\u00acP), then it cannot be the case that the grommet was sploffed (\u00acS). If it were sploffed, it would have plopped the frink, but since it didn't, it must not have been sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
