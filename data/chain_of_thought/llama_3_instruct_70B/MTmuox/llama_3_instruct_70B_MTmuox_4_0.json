We are given \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\", which can be rewritten as \"The fribble does not necessarily crink\".\n2. We are also given \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\". This implies that if the fribble was indeed snurgled, it would have crinked.\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that the fribble was snurgled. If it was, then according to statement 2, it must have crinked. But this contradicts statement 1, which says the fribble does not necessarily crink.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"the fribble was snurgled\" leads to a contradiction. This means that the assumption must be false, and hence the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
