We are given \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\", which can be rewritten as \"The sneg did not necessarily sprot the frink\" or \"\u00ac(Sneg must have sproted the frink)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\", which can be rewritten as \"Crampled Sneg \u2192 Must have sproted Frink\".\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of the second statement. If the sneg was indeed crampled, then according to the rule, it must have sproted the frink. But we know from the first statement that the sneg did not necessarily sprot the frink.\n4. This means that if the sneg was crampled, we would have a contradiction (the sneg both must and must not have sproted the frink). Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"The sneg was crampled\" leads to an inconsistency.\n5. As a result, we can infer that the assumption \"The sneg was crampled\" is false, which means \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
