We are given \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\", which can be rewritten as \"The splat does not have to quank\" or \"\u00ac(splat must have quanked)\".\n2. We are also given \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\", which can be rewritten as \"Morphed \u2192 Quanked\" or \"If Morphed, then Quanked\".\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation: if the splat was indeed morphed, then according to the second statement, it must have quanked. But we know from the first statement that the splat does not have to quank.\n4. This means that our initial assumption - \"the splat was morphed\" - leads to a contradiction (quanking is required, but it's not the case). Therefore, we can conclude that the initial assumption must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
