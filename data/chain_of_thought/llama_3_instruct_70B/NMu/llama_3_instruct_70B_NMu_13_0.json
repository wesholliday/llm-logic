This means that there is no necessity or obligation for the toy to be in the toy box.\n2. In other words, the toy being in the toy box is not a guaranteed or required situation.\n3. From this, we can infer that it's possible for the toy to not be in the toy box, because there's no requirement for it to be there.\n4. This possibility of the toy not being in the toy box is exactly what \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" means.\n\nAnswer: yes",
