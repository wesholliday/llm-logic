            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\". This means that we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the alien visited Mars.\n2. However, this does not necessarily imply that the alien did not visit Mars. It only means that we lack conclusive evidence or a logical necessity for the alien to have visited Mars.\n3. The inference \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" suggests that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n4. Given that we cannot conclude with certainty that the alien visited Mars, it is indeed possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
