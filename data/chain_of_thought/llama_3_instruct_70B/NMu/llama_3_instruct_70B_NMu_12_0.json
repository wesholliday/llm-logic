This means that there is no necessity or requirement for the jacket to be draped over the chair.\n2. If there is no necessity or requirement, it doesn't mean that the jacket cannot be draped over the chair. It simply means that it's not mandatory.\n3. The absence of a requirement (must) implies the possibility of alternatives, including the jacket not being draped over the chair.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
