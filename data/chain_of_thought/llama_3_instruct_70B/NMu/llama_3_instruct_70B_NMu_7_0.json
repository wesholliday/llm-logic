There might be some doubt or uncertainty about Alex's completion of the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze what \"Alex might not have finished the race\" implies. This statement suggests that there is a possibility, no matter how small, that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nConsidering both statements, we can see that they are related but not exactly equivalent. The original statement denies absolute certainty about Alex finishing the race, while the inferred statement introduces the possibility of Alex not finishing the race.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that if \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" is true, then indeed \"Alex might not have finished the race\" could also be true. The lack of absolute certainty in the original statement opens up the possibility of Alex not finishing the race, which is exactly what the inferred statement suggests.\n\nAnswer: yes",
