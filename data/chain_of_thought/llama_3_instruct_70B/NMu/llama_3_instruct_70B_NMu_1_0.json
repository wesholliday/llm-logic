There might be some doubt or uncertainty about her attendance.\n\nNow, let's analyze what \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies. This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n\nConsidering both statements, it seems reasonable to infer that if we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary must have been at the wedding, then it's possible that she wasn't there. In other words, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that there is some degree of uncertainty or doubt about her attendance, which aligns with the idea that \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
