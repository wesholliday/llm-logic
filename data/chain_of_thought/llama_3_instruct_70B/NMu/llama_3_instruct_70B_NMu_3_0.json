This means that we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the book was written by James.\n2. Now, let's analyze what this implies about the possibility of the book being written by James. If it's not necessarily true that the book was written by James, then there is a chance that it might not have been written by him.\n3. In other words, if we can't be 100% sure that James wrote the book, then it's possible that someone else wrote it.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
