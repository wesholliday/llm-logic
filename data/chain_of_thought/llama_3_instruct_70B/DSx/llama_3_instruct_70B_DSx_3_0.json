We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The splat is not quanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked\" (using the rule of inference that \"A or B\" is equivalent to \"not A implies B\").\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that \"The splat is not quanked\". \n\n4. Using modus tollens (a rule of inference), if we know \"If the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked\" and we also know that \"The splat is not quanked\", then we can conclude that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
