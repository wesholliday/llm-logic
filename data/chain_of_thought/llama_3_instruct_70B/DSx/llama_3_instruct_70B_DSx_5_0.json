We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The zinger is not smoogled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled\" (using the rule of inference \"p or q\" is equivalent to \"if not p, then q\").\n\n3. Now, we have Statement B, which tells us that \"The zinger is not smoogled\".\n\n4. Combining Statement B with our rewritten Statement A, we can conclude that: \"If the zinger is not smoogled (which it's not), then it must be fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
