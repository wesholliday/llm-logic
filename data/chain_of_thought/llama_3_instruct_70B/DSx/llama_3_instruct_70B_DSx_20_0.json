We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The fleeg is not surned\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"The fleeg is bluttered OR the fleeg is surned\". This is a logical OR operation, meaning that if either of the conditions is true, the entire statement is true.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The fleeg is not surned\". This means that the condition \"the fleeg is surned\" is false.\n\n4. Going back to Statement A, we know that it's an OR operation. Since one of the conditions (\"the fleeg is surned\") is false (from Statement B), the only way for Statement A to be true is if the other condition (\"The fleeg is bluttered\") is true.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
