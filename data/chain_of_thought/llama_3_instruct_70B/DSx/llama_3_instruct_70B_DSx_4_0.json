We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The fribble is not crinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked\" (using the rule of inference that \"P or Q\" is equivalent to \"not P implies Q\").\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that the fribble is not crinked.\n\n4. Using modus tollens (a rule of inference), if we know \"If the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked\" and \"The fribble is not crinked\", we can conclude that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
