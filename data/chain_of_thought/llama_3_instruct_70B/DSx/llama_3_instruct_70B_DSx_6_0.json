We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The grommet is not plopped\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there are only two possible states for the grommet: it's either sploffed or plopped.\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement B, which tells us that the grommet is not plopped. This means that the \"plopped\" state can be eliminated as a possibility.\n\n4. Since there are only two possible states (sploffed or plopped), and we've eliminated the \"plopped\" state, we are left with only one option: the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
