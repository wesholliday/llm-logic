The glip is not tragged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: the glip is either slogged or tragged.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2, which tells us that the glip is not tragged. This means that the possibility of the glip being tragged can be eliminated.\n\nSince the glip is either slogged or tragged (from statement 1), and it's not tragged (from statement 2), we are left with only one possibility: the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
