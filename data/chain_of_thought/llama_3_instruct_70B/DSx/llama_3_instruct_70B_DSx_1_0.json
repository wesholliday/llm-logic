We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The flugel is not zargled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we have Statement B, which tells us that the flugel is not zargled.\n\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, if the flugel is not zargled, and according to Statement A, it must be zargled if it's not blimmed, then it means the flugel cannot be \"not blimmed\". Therefore, it must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
