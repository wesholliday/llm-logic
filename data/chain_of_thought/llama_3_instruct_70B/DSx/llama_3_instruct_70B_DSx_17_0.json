The flob is not movated.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the flob is skizzled or it is movated. This is an \"either-or\" situation, where one of the options must be true.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2, which tells us that the flob is not movated. This means that the second option (the flob being movated) is eliminated, leaving only one possibility: the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
