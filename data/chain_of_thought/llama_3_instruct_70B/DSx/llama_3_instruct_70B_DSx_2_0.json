The wug is not bimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2, which tells us that the wug is not bimmed. This means that one of the two possibilities mentioned in statement 1 is eliminated.\n\nSince the wug is not bimmed, and there are only two possibilities (either flooped or bimmed), we can conclude that the other possibility must be true: the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
