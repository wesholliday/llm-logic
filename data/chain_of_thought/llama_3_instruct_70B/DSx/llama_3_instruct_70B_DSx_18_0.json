We are given two statements: \n   - \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The shank is not nugged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged\" (using the rule of inference that \"P or Q\" is equivalent to \"not P implies Q\").\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that \"The shank is not nugged\". \n\n4. Combining this with our rewritten Statement A, we can conclude that the shank must be plooked (because if it were not plooked, then it would have to be nugged, but we know it's not nugged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
