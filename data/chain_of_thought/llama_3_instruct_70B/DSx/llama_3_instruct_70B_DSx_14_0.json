The clug is not snugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged. \n\nNow, let's consider statement 2, which tells us that the clug is not snugged. This means that one of the two possibilities mentioned in statement 1 is eliminated.\n\nSince the clug is not snugged, and there are only two possibilities (either fleeked or snugged), we can conclude that the remaining possibility must be true: the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
