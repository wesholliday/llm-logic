The wug is not garpled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2, which tells us that the wug is not garpled. This means that the second possibility (the wug being garpled) can be eliminated.\n\nSince the wug is not garpled, and there are only two possibilities according to statement 1, we are left with only one option: the wug must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
