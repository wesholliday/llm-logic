We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The flug is not zimmed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - The flug is blummed\n   - The flug is zimmed\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement B, which tells us that the flug is not zimmed. This means we can eliminate the second possibility from Step 2.\n\n4. Since the flug is not zimmed (Statement B), and there are only two possibilities according to Statement A, we are left with only one option: \n   - The flug is blummed\n\nAnswer: yes",
