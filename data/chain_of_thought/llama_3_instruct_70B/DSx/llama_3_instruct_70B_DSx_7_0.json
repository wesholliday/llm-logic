We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The whiffle is not tinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\" This is because \"either...or\" implies that if one option is not true, the other must be.\n\n3. Now, we are told in Statement B that \"The whiffle is not tinked\". \n\n4. Combining this information with our rewritten Statement A, we can conclude that since the whiffle is not tinked, it must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
