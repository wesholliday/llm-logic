We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The smonk is not plagged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - The smonk is vreebled\n   - The smonk is plagged\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement B, which tells us that the smonk is NOT plagged.\n\n4. Since the smonk is not plagged (from Statement B), and there are only two possibilities according to Statement A, we can conclude that:\n   - The smonk must be vreebled\n\nAnswer: yes",
