This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nThis type of inference is known as modus tollens. It states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), then we can conclude that P must also be false (not P).\n\nIn our case, the original statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" implies that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
