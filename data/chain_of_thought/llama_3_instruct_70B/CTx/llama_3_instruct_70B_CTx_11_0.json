In other words, if the flug is blummed, it necessarily means it is also zimmed.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\"\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider the opposite of being zimmed, i.e., not being zimmed. If the flug is not zimmed, it means that the condition for being zimmed (being blummed) is not satisfied.\n\nSince being blummed implies being zimmed, if the flug is not zimmed, it's likely that it's also not blummed. This is because if it were blummed, it would necessarily be zimmed, but we know it's not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
