This means that fraggling necessarily leads to smoogling.\n\nNow, consider the negation of smoogling (\u00acSmoogle). If the zinger is not smoogled, then it cannot have been fraggled, because fraggling would have led to smoogling. Therefore, if the zinger is not smoogled, it must not be fraggled.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the inference is valid:\n\nAnswer: yes",
