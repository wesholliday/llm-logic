If P \u2192 V is true, it means that whenever the twonk is plinked (P), it must be varnished (V). This implies that if the twonk is not varnished (\u00acV), it cannot have been plinked (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
