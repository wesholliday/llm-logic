            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\"\n\nThis implies that if plooked is true, then nugged must also be true. In other words, plooked \u2192 nugged.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\"\n\nThis statement can be rewritten as: \"If not nugged, then not plooked\", or in symbolic form: \u00acnugged \u2192 \u00acplooked\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's analyze the given implication:\n\nplooked \u2192 nugged\n\nWe can apply a logical rule called contraposition, which states that if A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nIn our case, A = plooked and B = nugged. Applying contraposition, we get:\n\n\u00acnugged \u2192 \u00acplooked\n\nThis is exactly the statement we wanted to infer! Therefore, yes, we can indeed infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the original implication.\n\nAnswer: yes",
