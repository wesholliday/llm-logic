This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called contraposition. It states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nSo, in our case, since we have \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\", we can indeed infer \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
