The contrapositive of p \u2192 q is \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp.\n\nThe key insight here is that if p \u2192 q is true, then its contrapositive \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp must also be true. This is because if it's impossible for p to be true without q being true (which is what p \u2192 q says), then it's also impossible for q to be false without p being false.\n\nSo, in this case, since we are given that \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is true, we can indeed infer that \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
