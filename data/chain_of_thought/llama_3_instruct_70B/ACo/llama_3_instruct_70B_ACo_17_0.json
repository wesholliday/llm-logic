From the second statement, we know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n3. The first statement tells us that Kate indeed ate salad.\n\nNow, here's where things get tricky:\n\n4. We might be tempted to conclude that since Kate ate salad and the only way Kate could eat salad is if Ben ate pasta (according to the second statement), therefore Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, unrelated to Ben eating pasta. The second statement only guarantees that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad; it does not guarantee the reverse - that if Kate ate salad, then Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nSo, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Ben ate pasta' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
