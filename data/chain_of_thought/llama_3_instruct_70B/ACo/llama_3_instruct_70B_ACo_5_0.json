From the first statement, we know that Amy played tennis.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as 'Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis'.\n\n4. Since we know that Amy played tennis (from step 2), the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n5. However, this does not necessarily mean that the antecedent ('Jeff played basketball') is also true. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Jeff played basketball'.\n\nAnswer: no",
