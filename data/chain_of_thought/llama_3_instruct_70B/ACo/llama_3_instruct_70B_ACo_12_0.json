We are given two statements:\n   - \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy went to the zoo\". This means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\n3. We know from Statement A that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is indeed true.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that \"Joe went to the park\" is true. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe going to the park.\n\n5. Since we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Joe went to the park\" is true based on the given information, our answer should be:\n\nAnswer: no",
