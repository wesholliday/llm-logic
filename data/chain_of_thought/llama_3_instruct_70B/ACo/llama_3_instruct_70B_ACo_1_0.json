If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. It only establishes a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding. But this information alone does not provide any conclusive evidence about Mary's presence.\n\nSince we cannot logically deduce Mary's presence from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
