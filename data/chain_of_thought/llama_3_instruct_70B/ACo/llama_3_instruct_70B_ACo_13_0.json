We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck was blue\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\".\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that the truck was indeed blue.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition \"the car was red\" (P) is true. There could be other reasons why the truck was blue.\n\n5. Since Statement B only guarantees that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue, but it does not provide any information about the car's color when the truck is blue, we cannot infer that \"the car was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
