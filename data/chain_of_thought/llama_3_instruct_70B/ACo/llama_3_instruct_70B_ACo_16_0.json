If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. But we already know from statement 1 that the pants are indeed denim.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt is cotton. There could be other reasons why the pants are denim, unrelated to the shirt being cotton.\n\nFor example, maybe the pants were denim simply because they were made of denim material, regardless of what the shirt was made of.\n\nSo, we cannot infer with certainty that the shirt was cotton based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
