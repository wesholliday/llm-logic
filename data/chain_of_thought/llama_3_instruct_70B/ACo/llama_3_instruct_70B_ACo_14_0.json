We are given two statements:\n   - \"The wolf was in the den\" (P)\n   - \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (Q \u2192 P)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that if Q (the bear was in the cave) is true, then P (the wolf was in the den) must also be true.\n\n3. However, just because P is true, it does not necessarily mean that Q is true. There could be other reasons why the wolf was in the den.\n\n4. Since we cannot conclude that Q is true solely based on P being true, we cannot infer \"The bear was in the cave\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
