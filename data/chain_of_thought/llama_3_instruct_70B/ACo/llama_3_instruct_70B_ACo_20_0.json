            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The banana was yellow\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that Q (\"the banana was yellow\") is true.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily imply that P (\"the apple was red\") is true. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow.\n\n5. The conditional statement (Statement B) only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when Q is true but P is false or unknown.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The apple was red\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
