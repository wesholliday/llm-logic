            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The mummy was awake\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as an implication: \n   Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\n4. Now, let's analyze the implication in Statement B. If the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, it does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must be awake too. This is a classic case of a one-way implication.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The vampire was awake\".\n\nAnswer: no",
