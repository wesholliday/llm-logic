We are also given that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This can be rewritten as \"James wrote the book \u2192 The book is a mystery novel\".\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The book was written by James\" from these two statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the book is indeed a mystery novel. But this doesn't necessarily mean it was written by James. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels as well.\n\nThe conditional statement in step 2 only guarantees that if James wrote the book, then it's a mystery novel. It doesn't provide any information about whether James actually wrote the book or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The book was written by James\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
