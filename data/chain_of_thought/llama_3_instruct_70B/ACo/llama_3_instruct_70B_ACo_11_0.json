If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. But this implication only works one way: it doesn't necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n\nIn other words, statement 2 can be rewritten as:\n\n\"If cake is chocolate \u2192 muffins are blueberry\"\n\nThis does not imply:\n\n\"muffins are blueberry \u2192 cake is chocolate\"\n\nWe only know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins will be blueberry. But we don't have any information about what happens when the muffins are blueberry.\n\nSo, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The cake was chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: no",
