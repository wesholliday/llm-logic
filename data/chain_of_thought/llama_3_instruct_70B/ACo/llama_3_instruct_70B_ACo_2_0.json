If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, it implies that the unicorn was in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nWe already know from statement 1 that the unicorn was in the forest, but this could be due to other reasons unrelated to the griffin's presence. There is no direct connection between the griffin's presence and the unicorn's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The griffin was in the forest' solely based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
