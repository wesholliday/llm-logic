From the second statement, we know that if Sue chose pizza (SCP), then Bob must have chosen pasta (BP). This implies a conditional relationship between SCP and BP.\n\n3. Now, we are given that Bob indeed chose pasta (BP).\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza (SCP). There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\n5. The conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" only guarantees BP if SCP is true, but it does not guarantee SCP if BP is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
