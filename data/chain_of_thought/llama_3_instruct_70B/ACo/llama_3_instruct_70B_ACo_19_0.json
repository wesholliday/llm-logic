From the second statement, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n3. Now, we are told that 'Jen watched basketball'. This means the consequence of the conditional statement (if Tom watched football, then...) has occurred.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition (Tom watched football) is true. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Tom watched football'.\n\nAnswer: no",
