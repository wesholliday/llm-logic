We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck was metal\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that Q (\"the truck was metal\") is true.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily imply that P (\"the doll was plastic\") is true. There could be other reasons why the truck was metal, unrelated to the doll being plastic.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: no",
