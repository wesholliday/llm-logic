If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race.\n\nThe fact that Chris finished the race (statement 1) does not provide any direct evidence about whether Alex finished the race or not. It only tells us that Chris finished the race, which is consistent with statement 2, but it doesn't imply that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex finishes the race based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
