We are given two statements:\n   - \"The robot visited Jupiter\" (R)\n   - \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (A \u2192 R)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that if A (the alien visited Mars) is true, then R (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether A is actually true or false. All we know is that R is true.\n\n4. Since R being true does not necessarily imply A being true (there could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter), we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars solely based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
