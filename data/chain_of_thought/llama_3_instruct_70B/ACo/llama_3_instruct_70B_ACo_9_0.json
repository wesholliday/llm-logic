We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (M)\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (L \u2192 M)\n\n2. From statement 2, we can see that if Lisa bought the red shirt (L), it implies Mark bought the blue shirt (M). However, this implication does not work in reverse; just because Mark bought the blue shirt (M) doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt (L).\n\n3. The first statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" only confirms that M is true but provides no information about L.\n\n4. Since we cannot logically deduce L from the given statements, we cannot infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no",
