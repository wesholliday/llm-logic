We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" (\u00acQ)\n   - \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" (M \u2228 Q)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the splat does not necessarily need to be quanked.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement:\n   - It says that either the splat is morphed (M) or it must be quanked (Q).\n   - Since we already know from the first statement that Q is not true (\u00acQ), the only possibility left is M.\n   - Therefore, if the second statement is true, then M must be true.\n\n4. So, combining both statements, we can conclude that \"The splat is morphed\" (M) is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
