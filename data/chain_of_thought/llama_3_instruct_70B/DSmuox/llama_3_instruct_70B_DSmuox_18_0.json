            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" (i.e., \u00ac(must be nugged))\n   - \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" (i.e., plooked \u2228 must be nugged)\n\n2. We can rewrite the second statement using a logical equivalence: \n   \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" \u2261 \"If it's not the case that the shank is plooked, then it must be nugged\" (i.e., \u00acplooked \u2192 must be nugged)\n\n3. Now we have two statements:\n   - \u00ac(must be nugged)\n   - \u00acplooked \u2192 must be nugged\n\n4. We can apply modus tollens to these two statements:\n   If \u00ac(must be nugged) is true, and \u00acplooked \u2192 must be nugged is also true, then we can infer \u00ac\u00acplooked (i.e., plooked)\n\nAnswer: yes",
