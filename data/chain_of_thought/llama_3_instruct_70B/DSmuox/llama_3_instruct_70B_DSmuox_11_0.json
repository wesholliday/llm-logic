We have two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" (\u00aczimmed)\n   - \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" (blummed \u2228 zimmed)\n\n2. From the second premise, we know that either blummed is true or zimmed is true (or both).\n\n3. But from the first premise, we know that zimmed is not true (\u00aczimmed).\n\n4. So, since zimmed is not true and either blummed or zimmed must be true, it means that blummed must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
