We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled\" (i.e., \u00ac(must be smoogled))\n   - \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" (i.e., fraggled \u2228 must be smoogled)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that either one of the conditions (fraggled or must be smoogled) must be true.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled\" (\u00ac(must be smoogled)). This means that the condition \"must be smoogled\" is false.\n\n4. Since one of the conditions in the second statement must be true, and we know that \"must be smoogled\" is false, it implies that the other condition \"fraggled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
