We have two premises:\n   - It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked (\u00ac\u2200x(Tx))\n   - Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked (\u2203x(Sx) \u2228 \u2200x(Tx))\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that it's not necessary for the whiffle to be tinked.\n3. The second premise presents an either-or situation: either the whiffle is shanked (\u2203x(Sx)) or it must be tinked (\u2200x(Tx)).\n4. Since we know from the first premise that it's not necessary for the whiffle to be tinked (\u00ac\u2200x(Tx)), the only remaining option in the second premise is that the whiffle is shanked (\u2203x(Sx)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
