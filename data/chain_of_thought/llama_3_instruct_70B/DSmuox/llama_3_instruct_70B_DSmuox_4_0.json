            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\" (\u00acMC, where M means \"must be\" and C means \"crinked\")\n   - \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" (S \u2228 MC, where S means \"snurgled\")\n\n2. We can rewrite the second premise using material implication:\n   - \"If the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked\" (\u223cS \u2192 MC)\n\n3. Now, we have \u00acMC from the first premise. Using modus tollens with the rewritten second premise, we get:\n   - \u223cS \u2192 MC\n   - \u00acMC\n   - \u2234 \u223c\u223cS (or simply S)\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\" (S).\n\nAnswer: yes",
