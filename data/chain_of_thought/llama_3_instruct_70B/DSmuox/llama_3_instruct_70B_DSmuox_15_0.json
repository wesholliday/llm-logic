            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" (i.e., \u00ac(must be spened))\n   - \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\" (i.e., vroombed \u2228 must be spened)\n\n2. We can rewrite the second statement using a logical equivalence: p \u2228 q \u2261 \u00acp \u2192 q\n   So, \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\" becomes \"If the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened\" (i.e., \u00acvroombed \u2192 must be spened)\n\n3. Now we have two statements:\n   - \u00ac(must be spened)\n   - \u00acvroombed \u2192 must be spened\n\n4. We can apply modus tollens to these two statements:\n   If \u00ac(must be spened) is true, and \u00acvroombed \u2192 must be spened is also true, then we can conclude that \u00ac\u00acvroombed (i.e., vroombed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
