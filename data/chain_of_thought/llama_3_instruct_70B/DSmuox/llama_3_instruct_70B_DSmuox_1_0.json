We have two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" (\u00acZ, where Z means \"the flugel must be zargled\")\n   - \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" (B \u2228 Z, where B means \"the flugel is blimmed\")\n\n2. From the second premise, we know that either B is true or Z is true (or both).\n\n3. However, the first premise tells us that Z is not true (\u00acZ). \n\n4. Therefore, since Z is not true and either B or Z must be true, it means that B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
