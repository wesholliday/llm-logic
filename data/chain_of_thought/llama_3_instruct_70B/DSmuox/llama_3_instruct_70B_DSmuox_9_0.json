We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\" (which can be rewritten as \"The twonk does not have to be plinked\")\n   - \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that one of two options must be true: either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\n\n3. However, the first statement tells us that the twonk does not have to be plinked. This means the \"it must be plinked\" option from the second statement cannot be true.\n\n4. Since one of the two options in the second statement must be true (either varnished or plinked), and we know it's not plinked, then the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
