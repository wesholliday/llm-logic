We have two statements:\n   - \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which implies that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\n3. From statement A, we know that the possibility of the missing sock not being under the bed exists.\n\n4. Now, let's apply this to statement B: If the missing sock might not be under the bed (as stated in A), then according to the \"either-or\" logic in B, it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
