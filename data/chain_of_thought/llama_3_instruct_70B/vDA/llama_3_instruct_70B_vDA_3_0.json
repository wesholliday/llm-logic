            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The book was not written by James.\" This tells us that James did not write the book.\n\n3. Now, let's examine the conclusion: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. But the second premise tells us that James didn't write the book. This means we can't conclude anything about the book being a mystery novel or not based on the information provided.\n\nIn other words, just because James didn't write the book, it doesn't necessarily mean the book is not a mystery novel. It could have been written by someone else who wrote a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
