            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This implies that if Mary attended the wedding, it would necessarily mean that Sue also attended.\n2. The second premise states: \"Mary was not at the wedding\". This tells us that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n3. Now, let's consider what we can infer from these two premises. Since Mary didn't attend the wedding (premise 2), and if Mary had attended, Sue would have also attended (premise 1), it logically follows that Sue might or might not have attended the wedding. We cannot conclude with certainty that Sue did not attend.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument states: \"Sue was not at the wedding\". This conclusion is not necessarily true based on the given premises. It's possible that Sue attended the wedding even though Mary didn't.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because it makes an unjustified leap from the premises to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
