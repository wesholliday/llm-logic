            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P = \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q = \"Kate ate salad\".\n2. The second premise is \"Ben did not eat pasta\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\" (not P).\n3. The conclusion is \"Kate did not eat salad\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (Q). But from the second premise, we know that Ben did not eat pasta (\u00acP).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since P \u2192 Q and \u00acP, it must be the case that \u00acQ. In other words, if Ben didn't eat pasta, then Kate didn't eat salad.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
