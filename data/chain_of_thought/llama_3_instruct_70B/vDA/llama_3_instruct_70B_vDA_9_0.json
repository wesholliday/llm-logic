            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n2. The second premise states: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". This can be represented as \"\u00acP\", which means \"not P\" or \"it's not the case that Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n3. The conclusion states: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". This can be represented as \"\u00acQ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true (P \u2192 Q).\nFrom premise 2, we know that P is false (\u00acP).\nSince P is false, the conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" does not imply anything about Q. In other words, we cannot conclude whether Q is true or false based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \u00acQ is trying to assert that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. But we haven't found any logical connection between the premises and this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is NOT logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
