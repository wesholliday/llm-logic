            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"Tom did not watch football\" (\u223cp)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jen did not watch basketball\" (\u223cq)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Tom watched football (p), then Jen watched basketball (q). However, premise 2 tells us that Tom did not watch football (\u223cp).\n\nSince Tom didn't watch football, the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" doesn't provide any information about whether Jen watched basketball or not. The conclusion \"Jen did not watch basketball\" (\u223cq) is not necessarily true based on the premises.\n\nIn fact, we can imagine a scenario where Tom didn't watch football, but Jen still watched basketball. This would satisfy both premises, but contradict the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
