            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This implies that if the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise is \"The apple was not red\". This means that the condition \"the apple was red\" is actually false.\n3. Now, let's examine what happens to the conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\". If the condition \"the apple was red\" is false, then the implication in the first premise doesn't apply. In other words, we can't conclude anything about the banana's color based on the apple's color.\n\nHowever, just because the apple wasn't red, it doesn't necessarily mean that the banana wasn't yellow. There could be other reasons why the banana was or wasn't yellow, unrelated to the apple's color.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\" doesn't logically follow from the premises. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
