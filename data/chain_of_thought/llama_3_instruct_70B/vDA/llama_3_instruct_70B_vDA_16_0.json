            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants were denim\".\n2. The second premise is \"The shirt was not cotton\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The pants were not denim\", which can be represented as \"\u00acD\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if C is true, then D must also be true (C \u2192 D).\nHowever, the second premise tells us that C is actually false (\u00acC).\nSince C is false, the conditional statement \"If C, then D\" does not provide any information about D. In other words, we cannot conclude anything about D based on the first premise alone.\n\nThe conclusion \"\u00acD\" is trying to infer something about D, but there is no logical connection between the premises and the conclusion. The argument is essentially saying that because the shirt was not cotton, the pants must not be denim, which does not logically follow.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is NOT logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
