            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Z\", where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Z represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. The second premise states: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP\", which means \"not P\" or \"it is not the case that Joe went to the park\".\n3. The conclusion states: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acZ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (Joe went to the park), then Z (Lucy went to the zoo). However, premise 2 tells us that \u00acP (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can infer that since P \u2192 Z and \u00acP, it must be the case that \u00acZ. This is because if Joe didn't go to the park (\u00acP), then the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" doesn't apply, and we can conclude that Lucy didn't go to the zoo (\u00acZ).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
