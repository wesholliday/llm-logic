            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\".\n2. The second premise is \"The doll was not plastic\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\" (not P).\n3. The conclusion is \"The truck was not metal\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if P is true, then M must also be true (P \u2192 M). However, the second premise tells us that P is actually false (\u00acP).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can conclude that since P is false and P \u2192 M, M cannot be true. In other words, \u00acM.\n\nSo, the conclusion \"The truck was not metal\" (\u00acM) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
