    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. The trundle is likely to be #1 in sales.\n2. The foopet is closely behind the trundle in expected sales.\n3. The crangor has significantly lower expected sales than the top two.\n4. If the foopet isn't the top seller, then if the trundle isn't, the crangor will be. This implies that if the trundle isn't #1, the foopet must be #1, otherwise, the crangor would be #1.\n5. The trundle likely will lead sales, which means it's probable that the trundle will be #1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?\"\n\nFrom point 4, we know that if the trundle isn't #1, then the foopet must be #1. This means that the probability of the crangor being #1 when the trundle isn't is low, since the foopet is more likely to take the top spot.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be.\n\nAnswer: no",
