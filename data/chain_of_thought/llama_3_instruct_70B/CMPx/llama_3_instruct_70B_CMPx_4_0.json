    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. The crinel is the frontrunner for snarggle.\n2. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n3. The crinel likely will be named snarggle.\n4. Hence, the nafiz likely won't be.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that it's likely that the crinel will be named snarggle. If this happens, then the condition \"if the crinel isn't named snarggle\" in point 2 is not satisfied, and we can't conclude anything about the tomul being named snarggle.\n\nHowever, if the crinel isn't named snarggle (which is unlikely, but possible), then according to point 2, if the nafiz isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be. Since it's likely that the nafiz won't be named snarggle (point 4), we can conclude that in this scenario, it's likely that the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nSo, to answer the question: does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be? \n\nAnswer: yes",
