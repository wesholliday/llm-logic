    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

The votal trails far behind.\n4. If the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that the fraglen is likely to lead the league.\n\nFrom point 4, we can infer that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, then the darpil might. But since the darpil is expected to be second-best (point 2), it's unlikely that the darpil will lead the league if the fraglen doesn't.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the fraglen doesn't lead the league. In this case, we know that the darpil might lead the league, but it's unlikely due to point 2. Therefore, it's possible that the votal could lead the league in this scenario.\n\nHowever, we can't conclude that it's likely that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen doesn't. The information only suggests that the votal might have a chance, but it's still trailing far behind (point 3).\n\nAnswer: no",
