Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. The garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet.\n2. The peedonk has a much lower chance of winning.\n3. If the beelhet doesn't become domer, then if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer.\n4. It is likely that the garplex will become domer.\n\nFrom point 4, we know that the probability of the garplex becoming domer is high. If the garplex becomes domer, then the question of what happens if it doesn't become domer is moot.\n\nHowever, let's consider the case where the garplex doesn't become domer. In this scenario, we know from point 3 that if the beelhet also doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer.\n\nBut here's the key insight: just because it's likely that the garplex will become domer (point 4), it doesn't mean that if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk is likely to win. In fact, we know from point 1 that the beelhet is a close second in terms of likelihood of winning, so if the garplex doesn't become domer, it's more likely that the beelhet will win instead.\n\nTherefore, even though it's likely that the garplex will become domer, it's not necessarily likely that if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will. The beelhet is still a strong contender in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
