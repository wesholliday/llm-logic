    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. The jantiz is the most qualified applicant.\n2. The cramen is the second-most qualified applicant.\n3. The sulect has weaker qualifications than both the jantiz and the cramen.\n4. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't, the sulect will.\n\nFrom point 1, we can infer that it's likely the jantiz will get the zulision. This means it's unlikely the jantiz won't get the zulision.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the jantiz doesn't get the zulision. In this case, the cramen is the next most qualified applicant. It's likely that the cramen will get the zulision instead of the sulect, since the cramen has stronger qualifications than the sulect.\n\nHowever, point 4 tells us that if the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then the sulect will. But we just concluded that it's likely the cramen will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't. Therefore, it's unlikely that the cramen won't get the zulision, which means it's unlikely that the sulect will.\n\nAnswer: no",
