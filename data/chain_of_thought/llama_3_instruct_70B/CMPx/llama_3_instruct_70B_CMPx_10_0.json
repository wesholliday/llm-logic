    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. The fantole is expected to retain the top spot in downloads.\n2. The dribban is expected to be second in downloads.\n3. The cruggit has a significantly lower download rate than the other two.\n4. If the dribban isn't the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn't, the cruggit will be. (This implies that if the dribban isn't first, it must be because the fantole is, and if the fantole isn't first, then the cruggit must be.)\n5. The fantole likely will lead downloads, hence the dribban likely won't.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that it's likely that the fantole will be the most downloaded. If this is the case, then the dribban won't be the most downloaded (by point 5). Now, let's consider what happens if the fantole isn't the most downloaded. By point 4, if the dribban isn't the most downloaded (which we know is likely), then the cruggit will be.\n\nSo, yes, it does follow that it's likely that, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
