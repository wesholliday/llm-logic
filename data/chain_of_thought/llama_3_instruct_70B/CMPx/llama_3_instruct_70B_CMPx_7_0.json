    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. The crastin is expected to birth the most offspring.\n2. The nivet is expected to birth fewer offspring than the crastin but more than the jomial.\n3. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will. This implies that if the crastin and nivet both don't birth the most offspring, the jomial must.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will?\n\nFrom point 3, we know that if the crastin doesn't birth the most offspring, then either the nivet or the jomial must. However, we also know from point 2 that the nivet is expected to birth more offspring than the jomial. Therefore, it's more likely that the nivet will birth the most offspring if the crastin doesn't, rather than the jomial.\n\nSo, while it's possible that the jomial might birth the most offspring if the crastin doesn't, it's not necessarily likely. The likelihood of the jomial birthing the most offspring in this scenario is lower than that of the nivet.\n\nAnswer: no",
