We have a conditional statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This implies that if the condition \"the flug was blummed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n2. We are given the premise: \"The flug was blummed.\" This means the condition in step 1 is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement from step 1. Therefore, we can conclude that \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
