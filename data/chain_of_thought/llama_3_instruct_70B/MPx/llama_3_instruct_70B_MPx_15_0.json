This implies that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n2. We are given that \"The dreb was vroombed\" is true. This means the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true and the conditional statement implies a connection between the condition and the conclusion, we can infer that the conclusion \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
