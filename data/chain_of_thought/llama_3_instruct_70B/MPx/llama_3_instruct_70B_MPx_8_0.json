            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and D is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The sprocket was cranked\", which is the antecedent (C) of our conditional statement.\n3. In a conditional statement, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n4. Therefore, since we know C is true, and C \u2192 D, we can infer that D is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
