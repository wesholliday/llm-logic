We have a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the flob was skizzled\" and B is \"the flob movated\".\n2. We are also given that \"The flob was skizzled\", which corresponds to A being true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The flob movated\" (B) from the given information.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a fundamental rule of inference in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf A \u2192 B (given)\nA (given)\n\u2234 B (inferred)\n\nIn this case, since A (\"the flob was skizzled\") is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If A then B\", we can infer that B (\"the flob movated\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
