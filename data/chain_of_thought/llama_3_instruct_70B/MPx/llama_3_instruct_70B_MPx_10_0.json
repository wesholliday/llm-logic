            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled\".\n2. We are also given that \"The wug was sproinged\", which is the antecedent (P) of our conditional statement.\n3. In logic, if we have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nWe have \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (P \u2192 Q), and we know that \"The wug was sproinged\" (P). Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that \"It was garpled\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
