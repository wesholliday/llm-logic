We have a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This implies that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the consequence \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n2. We are given that \"The splat was morphed\" is true.\n3. Since the condition in step 1 is satisfied (the splat was indeed morphed), we can conclude that the consequence \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
