We have a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This implies that if the condition \"the smonk was vreebled\" is true, then the consequence \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n2. We are given that \"The smonk was vreebled\" is true.\n3. Since the condition in step 1 is satisfied (the smonk was indeed vreebled), we can conclude that the consequence must also be true, which is \"The smonk plagged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
