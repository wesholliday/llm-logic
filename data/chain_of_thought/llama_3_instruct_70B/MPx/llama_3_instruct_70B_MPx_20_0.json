We have a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This implies that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n2. We are given that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" is true.\n3. Since the condition in step 1 is satisfied (the fleeg was indeed bluttered), we can conclude that the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
