We have a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This implies that if the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is true, then the consequence \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true.\n2. We are given that \"The sneg was crampled\" is true.\n3. Since the condition in step 1 is satisfied (the sneg was indeed crampled), we can infer that the consequence must also be true, which is \"The sneg sproted the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
