We have a conditional statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This can be represented as \"Shanked \u2192 Tinked\" (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\").\n2. We are also given that \"The whiffle was shanked\" is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle tinked\" from the above statements.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf Shanked \u2192 Tinked (given)\nShanked (given)\n\u2234 Tinked (inferred)\n\nIn other words, since the whiffle was shanked and shanking implies tinking, we can logically conclude that the whiffle tinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
