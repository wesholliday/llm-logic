We have a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This implies that if the condition \"the wug was flooped\" is true, then the consequence \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" must also be true.\n2. We are given the premise \"The wug was flooped\", which means the condition in step 1 is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can infer that the consequence \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
