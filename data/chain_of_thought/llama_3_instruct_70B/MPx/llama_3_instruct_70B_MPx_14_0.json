We have a conditional statement: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the clug was fleeked\" and B is \"the clug snugged\".\n2. We are also given that \"The clug was fleeked\", which is statement A.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The clug snugged\", which is statement B.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf A \u2192 B (given)\nA (given)\n\u2234 B (inferred)\n\nIn this case, since we have the conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" and we know that \"The clug was fleeked\", we can indeed infer that \"The clug snugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
