We have a conditional statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This implies that if the condition \"the glip was slogged\" is true, then the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n2. We are given the premise: \"The glip was slogged.\" This means the condition in step 1 is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement from step 1. Therefore, we can conclude that \"the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
