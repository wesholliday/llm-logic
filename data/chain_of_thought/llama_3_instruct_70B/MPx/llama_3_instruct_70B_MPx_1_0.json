We have a conditional statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This implies that if the condition \"the flugel was blimmed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flugel was zargled\" must also be true.\n2. We are given the premise: \"The flugel was blimmed.\" This means the condition in step 1 is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement from step 1. Therefore, we can conclude that \"the flugel was zargled\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
