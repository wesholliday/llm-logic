            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink\".\n2. We are also given that \"The grommet was sploffed\", which corresponds to statement A.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The grommet plopped the frink\", which corresponds to statement B.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf A \u2192 B (given)\nA (given)\n\u2234 B (inferred)\n\nIn this case, since we have both the conditional statement and the antecedent (A), we can infer the consequent (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
