We have a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 V\", where P means \"the twonk was plinked\" and V means \"it was varnished\".\n2. We are also given that \"The twonk was plinked\", which is the antecedent of the conditional statement (P).\n3. According to modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, if we have P \u2192 V and P, then we can infer V.\n4. Therefore, since we have both the conditional statement and the antecedent, we can conclude that \"It was varnished\" (V).\n\nAnswer: yes",
