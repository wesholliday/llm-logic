We have a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This implies that if the condition \"the shank was plooked\" is true, then the conclusion \"the shank was nugged\" must also be true.\n2. We are given that \"The shank was plooked\" is true. This means the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true and the conditional statement implies a connection between the condition and the conclusion, we can infer that the conclusion \"the shank was nugged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
