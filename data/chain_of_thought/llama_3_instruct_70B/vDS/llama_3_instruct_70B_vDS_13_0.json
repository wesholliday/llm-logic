            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf. This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the toy is in the toy box\" and B = \"it is sitting on the shelf\".\n2. The second premise states that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf, which means we can conclude that ~B (not B) is true.\n3. From the first premise, we know that either A or B must be true. Since we now know that ~B is true, it means that B cannot be true. Therefore, the only option left is that A must be true, i.e., \"the toy is in the toy box\".\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because it follows a correct pattern of reasoning:\n\n* We start with an \"or\" statement (A or B)\n* We eliminate one of the options (~B)\n* Therefore, we conclude that the other option must be true (A)\n\nAnswer: yes",
