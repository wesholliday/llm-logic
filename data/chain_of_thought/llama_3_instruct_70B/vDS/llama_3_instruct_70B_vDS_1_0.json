            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\". This is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities as alternatives.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Fido is not in the garden\". This negates one of the possibilities presented in the first premise.\n\n3. The conclusion draws from these premises that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical validity:\n\nSince the first premise presents a disjunction (either A or B), and the second premise negates one of those alternatives (not B), it logically follows that the other alternative must be true (A). In this case, if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n\nTherefore, the argument form is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
