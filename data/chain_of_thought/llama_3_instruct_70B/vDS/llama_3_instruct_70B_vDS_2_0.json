            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\". This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second premise states: \"The book isn't resting on the table\". This negates one of the options presented in the first premise.\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nSince the second premise negates the option \"the book is resting on the table\", we are left with only one possibility from the original disjunction: \"the book is on the shelf\". This means that if the first premise is true (i.e., either the book is on the shelf or it's on the table), and we know the book isn't on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
