            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head. This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A is \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" and B is \"the sunglasses are perched on her head\".\n2. The second premise states that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head, which means we can conclude that ~B (not B) is true.\n3. From the first premise, we know that A or B must be true. Since we now know that ~B is true, it means that B cannot be true. Therefore, the only option left is that A must be true, i.e., \"the sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because it follows a classic pattern of disjunctive syllogism:\n\nA or B\n~B\n\u2234 A\n\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
