This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the scarf.\n2. The second premise states that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack. This eliminates one of the two possible locations mentioned in the first premise.\n3. Given that the scarf isn't on the coat rack, and there are only two possible locations (backpack or coat rack), it logically follows that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
