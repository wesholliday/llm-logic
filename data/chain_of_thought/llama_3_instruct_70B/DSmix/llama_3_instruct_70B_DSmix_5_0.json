We are given: \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" (Statement A)\nThis implies that if the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The zinger might not be smoogled\" (Statement B)\nThis means that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements:\nIf the zinger might not be smoogled (Statement B), and either it's fraggled or it must be smoogled (Statement A), then the only other option left is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
