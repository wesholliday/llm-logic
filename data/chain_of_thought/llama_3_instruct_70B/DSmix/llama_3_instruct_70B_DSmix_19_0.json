We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The smonk might not be plagged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there are only two possible scenarios: \n   - The smonk is vreebled\n   - The smonk is plagged\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The smonk might not be plagged\". This implies that the possibility of the smonk being plagged is eliminated or at least uncertain.\n\n4. Combining our understanding from steps 2 and 3, we are left with only one possible scenario: \n   - The smonk is vreebled\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
