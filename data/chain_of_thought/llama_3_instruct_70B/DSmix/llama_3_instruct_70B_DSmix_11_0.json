We are given: \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" - This implies that if the flug is not blummed, then it must be zimmed.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The flug might not be zimmed\" - This implies that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the flug might not be zimmed (from statement 2), and if it's not blummed then it must be zimmed (from statement 1), then we can conclude that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
