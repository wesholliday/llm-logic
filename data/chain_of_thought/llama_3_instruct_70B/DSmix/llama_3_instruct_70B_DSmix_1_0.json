We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The flugel might not be zargled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The flugel might not be zargled\". This implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n\n4. Combining our inferences from Steps 2 and 3, if the flugel is not zargled (as suggested by Statement B), then according to Statement A, it must be blimmed.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that based on the given statements, it is possible to infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
