We are given: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" - This implies that if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The splat might not be quanked\" - This means that there's a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the splat might not be quanked (as stated in 2), and if it's not morphed then it must be quanked (as stated in 1), then we can conclude that the splat must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
