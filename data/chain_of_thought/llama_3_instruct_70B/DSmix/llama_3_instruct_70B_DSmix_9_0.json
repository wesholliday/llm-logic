We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The twonk might not be plinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that if the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The twonk might not be plinked\". This implies that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked.\n\n4. Combining our inferences from Steps 2 and 3, if the twonk is not plinked (as suggested by Statement B), then according to Statement A, it must be varnished.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that based on the given statements, it is possible to infer that \"The twonk is varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
