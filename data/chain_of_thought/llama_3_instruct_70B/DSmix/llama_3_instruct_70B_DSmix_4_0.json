We are given: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" - This implies that if the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The fribble might not be crinked\" - This means that there is a possibility that the fribble is not crinked.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the fribble might not be crinked, and if it's not snurgled then it must be crinked (from step 1), then we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
