We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The whiffle might not be tinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. This is because the statement says \"either...or\", implying an exclusive relationship between the two options.\n\n3. Now, let's examine Statement B: \"The whiffle might not be tinked\". This statement does not assert that the whiffle is definitely not tinked, but rather leaves open the possibility that it might not be tinked.\n\n4. Combining our understanding of Statements A and B, we can conclude that if the whiffle might not be tinked (as per Statement B), then according to Statement A, it must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
