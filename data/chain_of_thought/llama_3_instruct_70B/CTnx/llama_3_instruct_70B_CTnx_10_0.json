In other words, sproinging and garpling are mutually exclusive states for the wug.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nTo determine this, let's analyze the given statement again. If the wug is sproinged, it cannot be garpled. This means that if the wug is not sproinged, it could potentially be garpled (but we can't conclude that for sure).\n\nHowever, if we know that the wug is garpled, then it must not be sproinged, because sproinging and garpling are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can indeed infer: \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
