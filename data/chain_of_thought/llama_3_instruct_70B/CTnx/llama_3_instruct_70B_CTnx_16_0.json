            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\"\n\nThis can be rewritten in a more familiar form as: \"C \u2192 \u00acS\" (where C means \"the sneg was crampled\" and S means \"the sneg sproted the frink\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\"\n\nThis can be rewritten as: \"S \u2192 \u00acC\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's see if we can derive it from the original statement.\n\nFrom \"C \u2192 \u00acS\", we can apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that if P \u2192 Q, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. In this case, P = C and Q = \u00acS.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule, we get: \u00ac(\u00acS) \u2192 \u00acC, which simplifies to S \u2192 \u00acC\n\nThis is exactly what we wanted to infer! Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
