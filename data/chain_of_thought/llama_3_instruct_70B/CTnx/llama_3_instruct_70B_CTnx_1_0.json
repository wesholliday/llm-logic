This implies a connection between being blimmed and not being zargled.\n\nNow, consider the desired inference: \"Zargled \u2192 Not Blimmed\". If we assume the flugel is zargled, can we conclude it's not blimmed?\n\nNotice that the original statement doesn't provide direct information about what happens when the flugel is zargled. It only tells us what happens when it's blimmed.\n\nHowever, since \"Blimmed \u2192 Not Zargled\" implies a connection between being blimmed and not being zargled, we can infer that if the flugel is zargled, it cannot be blimmed (because being blimmed would imply not being zargled).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer: \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
