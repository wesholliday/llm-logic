However, we can use a simple logical manipulation to get from one to the other.\n\nSince \u00acV \u2192 \u00acP is true, we can infer that its contrapositive, P \u2192 \u00acV, is also true (as we already knew).\n\nNow, taking the contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acV again, we get:\n\n\u00ac(\u00acV) \u2192 \u00acP\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nV \u2192 \u00acP\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
