The two statements are actually contrapositives of each other. In other words, they are saying the same thing but with the conditions reversed.\n\nSince the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer: \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
