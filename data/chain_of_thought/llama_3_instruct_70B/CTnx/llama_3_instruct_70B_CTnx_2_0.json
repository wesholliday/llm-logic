The contrapositive of \"Flooped \u2192 \u00acBim\" is indeed \"Bim \u2192 \u00acFlooped\".\n\nIn general, if we have a statement \"A \u2192 B\", its contrapositive is \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". And it's a well-known fact in logic that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
