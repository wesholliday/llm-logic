In other words, if a flug has one property, it cannot have the other.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\"\n\nSince we know that blummed and zimmed are mutually exclusive, it makes sense to conclude that if a flug is zimmed, it cannot be blummed. This is because the original statement tells us that if a flug is blummed, it's not zimmed, so it's reasonable to assume the converse: if a flug is zimmed, it's not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
