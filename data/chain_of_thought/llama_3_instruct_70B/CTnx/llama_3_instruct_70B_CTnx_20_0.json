            "content": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nThis can be rewritten in a more formal logical notation as:\n\nBluttered \u2192 \u00acSurn\n\nWhere \"Bluttered\" represents the proposition \"the fleeg was bluttered\", and \"Surn\" represents the proposition \"it surned\". The arrow \"\u2192\" denotes implication, and \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nIn logical notation, this would be:\n\nSurn \u2192 \u00acBluttered\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, let's analyze the given statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"Bluttered \u2192 \u00acSurn\" is \"Surn \u2192 \u00acBluttered\", which is exactly what we want to infer.\n\nIn general, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can indeed infer: \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
