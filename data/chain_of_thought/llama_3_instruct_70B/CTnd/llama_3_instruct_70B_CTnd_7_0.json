If S is true (the customer was served), then \u00acP must be true (he was not served promptly).\n2. But what if P is true (the customer was served promptly)? We cannot conclude anything about S from the original statement.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only tells us that being served implies not being served promptly, but it does not provide any information about what happens when someone is served promptly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
