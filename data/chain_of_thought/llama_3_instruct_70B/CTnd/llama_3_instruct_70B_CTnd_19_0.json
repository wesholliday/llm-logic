There might be cases where directions were both provided and explained clearly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the opposite implication with certainty. The original statement only guarantees that if directions were provided, they were not explained clearly, but it does not provide any information about what happens when directions are explained clearly.\n\nAnswer: no",
