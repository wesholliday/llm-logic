In other words, if Ben studied, it means he didn't study diligently.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\"\n\nTo infer this, we need to check if it logically follows from the original statement. If Ben studied diligently, it would mean that he didn't just study (because studying and studying diligently are mutually exclusive). Therefore, it is possible to conclude that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not simply study.\n\nAnswer: yes",
