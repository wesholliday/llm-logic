In other words, a warm greeting is ruled out.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\"\n\nTo infer this, we would need to show that a warm greeting implies no greeting at all. However, this doesn't logically follow from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that if there was a greeting, it wasn't warm. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when there is a warm greeting. In particular, it doesn't imply that a warm greeting means there was no greeting at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
