However, the original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when the issue is addressed effectively. It only tells us that if the issue is addressed, it's not done so effectively.\n\nIn other words, the original statement doesn't give us any clues about the relationship between \"addressed effectively\" and \"not addressed.\" We can't logically conclude that addressing an issue effectively means it wasn't addressed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: no",
