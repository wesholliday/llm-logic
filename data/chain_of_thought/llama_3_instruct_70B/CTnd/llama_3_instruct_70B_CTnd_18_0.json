The converse would be: \"If the issue was not discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" However, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude this.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that a discussion implies a lack of depth, but it does not imply that a lack of depth means there was no discussion at all. There could be cases where the issue was discussed, albeit superficially.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
