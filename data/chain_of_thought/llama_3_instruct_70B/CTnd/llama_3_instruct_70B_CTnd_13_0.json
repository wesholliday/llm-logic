In other words, if Alex exercised, it means he didn't exercise much.\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\"\n\nIf we assume Alex exercised much, it would mean he didn't exercise (according to the proposed inference). But wait, exercising much is a form of exercising! So, if Alex exercised much, it means he did exercise.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If Alex exercised much, it means he both exercised and didn't exercise at the same time, which can't be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
