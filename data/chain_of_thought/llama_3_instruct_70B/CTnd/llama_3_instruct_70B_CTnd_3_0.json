In other words, if I ate a meal, it means I didn't eat a large meal.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\"\n\nIf we assume that eating a large meal implies I didn't eat a meal, it would mean that eating a large meal and eating a meal are also mutually exclusive. But this contradicts our initial understanding that eating a meal and eating a large meal are related (a large meal is a type of meal).\n\nTherefore, the proposed inference does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
