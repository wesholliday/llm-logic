In other words, if Ann exercises, it means she didn't exercise strenuously.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\"\n\nIf we assume Ann exercised strenuously, it would mean she didn't exercise (according to the proposed inference). But wait, exercising strenuously is a form of exercising! So, if Ann exercised strenuously, it means she did exercise.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If Ann exercised strenuously, then she must have exercised. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
