Therefore, if helpful advice were offered, it would mean that our initial assumption (all offered advice is unhelpful) is false.\n\nIn other words, the proposed inference is saying that if we have a situation where helpful advice was offered, then our initial assumption about all offered advice being unhelpful must be incorrect. This means that in such a scenario, advice cannot have been offered according to our initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
