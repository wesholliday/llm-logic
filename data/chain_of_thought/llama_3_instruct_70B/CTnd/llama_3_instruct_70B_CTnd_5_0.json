However, this does not necessarily imply that the room was not cleaned at all. In fact, \"cleaned thoroughly\" is a stronger statement than just \"cleaned,\" as it implies a more rigorous and complete cleaning process.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer from the original statement that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. The two statements are not equivalent, and the inference does not follow.\n\nAnswer: no",
