If P \u2192 \u00acQ is true, it means that whenever the meal is prepared (P), it is not prepared carefully (\u00acQ). However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the meal is prepared carefully (Q).\n\nIn particular, we cannot conclude that if the meal is prepared carefully (Q), then it was not prepared (\u00acP). There might be cases where a meal is both prepared and prepared carefully.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
