However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Q is true.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only tells us about the consequence of P being true, but it doesn't tell us anything about the consequence of Q being true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If instructions were explained clearly (Q), then instructions were not given (\u00acP)\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
