The original statement doesn't provide any direct information about what happens when a strong recommendation is made. It only tells us that if a recommendation is made, it's not strong.\n\nHowever, we can try to derive some information from the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive would be: \"If it was a strong recommendation, then no recommendation was made.\" This looks similar to what we're trying to infer.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\n\"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
