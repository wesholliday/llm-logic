However, this doesn't necessarily follow from the original statement.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that if a job is completed, it's likely to have some flaws. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when a job is completed well. In fact, it's possible that a job can be both \"completed\" and \"completed well.\"\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where a job is finished on time, within budget, and meets all the requirements. In this case, we could say that the job was both \"completed\" and \"completed well.\" This contradicts the proposed inference.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
