            "content": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. In other words, if Joe goes to the park, it guarantees that Lucy will go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nThis statement is trying to establish a connection between Joe not going to the park and Lucy not going to the zoo. However, the original statement only provides information about what happens when Joe goes to the park, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy will go to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Joe doesn't go to the park, Lucy won't go to the zoo. There might be other reasons why Lucy would or wouldn't go to the zoo regardless of Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
