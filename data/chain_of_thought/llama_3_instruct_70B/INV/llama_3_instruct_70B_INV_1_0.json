It does not provide any information about what happens if Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\"\n\nThis statement is saying that if Mary did not attend the wedding, then Sue must have also not attended. However, our original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Mary does not attend.\n\nIn fact, it's possible that Sue could have still attended the wedding even if Mary didn't. The original statement only guarantees that if Mary attends, Sue will also attend, but it doesn't guarantee the reverse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
