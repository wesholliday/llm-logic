            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe are given: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThis implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. In other words, if the condition \"Lisa buys the red shirt\" is true, then we can conclude that \"Mark buys the blue shirt\" is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n\nThis statement is trying to establish a connection between Lisa NOT buying the red shirt and Mark NOT buying the blue shirt. However, our original statement only tells us what happens when Lisa buys the red shirt, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Lisa does NOT buy the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that \"If Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt\" is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that \"If Lisa does not buy the red shirt, then Mark does not buy the blue shirt\" is also true. There might be cases where Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt, but Mark still buys the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no",
