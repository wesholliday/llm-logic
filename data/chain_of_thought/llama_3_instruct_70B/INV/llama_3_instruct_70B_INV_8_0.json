It does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nTo do this, we need to consider two possibilities:\n\n1. The vampire is not awake, but the mummy is awake.\n2. The vampire is not awake, and the mummy is not awake.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about scenario 1, so we cannot rule it out. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
