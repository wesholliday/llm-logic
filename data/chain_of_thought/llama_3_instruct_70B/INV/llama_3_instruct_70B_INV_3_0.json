            "content": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThis implies that if James wrote the book, we can be certain it's a mystery novel. However, it doesn't provide any information about books not written by James.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nThis statement assumes that if James didn't write the book, it cannot be a mystery novel. But the original statement only guarantees that James' books are mystery novels; it doesn't exclude the possibility of other authors writing mystery novels.\n\nIn other words, just because James writes mystery novels, it doesn't mean that no one else can write mystery novels. There might be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
