However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the car is not red.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nTo determine whether this inference is valid, we need to examine the possibilities:\n\n1. If the car is not red, but the truck is still blue (this scenario is possible because the original statement only talks about what happens when the car is red).\n2. If the car is not red, and the truck is also not blue (this scenario is also possible).\n\nSince we cannot rule out either of these possibilities based on the original statement, we cannot infer that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
