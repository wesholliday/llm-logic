This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn general, from \"If P, then Q\", we cannot directly infer \"If not P, then not Q\". This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when P is true, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when P is false.\n\nFor example, consider a different scenario: \"If it rains, then the street will be wet\". From this, we cannot infer \"If it doesn't rain, then the street will not be wet\", because there could be other reasons why the street is wet (e.g., a water main break).\n\nIn our original statement, just because we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, it doesn't mean that if the doll wasn't plastic, then the truck wasn't metal. There could be other scenarios where the doll isn't plastic, but the truck is still metal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot make a definitive inference about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
