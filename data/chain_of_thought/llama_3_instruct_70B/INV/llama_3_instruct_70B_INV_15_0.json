However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Sam does not take a plane.\n\nNow, we want to infer: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nBut wait! The original statement doesn't give us any information about the scenario where Sam doesn't take a plane. It only talks about what happens when Sam takes a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Sam didn't take a plane, Erin didn't take a train. There might be other possibilities, like Erin taking a train regardless of Sam's actions or not taking a train for some unrelated reason.\n\nAnswer: no",
