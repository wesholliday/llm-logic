However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTo infer \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry,\" we would need to assume that there is a direct connection between the cake being non-chocolate and the muffins being non-blueberry. But the original statement does not provide any evidence for this assumption.\n\nIn fact, it's possible that the muffins could be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. The original statement only tells us about the situation when the cake is chocolate, but it doesn't restrict the possibilities when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
