However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the condition \"the apple was red\" is false.\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nThis would imply that if the condition \"the apple was not red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was not yellow\" must also be true. However, there is no logical connection between the original statement and this inferred statement.\n\nIn other words, just because we know what happens when the apple is red (the banana is yellow), it does not necessarily tell us what happens when the apple is not red. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the banana's color in that case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
