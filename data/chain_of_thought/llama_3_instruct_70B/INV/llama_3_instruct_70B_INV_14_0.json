            "content": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWe are given the statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\". This is a conditional statement of the form \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn general, from a statement \"If P, then Q\", we cannot directly infer \"If not P, then not Q\". This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when P is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when P is false.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the street is wet.\" From this, we cannot infer \"If it's not raining, then the street is not wet\", because there could be other reasons why the street is wet (e.g., a water main break).\n\nSo, in our original case, from \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\", we cannot directly infer \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\".\n\nAnswer: no",
