However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTo infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\", we would need to know that there is a direct relationship between the shirt material and the pants material, such that if the shirt is not cotton, the pants must be something other than denim. But this information is not provided in the original statement.\n\nIn fact, it's possible that the pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton. The original statement only tells us about the situation when the shirt is cotton, but it doesn't restrict the possibilities when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
