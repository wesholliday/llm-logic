It does not provide any information about what happens when Alex doesn't finish the race.\n\nNow, we want to infer: \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\"\n\nHowever, there is no logical connection between the original statement and this inferred statement. The original statement only talks about what happens when Alex finishes the race, but it says nothing about what happens when Alex doesn't finish.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make any conclusions about Chris's finishing status based on Alex not finishing the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
