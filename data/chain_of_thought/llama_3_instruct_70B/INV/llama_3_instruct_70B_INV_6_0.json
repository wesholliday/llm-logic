However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nNow, we want to infer: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nBut wait! The original statement doesn't give us any information about what Bob would do if Sue didn't choose pizza. It only tells us what Bob would do if Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Sue didn't choose pizza, Bob didn't choose pasta. There might be other possibilities for Bob's choice when Sue doesn't choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
