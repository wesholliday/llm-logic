It does not provide any information about what happens when the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nNow, we want to infer: \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\"\n\nThis statement is trying to establish a connection between the absence of the griffin and the absence of the unicorn. However, our original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the griffin is absent.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn, it does not necessarily mean that the absence of the griffin implies the absence of the unicorn. There could be cases where the unicorn is present even if the griffin is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
