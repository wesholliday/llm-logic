However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nIn particular, we cannot conclude that if Jeff did not play basketball, Amy did not play tennis. There might be cases where Jeff didn't play basketball, but Amy still played tennis.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where Amy always plays tennis, regardless of whether Jeff plays basketball or not. In this case, the original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true, but it does not imply that if Jeff didn't play basketball, Amy wouldn't have played tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
