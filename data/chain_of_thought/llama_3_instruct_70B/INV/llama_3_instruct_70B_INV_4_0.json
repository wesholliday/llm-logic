The alien did not visit Mars.\n2. The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nIn scenario 1, the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" is false. However, our original statement only guarantees that if the alien visits Mars, then the robot visits Jupiter. It does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars.\n\nIn scenario 2, the consequence \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is true. But again, our original statement does not restrict the robot's actions when the alien does not visit Mars.\n\nSince we cannot conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter solely based on the fact that the alien did not visit Mars, we cannot infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
