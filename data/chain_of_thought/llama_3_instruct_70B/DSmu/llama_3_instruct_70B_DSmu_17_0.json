This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\". This negates the possibility of the scarf being draped on the coat rack.\n\n3. Since we know that either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack, and we've eliminated the possibility of it being draped on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
