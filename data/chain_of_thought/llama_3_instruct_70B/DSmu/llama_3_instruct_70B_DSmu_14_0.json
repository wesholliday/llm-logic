This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the milk is on the counter\" and B = \"it must be chilling in the fridge\".\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\". This can be represented as \"not B\".\n\n3. From the initial statement, we know that either A or B (or both) must be true.\n\n4. But now we're told that B is not true (from the second statement). Therefore, since A or B must be true, and B is not true, it must be the case that A is true.\n\n5. So, we can conclude that \"The milk is on the counter\" (A) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
