We have the statement: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This negates the second option from the first statement.\n\n3. Since the second option (sunglasses perched on her head) is eliminated, and we know one of the two options must be true (from the first statement), then the only remaining possibility is that \"the sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
