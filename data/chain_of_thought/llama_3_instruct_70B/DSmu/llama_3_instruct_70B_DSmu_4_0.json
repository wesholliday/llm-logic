This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A is \"the cat is napping on the couch\" and B is \"it must be playing in the bedroom\".\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\". This can be represented as \"not B\".\n\n3. From the original statement, we know that either A or B (or both) must be true.\n\n4. But now we're told that B is not true (not B). Therefore, since A or B must be true, and B is not true, it must be the case that A is true.\n\n5. So, yes, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
