This is a disjunction, which means one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\", which negates the second option of the disjunction.\n3. Since the second option is false, and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), it means the first option \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
