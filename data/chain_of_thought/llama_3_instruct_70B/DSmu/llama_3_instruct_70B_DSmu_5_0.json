This is an \"or\" statement, which means that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\". This negates the possibility of the cookies being hidden in the pantry.\n\n3. Now, going back to the first statement, since the possibility of the cookies being hidden in the pantry is eliminated, we are left with only one option: the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
