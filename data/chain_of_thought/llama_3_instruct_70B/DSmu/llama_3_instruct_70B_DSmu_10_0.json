This implies that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" (let's call this statement B)\n4. Statement B can be rewritten as \"The missing sock does not have to be under the bed\", which means it could be somewhere else.\n5. Combining statements A and B, we know that if the missing sock is not under the bed (which is possible according to B), then it must be in the laundry basket (according to A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
