The original statement is \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and B is \"it must be hiding under the couch\".\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\". This can be represented as \"not B\".\n\n3. From the original statement, we know that A or B must be true. If not B (i.e., it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch), then the only option left is A.\n\n4. Therefore, if not B, then A must be true. In other words, if it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
