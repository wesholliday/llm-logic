This is an \"or\" statement, which means that if one option is not true, the other option must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\". This means that the option \"they must be lined up by the door\" is false.\n\n3. Since the first statement is an \"or\" statement and one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true. In this case, the other option is \"the shoes are in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
