It implies that one of these options must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" - This statement negates option B, implying that it's not blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince option B is ruled out, and we know that either A or B must be true (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility is A: \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
