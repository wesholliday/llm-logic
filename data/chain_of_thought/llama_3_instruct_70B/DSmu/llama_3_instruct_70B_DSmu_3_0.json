This is an \"or\" statement, which means that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\". This negates the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet.\n\n3. Now, going back to the first statement, since the option \"they must be dangling in the cabinet\" is false (as stated in the second statement), we are left with only one possibility: \"the keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
