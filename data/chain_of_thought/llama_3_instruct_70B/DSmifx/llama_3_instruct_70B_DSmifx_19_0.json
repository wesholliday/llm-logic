We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The smonk might not be plagged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there are only two possible scenarios: \n   - The smonk is plagged\n   - The smonk is vreebled\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The smonk might not be plagged\". This implies that the possibility of the smonk being plagged is uncertain or unknown.\n\n4. Combining our understanding from steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the smonk might not be plagged (Statement B), then it must be vreebled, as per Statement A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
