This can be rewritten as \"If the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled\" (using the rule of inference called \"material implication\").\n\n2. We also know that \"The flob might not be movated\", which means there's a possibility that the flob is not movated.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements: if the flob might not be movated, and if it's not movated then it's skizzled (from step 1), we can conclude that the flob is likely to be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
