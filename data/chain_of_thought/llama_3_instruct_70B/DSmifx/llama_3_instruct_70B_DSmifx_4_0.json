            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\". This can be represented as \"Crinked \u2228 Snurgled\" (where \"\u2228\" denotes the logical OR operator).\n2. We are also given: \"The fribble might not be crinked\". This implies that the possibility of the fribble being crinked is not certain, i.e., it could be false. Let's represent this as \"\u00acCrinked\" (where \"\u00ac\" denotes the logical NOT operator).\n3. Now, let's analyze the given statements:\n   - If the fribble must be crinked or snurgled (Crinked \u2228 Snurgled), and\n   - The fribble might not be crinked (\u00acCrinked),\n\n   then we can infer that if it's not crinked, it must be snurgled. This is because the first statement provides two possibilities: either crinked or snurgled. If the fribble is not crinked, the only remaining possibility is that it is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
