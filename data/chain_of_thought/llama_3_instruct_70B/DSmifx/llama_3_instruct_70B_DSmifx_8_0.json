We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the sprocket is not daggled, then it is cranked\" (using the rule of inference that \"A or B\" is equivalent to \"not A implies B\").\n\n3. From Statement B, we know that the possibility of the sprocket not being daggled exists.\n\n4. Now, let's combine the rewritten Statement A with the information from Statement B: If the sprocket might not be daggled (Statement B), and if it is not daggled then it is cranked (rewritten Statement A), we can infer that the sprocket is likely to be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
