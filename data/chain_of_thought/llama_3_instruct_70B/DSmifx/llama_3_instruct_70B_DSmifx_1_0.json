We have two statements:\n   - \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The flugel might not be zargled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the flugel is not zargled, then it is blimmed\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. From Statement B, we know that the possibility of the flugel not being zargled exists.\n\n4. Now, let's combine the information from steps 2 and 3: If the flugel might not be zargled, and if it is not zargled then it is blimmed (from step 2), we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
