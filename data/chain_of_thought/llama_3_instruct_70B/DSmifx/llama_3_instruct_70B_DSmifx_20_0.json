We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The fleeg might not be surned\" (Statement B)\n\n2. From Statement A, we can infer that there are only two possible scenarios: \n   - The fleeg must be surned\n   - It is bluttered\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement B: \"The fleeg might not be surned\". This implies that the possibility of the fleeg being surned is uncertain or unknown.\n\n4. Combining our understanding from steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the fleeg might not be surned (Statement B), then it must be bluttered, as per Statement A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
