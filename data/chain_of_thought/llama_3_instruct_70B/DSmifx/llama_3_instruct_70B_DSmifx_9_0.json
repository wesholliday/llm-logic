We are given: \"Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked\" (disjunction)\nThis means that one of the two options must be true: either the twonk is varnished, or it is plinked.\n\n2. We are also given: \"The twonk might not be plinked\" (possibility of negation)\nThis implies that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the disjunction from step 1:\nIf the twonk is not plinked (as suggested by step 2), then the only remaining option in the disjunction is that \"the twonk must be varnished\".\n\n4. Therefore, considering both statements together, we can infer that if the twonk might not be plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
