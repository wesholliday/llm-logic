We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"The whiffle might not be tinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as: \"If the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked\" (using the rule of inference that \"P or Q\" is equivalent to \"not P implies Q\").\n\n3. From Statement B, we know that the possibility of the whiffle not being tinked exists.\n\n4. Now, let's combine the rewritten Statement A with the information from Statement B: If the whiffle might not be tinked (Statement B), and if it is not tinked then it is shanked (rewritten Statement A), we can conclude that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
