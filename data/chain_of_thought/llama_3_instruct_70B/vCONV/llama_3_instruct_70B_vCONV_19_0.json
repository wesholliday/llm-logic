In other words, can we guarantee that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true?\n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion have a similar structure, but with the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and consequent (the \"then\" part) swapped.\n\nIn logic, this type of argument is called \"converse implication.\" Unfortunately, converse implication is not a logically valid inference rule. In other words, just because P \u2192 Q is true, it does not necessarily follow that Q \u2192 P is also true.\n\nTo see why, consider a counterexample:\n\nSuppose Tom watched football (P), and as a result, Jen watched basketball (Q). This satisfies the premise. However, it's possible that Jen would have watched basketball even if Tom didn't watch football. In this scenario, the conclusion \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. The argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
