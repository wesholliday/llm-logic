This implies that if Jeff played basketball, it necessarily means Amy played tennis. However, it does not imply the converse, i.e., if Amy played tennis, it does not necessarily mean Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe conclusion tries to infer the converse, which is not justified by the premise alone. In other words, just because we know that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\", we cannot conclude that \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\".\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
