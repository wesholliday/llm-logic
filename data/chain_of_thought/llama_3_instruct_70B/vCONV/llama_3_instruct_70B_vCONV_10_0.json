This is a classic case of a logical fallacy called \"converse error\".\n\nIn general, just because p implies q, it does not necessarily mean that q implies p. For example, \"If it's raining, then the street will be wet\" does not imply \"If the street is wet, then it's raining\". There could be other reasons why the street is wet.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is NOT logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
