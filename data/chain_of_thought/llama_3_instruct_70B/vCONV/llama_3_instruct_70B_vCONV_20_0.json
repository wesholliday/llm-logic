The premise states that if one condition is true (apple is red), then another condition must be true (banana is yellow). However, the conclusion tries to reverse this implication, stating that if the second condition is true (banana is yellow), then the first condition must be true (apple is red).\n\nUnfortunately, this reversal is not logically justified. Just because we know that p \u2192 q, it does not necessarily mean that q \u2192 p. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow, unrelated to the apple's color.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
