This is a classic case of a logical fallacy called \"converse error\".\n\nIn general, just because p implies q, it does not necessarily mean that q implies p. For example, \"If it's raining, then the streets are wet\" does not imply \"If the streets are wet, then it's raining\". There could be other reasons why the streets are wet.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is NOT logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
