In this case, we have:\n\np \u2192 q (premise)\n\u2234 q \u2192 p (conclusion)\n\nThis form of argument is actually an example of a logical fallacy called \"converse error\". The converse of a conditional statement \"if p then q\" is not necessarily true.\n\nTo see why, consider the following counterexample:\n\nSuppose the bear was in the case, and indeed, the wolf was in the den. This satisfies the premise (p \u2192 q). However, it does not necessarily mean that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must be in the case. There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den, unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\" solely based on the premise \"if the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den\".\n\nAnswer: no",
