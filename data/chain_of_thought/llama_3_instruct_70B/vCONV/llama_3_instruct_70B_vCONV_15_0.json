This implies a conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n\nHowever, the conclusion reverses this conditional relationship, stating that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. This is not necessarily true based on the original premise.\n\nIn fact, we can imagine a scenario where Sam did not take a plane, but Erin still took a train. In this case, the premise would be false (since Sam didn't take a plane), but the conclusion would still be true (since Erin took a train).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
