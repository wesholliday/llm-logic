            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (M \u2192 S)\nConclusion: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding (S \u2192 M)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too. This implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nHowever, the conclusion tries to reverse this conditional relationship, stating that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been there too. But this is not necessarily true.\n\nJust because Mary's presence implies Sue's presence (M \u2192 S), it does not mean that Sue's presence implies Mary's presence (S \u2192 M). There could be scenarios where Sue attends the wedding without Mary being present.\n\nFor example, imagine a situation where Sue is a close friend of the bride, but Mary is not. In this case, Sue might attend the wedding even if Mary doesn't. This would satisfy the premise (M \u2192 S), but not the conclusion (S \u2192 M).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
