The cat was outside (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees one direction: \"dog inside\" implies \"cat outside\", but it does not guarantee the reverse implication: \"cat outside\" does not necessarily imply \"dog inside\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce with certainty that \"The dog was inside\".\n\nAnswer: no",
