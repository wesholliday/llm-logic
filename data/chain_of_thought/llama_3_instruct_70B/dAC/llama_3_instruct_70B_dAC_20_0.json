The banana was yellow (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the banana is yellow, the apple must be red.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the implication in one direction: \"apple red\" \u2192 \"banana yellow\". It does not guarantee the converse implication: \"banana yellow\" \u2192 \"apple red\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce with certainty that \"The apple was red\" simply because \"The banana was yellow\".\n\nAnswer: no",
