The pants were denim (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the pants are denim, the shirt must be cotton.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, the pants will be denim, but it does not guarantee the converse: that if the pants are denim, the shirt must be cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce with certainty that \"The shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: no",
