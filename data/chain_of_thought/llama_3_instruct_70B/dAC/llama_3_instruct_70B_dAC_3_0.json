The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. But this does not necessarily mean that only James can write a mystery novel. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, this information alone does not provide any direct connection to James being the author.\n\nSince we cannot rule out the possibility of another author writing a mystery novel, we cannot conclude with certainty that James wrote the book simply because it's a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot deduce that \"The book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: no",
