Amy played tennis (fact)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, let's examine the conditional statement (1). It says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since we already know that Amy played tennis (from statement 2), it seems like we can conclude that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nHowever, this is where we need to be careful. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not guarantee the converse: that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n\nIn other words, just because Amy played tennis, it doesn't necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce with certainty that Jeff played basketball based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
