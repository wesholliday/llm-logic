If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (implies that if Alex finished, Chris must have finished too)\n2. Chris finished the race\n\nNow, we want to deduce whether Alex finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know Chris finished the race. But this doesn't directly tell us about Alex's status. \n\nWe can try to use statement 1 to connect Chris's finish to Alex's finish. However, statement 1 only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris would have finished too. It does not provide a guarantee in the reverse direction - just because Chris finished, it doesn't necessarily mean Alex finished.\n\nIn other words, there could be scenarios where Chris finished the race without Alex finishing (e.g., Chris was faster or had an advantage). \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
