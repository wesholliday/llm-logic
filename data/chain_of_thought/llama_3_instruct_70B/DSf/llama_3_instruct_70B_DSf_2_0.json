This implies that there are only two possible locations for the book: the table or the shelf.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The book isn't resting on the table\". This tells us that the book is not in one of the two possible locations mentioned in step 1, which is the table.\n\n3. Since the book can't be on the table (from step 2), and there are only two possible locations for the book (from step 1), it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
