We are given the statement \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This implies that there are only two possible locations for the phone: the kitchen or the living room.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\" This tells us that the first option (the phone ringing in the kitchen) is not true.\n\n3. Since we know that either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room, and the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, then the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
