We are given two statements: \n   a) Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n   b) The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: either it's blending in on the floor or it's in the box.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the first option, \"blending in on the floor\", is not true. This means we can eliminate this possibility.\n\n4. Since there are only two options and one of them has been eliminated, the remaining option must be true: the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
