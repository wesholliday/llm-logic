We have two statements: \n   a) Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n   b) The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible scenarios for the sunglasses' location: either on her head or in her bag.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities - the sunglasses being perched on her head - is not true.\n\n4. Since there are only two options, and one has been eliminated, we can logically conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
