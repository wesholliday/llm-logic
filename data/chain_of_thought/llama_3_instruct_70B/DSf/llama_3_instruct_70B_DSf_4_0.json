We are given two statements: \n   - Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch (A or B)\n   - The cat isn't playing in the bedroom (~A)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that either A (playing in the bedroom) or B (napping on the couch) must be true.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A (playing in the bedroom) is not true.\n\n4. Since A is not true and A or B must be true, then B (napping on the couch) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
