We are given the statement: \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This implies that there are only two possible locations for the notebook, and one of them must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This tells us that the first option (the notebook being on the nightstand) is not true.\n\n3. Since we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and the first option is false (from step 2), it logically follows that the second option must be true: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
