This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\". This tells us that the first option (the jacket being in the closet) is not true.\n\n3. Since the first option is not true, and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), then the second option (the jacket being draped over the chair) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
