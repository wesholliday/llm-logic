We are given the statement \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\" This implies that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the shelf or the toy box.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" This means we can eliminate the possibility of the toy being on the shelf.\n\n3. Since there are only two possible locations (shelf or toy box) and we've eliminated the shelf, that leaves us with only one remaining option: the toy box.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
