We are given two statements:\n   - Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\n   - The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the umbrella: the closet or the car.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4. Since the umbrella can only be in one of these two locations and it's not in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
