The statement \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" implies that these are the only two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n3. The second statement \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" eliminates one of the possibilities, leaving us with only one option: the laundry basket.\n\nSince we've eliminated the possibility of the sock being under the bed, and there are only two possible locations, it logically follows that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
