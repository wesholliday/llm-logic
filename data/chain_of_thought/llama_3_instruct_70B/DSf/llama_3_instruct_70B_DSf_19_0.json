This implies that there are only two possible scenarios: the watch is either on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"The watch isn't on his wrist\". This eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in step 1, which means the watch cannot be on his wrist.\n\n3. Since we know the watch can't be on his wrist (from step 2), and there are only two possible scenarios (from step 1), it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
