We are given two statements: \n   a) Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n   b) The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either it's on the coat rack or it's in the backpack.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack. \n\n4. Since the scarf can't be on the coat rack, and there are only two possible locations according to statement (a), we can conclude that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
