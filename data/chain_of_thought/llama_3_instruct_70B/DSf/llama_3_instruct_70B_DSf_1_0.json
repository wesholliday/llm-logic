This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n2. We are also given the statement \"Fido is not in the garden\". This tells us that the first option (\"Fido is in the garden\") is false.\n3. Since the first option is false, and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), it means that the second option (\"Fido is inside\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
