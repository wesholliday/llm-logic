We are given two statements: \n   a) Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n   b) The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that there are only two possible locations for the remote control: under the couch or on the coffee table.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the remote control is not under the couch. \n\n4. Since the remote control can only be in one of these two locations, and it's not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
