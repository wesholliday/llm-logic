This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The pen isn't on my desk\". This tells us that the first option (the pen being on the desk) is not true.\n\n3. Since the first option is not true, and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), then the only remaining possibility is that the second option (the pen being in my bag) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
