The statement \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning if one is true, the other must be false.\n3. The second statement \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" tells us that the first option (pantry) is not true.\n4. Since the two options are mutually exclusive, and we know the first option (pantry) is not true, it logically follows that the second option (jar) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
