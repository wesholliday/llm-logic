It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch (i.e., the newspaper does not have to be on the porch)\n2. Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\n\nBut statement 1 tells us that the second possibility (it must be sitting on the porch) is not true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
