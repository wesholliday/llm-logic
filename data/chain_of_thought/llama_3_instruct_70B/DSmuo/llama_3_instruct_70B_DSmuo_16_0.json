We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as \"The pen does not have to be on my desk\". This implies that there might be other possibilities for the pen's location.\n\n3. Statement B presents two options: the pen is either in the bag or it must be on the desk. \n\n4. Since we know from statement A that the pen doesn't have to be on the desk, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
