However, statement 2 says that either the book is on the shelf or it must be on the table. If the book is not necessarily on the table (due to statement 1), then the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
