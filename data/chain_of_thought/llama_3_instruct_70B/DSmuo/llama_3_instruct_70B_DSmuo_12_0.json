We are given two statements:\n   - It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet (\u00acMustHang)\n   - Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet (Drape \u2228 MustHang)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the jacket does not necessarily have to be hanging in the closet.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement:\n   - It says either the jacket is draped over the chair (Drape) or it must be hanging in the closet (MustHang).\n   - Since we already know from the first statement that MustHang is false (\u00acMustHang), the only possibility left is Drape.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
