We are given two statements:\n   - It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet (\u00acMustBeInCloset)\n   - Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet (UmbrellaInCar \u2228 MustBeInCloset)\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the umbrella does not necessarily have to be in the closet.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second statement:\n   - It says either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n   - Since we know from step 2 that the umbrella doesn't necessarily have to be in the closet (\u00acMustBeInCloset), \n     the only other option left is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the umbrella is indeed in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
