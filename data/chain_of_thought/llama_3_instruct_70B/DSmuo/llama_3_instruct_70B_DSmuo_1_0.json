            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" (\u00ac\u25a1GF, where \u25a1 represents necessity or obligation)\n   - \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" (FI \u2228 \u25a1GF, where FI represents \"Fido is inside\")\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that it's not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the second premise: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". This is an \"or\" statement (disjunction), which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\n4. Since we know from the first premise that it's not necessary for Fido to be in the garden (\u00ac\u25a1GF), the second option \"Fido must be in the garden\" cannot be true.\n\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the first option \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
