We have two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is an \"either-or\" statement, which means it presents two possibilities:\n   - The sunglasses are in her bag\n   - They must be perched on her head\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement A: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\". This statement negates the second possibility presented in statement B.\n\n4. Since statement A negates the second possibility (\"they must be perched on her head\"), we are left with only one option from statement B: \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
