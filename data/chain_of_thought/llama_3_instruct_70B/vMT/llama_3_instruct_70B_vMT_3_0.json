            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"J \u2192 M\", where J represents \"the book was written by James\" and M represents \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion states: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acJ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise (J \u2192 M), we know that if J is true, then M must also be true.\n\nFrom the second premise (\u00acM), we know that M is false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since M is false and J \u2192 M, J must also be false. This is because if J were true, it would imply M, but we know M is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \u00acJ (\"The book was not written by James\") logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
