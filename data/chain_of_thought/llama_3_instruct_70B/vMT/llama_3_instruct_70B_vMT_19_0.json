            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"Jen did not watch basketball\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Tom did not watch football\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Tom watched football (p), then Jen must have watched basketball (q). However, premise 2 tells us that Jen did not watch basketball (\u223cq).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since q is false (\u223cq) and p \u2192 q, it must be the case that p is also false (\u223cp). In other words, if Tom had watched football (p), then Jen would have watched basketball (q), but since Jen didn't watch basketball (\u223cq), Tom couldn't have watched football (\u223cp).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" (\u223cp) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
