            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acU\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acG\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise (G \u2192 U), we know that if G is true, then U must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that U is false (\u00acU). Therefore, we can conclude that G cannot be true, because if it were, U would have to be true as well.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a logically valid argument form. It has the following structure:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\". The argument is logically valid because it follows the correct logical structure.\n\nAnswer: yes",
