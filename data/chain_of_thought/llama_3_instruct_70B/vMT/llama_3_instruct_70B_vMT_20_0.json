The second premise states: \"The banana was not yellow\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"The apple was not red\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use a simple rule of inference called modus tollens:\n\nModus Tollens: If p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n* p \u2192 q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n* \u223cq (The banana was not yellow)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n\u223cp (The apple was not red)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises using a valid rule of inference, this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
