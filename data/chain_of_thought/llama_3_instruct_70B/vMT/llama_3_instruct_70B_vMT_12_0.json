            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". This can be represented as \"J \u2192 L\", where J represents \"Joe went to the park\" and L represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. The second premise states: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\". This can be represented as \"\u00acL\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Joe did not go to the park\". This can be represented as \"\u00acJ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise (J \u2192 L), we know that if J is true, then L must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that L is actually false (\u00acL). Therefore, we can conclude that J cannot be true, because if it were, L would have to be true as well.\n\nThis means that the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion \u00acJ follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
