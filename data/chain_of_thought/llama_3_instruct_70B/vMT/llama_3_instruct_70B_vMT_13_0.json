            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"R \u2192 B\", where R represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The truck was not blue.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acB\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"The car was not red.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acR\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf R \u2192 B (first premise) and \u00acB (second premise), then we can conclude that \u00acR (conclusion). This is because if the truck was not blue (\u00acB), and the car being red implies the truck being blue (R \u2192 B), then it must be the case that the car was not red (\u00acR).\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a logically valid argument form. It has the following structure:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the car was red\" and Q represents \"the truck was blue\". The argument follows the correct logical structure, making it logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
