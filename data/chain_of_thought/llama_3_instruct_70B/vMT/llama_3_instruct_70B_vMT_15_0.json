The second premise states: \"Erin did not take a train\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sam did not take a plane\" (\u223cp)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n* If p \u2192 q is true, and q is false (\u223cq), then we can conclude that p must be false (\u223cp). This is because if p were true, it would imply q, but since q is false, p cannot be true.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a logically valid argument form. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: yes",
