            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"L \u2192 M\", where L represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and M represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n2. The second premise states: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acL\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf L \u2192 M (first premise) and \u00acM (second premise), then we can infer that \u00acL (conclusion). This is because if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt (\u00acM), and Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark buying the blue shirt (L \u2192 M), then it must be the case that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (\u00acL).\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a logically valid argument form. It has the following structure:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The argument follows the correct logical structure, making it logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
