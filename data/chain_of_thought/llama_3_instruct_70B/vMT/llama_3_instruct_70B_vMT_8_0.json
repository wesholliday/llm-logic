            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise (V \u2192 M), we know that if V is true, then M must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that M is false (\u00acM). Therefore, we can conclude that V cannot be true, because if it were, M would have to be true as well.\n\nThis means that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion \u00acV follows necessarily from the premises V \u2192 M and \u00acM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
