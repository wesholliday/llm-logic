            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". This can be represented as \"B \u2192 W\", where B represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and W represents \"the wolf was in the den\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The wolf was not in the den\". This can be represented as \"\u00acW\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"The bear was not in the cave\". This can be represented as \"\u00acB\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise (B \u2192 W), we know that if B is true, then W must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that W is false (\u00acW). Therefore, we can conclude that B cannot be true, because if it were, W would have to be true as well.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a logically valid inference rule. It states that if you have an implication \"A \u2192 B\" and you know that B is false (\u00acB), then you can conclude that A must also be false (\u00acA).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nB \u2192 W (premise)\n\u00acW (premise)\n\u2234 \u00acB (conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
