            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"The cat was not outside\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"The dog was not inside\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use a technique called modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\nIf p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\np \u2192 q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n\u223cq (The cat was not outside)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n\u223cp (The dog was not inside)\n\nSince the conclusion (\u223cp) logically follows from the premises (p \u2192 q and \u223cq), this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
