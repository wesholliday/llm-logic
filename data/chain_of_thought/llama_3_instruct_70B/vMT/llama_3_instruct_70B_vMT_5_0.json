            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"Amy did not play tennis\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Jeff played basketball (p), then Amy must have played tennis (q). However, premise 2 tells us that Amy did not play tennis (\u223cq).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\n\"If p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\"\n\nIn this case, if Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis, and Amy did not play tennis, then it must be the case that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
