            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"The muffins were not blueberry\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cake was not chocolate\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use a simple rule of inference called modus tollens:\n\nModus Tollens: If p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n* p \u2192 q (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n* \u223cq (The muffins were not blueberry)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n* \u223cp (The cake was not chocolate)\n\nSince the conclusion (\u223cp) logically follows from the premises (p \u2192 q and \u223cq), this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
