            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. The second premise states: \"Sue was not at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"\u00acS\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was not at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf M \u2192 S (first premise) and \u00acS (second premise), then we can infer that \u00acM (conclusion). This is because if Mary being at the wedding implies Sue being at the wedding, and Sue was not at the wedding, then it must be the case that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a logically valid argument form. It has the following structure:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\". The argument follows the correct logical structure, making it logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
