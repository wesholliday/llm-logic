            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"The truck was not metal\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"The doll was not plastic\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use a technique called modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\nIf p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\np \u2192 q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal)\n\u223cq (The truck was not metal)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer:\n\n\u223cp (The doll was not plastic)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises using a valid rule of inference, this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
