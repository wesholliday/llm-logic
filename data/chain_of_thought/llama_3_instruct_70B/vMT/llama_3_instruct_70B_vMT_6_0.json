            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (denoted as P \u2192 Q)\n2. The second premise states: \"Bob did not choose pasta\" (\u223cQ)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (\u223cP)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nFrom the first premise (P \u2192 Q), we know that if Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob must have chosen pasta (Q). However, the second premise tells us that Bob did not choose pasta (\u223cQ).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q and \u223cQ, then \u223cP\n\nIn this case, if \"Sue chose pizza\" implies \"Bob chose pasta\", and we know that \"Bob did not choose pasta\", then it must be the case that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
