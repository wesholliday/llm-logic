            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first statement says \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\n2. The second statement says \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\". This suggests that it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\n3. Now, let's think about what would happen if Lisa did buy the red shirt. According to the first statement, this would mean Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But we know from the second statement that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction, because if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark should have bought the blue shirt, but it's possible he didn't.\n\n4. To avoid this contradiction, we need to assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This way, the conditional relationship in the first statement is never triggered, and we don't have a problem with Mark possibly not buying the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
