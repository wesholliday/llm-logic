We can rewrite this as: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" (contrapositive)\n\nNow, we are also given: \"The pants might not have been denim\"\n\n3. From step 2, if the pants might not have been denim, it implies that the shirt might not have been cotton.\n\n4. Since we can't be certain about the pants being denim or not, we can conclude that the shirt was likely not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
