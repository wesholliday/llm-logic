We are given: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" (implies that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake)\n2. We are also given: \"The mummy might not have been awake\" (there's a possibility that the mummy was not awake)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then according to statement 1, the mummy must have been awake.\n* But we know from statement 2 that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that if the vampire was awake, it would contradict statement 2 (because the mummy would have to be awake, but it might not have been).\n* Therefore, for statement 2 to be true, the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
