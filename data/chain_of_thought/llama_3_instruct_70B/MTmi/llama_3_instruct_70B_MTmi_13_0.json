            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can rewrite this as: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" (contrapositive)\n\nNow, we are also given: \"The truck might not have been blue\"\n\n3. From step 2, if the truck might not have been blue, it implies that the car might not have been red.\n\nHowever, to conclude that \"The car was not red\", we need to be certain that the truck was not blue. But all we know is that \"The truck might not have been blue\", which means there's still a possibility that the truck was blue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: no",
