We can rewrite this as: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" (contrapositive)\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n3. \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" implies that it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nUsing our rewritten conditional statement from step 2, we can conclude:\n4. If it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest (from step 3), then it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest (from step 2).\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin was definitely not in the forest. We can only infer that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
