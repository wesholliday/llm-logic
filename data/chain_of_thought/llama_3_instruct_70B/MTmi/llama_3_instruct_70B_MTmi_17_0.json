We are given the conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This implies that if Ben ate pasta, Kate definitely ate salad.\n\n2. Now, we are also told that \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This means that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n\n3. If Kate did not eat salad, and the conditional statement in (1) is true, then it must be the case that Ben did not eat pasta. Because if Ben had eaten pasta, Kate would have definitely eaten salad, which contradicts our assumption that Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
