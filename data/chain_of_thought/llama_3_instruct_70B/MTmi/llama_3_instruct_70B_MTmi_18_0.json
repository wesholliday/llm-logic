            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This implies a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the implications of these two statements together. If the truck might not have been metal, it means that the condition for the doll being plastic (i.e., the truck being metal) is not fulfilled.\n\n4. Since the conditional relationship is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" and we know that the truck might not have been metal, we can infer that the doll was likely not plastic. This is because if the doll were plastic, the truck would have to be metal, but we know that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
