We can rephrase this implication as: \"If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex couldn't have finished the race\" (Contrapositive)\n3. Now, we are also given: \"Chris might not have finished the face\" (Possibility of Chris not finishing)\n4. From step 2, if Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex couldn't have finished the race.\n5. Since there's a possibility that Chris didn't finish the race (step 3), we can conclude that Alex must not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
