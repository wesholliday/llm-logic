We can rephrase this implication as: \"If Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" (Contrapositive)\n3. Now, we are also given: \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" (Possibility of negation)\n\nFrom step 2, if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\nIn step 3, we know that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means there is a possibility that Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n\nIf Lucy didn't go to the zoo (which is possible), then from step 2, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
