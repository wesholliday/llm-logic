We can rewrite this implication as: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" (Contrapositive)\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\". This implies that it is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\n3. Using the contrapositive from step 2, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSo, taking into account both statements, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
