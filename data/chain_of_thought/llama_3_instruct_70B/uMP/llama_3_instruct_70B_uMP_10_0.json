From the second statement, we know that the dog was indeed inside.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze the first statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if A, then B\". Since we know that the condition \"A\" (the dog being inside) is true, we can infer that the consequence \"B\" (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
