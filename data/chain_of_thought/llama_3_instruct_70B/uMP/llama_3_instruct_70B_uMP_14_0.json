From statement 1, we know that if the condition \"the bear was in the cave\" is true, then it implies that \"the wolf was in the den\" is also true.\n\n3. Statement 2 confirms that the condition \"the bear was in the cave\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Therefore, using the implication from statement 1, we can conclude that \"the wolf was in the den\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
