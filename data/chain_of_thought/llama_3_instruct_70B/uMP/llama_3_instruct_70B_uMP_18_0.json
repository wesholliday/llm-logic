We are given a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then M\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and M is \"the truck was metal\".\n2. We are also given that \"the doll was plastic\", which means P is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the truck was metal (M).\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf P, then M (given)\nP (given)\n\u2234 M (inferred)\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
