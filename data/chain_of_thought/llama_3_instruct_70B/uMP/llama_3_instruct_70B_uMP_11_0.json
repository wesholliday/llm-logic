We are given a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be represented as \"If C, then B\" where C is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n2. We are also given that \"the cake was chocolate\", which means C is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the muffins were blueberry (B).\n\nSince we know C is true, and we have a conditional statement \"If C, then B\", we can conclude that B must be true as well. This is because the conditional statement guarantees that whenever C is true, B will also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
