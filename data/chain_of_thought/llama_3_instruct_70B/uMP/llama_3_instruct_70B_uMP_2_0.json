We are given the statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Griffin \u2192 Unicorn\" (if Griffin, then Unicorn).\n2. We are also given the fact that \"the griffin was in the forest\". This means we know the antecedent (Griffin) of the conditional statement is true.\n3. Since the antecedent is true and the conditional statement is \"If Griffin, then Unicorn\", we can infer that the consequent (Unicorn) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
