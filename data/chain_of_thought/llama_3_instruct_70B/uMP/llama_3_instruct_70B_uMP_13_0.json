We are given a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue\".\n2. We are also given that the antecedent (A) is true: \"The car was red.\"\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer the consequent (B): \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf A (the car was red), then B (the truck was blue)\nA (the car was red) is true\n\u2234 B (the truck was blue) must also be true\n\nAnswer: yes",
