We are given the conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"Jeff \u2192 Amy\" (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\").\n2. We are also given that \"Jeff played basketball\". This is a fact.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know Jeff played basketball, and we have the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\", we can conclude that the condition (Jeff playing basketball) has been met.\n\nTherefore, according to the conditional statement, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
