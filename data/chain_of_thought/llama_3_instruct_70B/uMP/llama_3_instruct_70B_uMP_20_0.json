We are given a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. We are also given that the antecedent (A) is true: \"The apple was red.\"\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer the consequent (B): \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude that:\n\nIf A (the apple was red), then B (the banana was yellow)\nA (the apple was red) is true\n\u2234 B (the banana was yellow) must also be true\n\nAnswer: yes",
