We are given a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\".\n2. We are also given that \"the shirt was cotton\". This means that the condition A is true.\n3. Since the condition A is true, we can infer that B must also be true (according to the conditional statement). Therefore, we can conclude that \"the pants were denim\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
