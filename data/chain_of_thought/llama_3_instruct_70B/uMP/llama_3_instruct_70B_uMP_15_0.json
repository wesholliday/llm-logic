We are given the conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as \"Sam takes a plane \u2192 Erin takes a train\".\n2. We are also given the fact that \"Sam took a plane\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Sam took a plane, we can use the conditional statement to infer what happens with Erin. The conditional statement says that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. And we know that Sam did take a plane.\n\nTherefore, according to the conditional statement, it must be true that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
