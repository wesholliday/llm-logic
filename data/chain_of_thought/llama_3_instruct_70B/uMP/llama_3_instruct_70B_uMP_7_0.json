We are given: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race\".\n2. We are also given: \"Alex finished the race\". This means that the condition \"A\" is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Chris finished the race (C).\n4. Since the condition \"A\" is true, and we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 C\", we can apply modus ponens, which states that if A is true and A \u2192 C is true, then C must be true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Chris finished the race (C).\n\nAnswer: yes",
