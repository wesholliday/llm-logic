We are given a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. We are also given that the condition P is true: \"Joe went to the park\".\n3. Since the condition P is true, we can apply the conditional statement. If P is true, then Q must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
