We are given: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\"If A (alien visited Mars), then B (robot visited Jupiter)\"\n\n2. We are also given: \"The alien visited Mars.\"\nThis means that condition A is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter (B).\n\nSince condition A is true, and we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\", we can conclude that B must be true as well. This is because the conditional statement guarantees that whenever A is true, B will also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
