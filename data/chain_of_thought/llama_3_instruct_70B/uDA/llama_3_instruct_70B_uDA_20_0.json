            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. We are also told that \"the apple was not red\". This means that A (the apple being red) is false.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nHere's the key point: just because A (the apple being red) is false, it doesn't necessarily mean that B (the banana being yellow) is also false. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if A were true, but it says nothing about what happens when A is false.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the apple was not red doesn't provide any information about the color of the banana. We can't make any conclusions about B based on the falsity of A.\n\nAnswer: no",
