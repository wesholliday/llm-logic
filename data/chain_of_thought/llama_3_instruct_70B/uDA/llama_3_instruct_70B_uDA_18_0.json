We are given: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P means \"the doll was plastic\" and M means \"the truck was metal\".\n2. We are also given: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This means that P is false.\n3. Now, let's analyze the implication of P being false on the conditional statement \"P \u2192 M\". If P is false, then the conditional statement does not provide any information about M (the truck being metal). In other words, we cannot infer anything about M from the given conditional statement when P is false.\n\nSo, based on the provided information, we cannot conclude that the truck was not metal. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
