We know: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Sue chooses pizza \u2192 Bob chooses pasta\".\n2. We also know: \"Sue did not choose pizza\". This means the condition in the first statement is not true.\n\nNow, let's analyze what happens when the condition is not true:\n\n* If Sue didn't choose pizza, we cannot conclude anything about Bob's choice from the given conditional statement.\n* The statement only tells us what would happen if Sue chose pizza, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Sue doesn't choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta. There is simply not enough information to make a conclusion about Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
