            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\" (if Mary, then Sue).\n2. We also know that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This means that the condition \"Mary\" is false.\n3. Since the condition \"Mary\" is false, we cannot conclude anything about Sue based on the conditional statement alone. However, we can use the fact that the condition is false to make an inference.\n\nHere's the key insight: if Mary was not at the wedding, then the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not provide any information about Sue's attendance. The statement only tells us what would happen if Mary were at the wedding, but since Mary is not at the wedding, it doesn't apply.\n\nHowever, we can make a indirect inference. If Mary was not at the wedding, and the conditional statement is true, then it means that Sue's attendance is not dependent on Mary's attendance. In other words, there's no reason to believe that Sue would be at the wedding if Mary wasn't.\n\nSo, while we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that Sue was not at the wedding, the inference suggests that it's likely that Sue was not at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
