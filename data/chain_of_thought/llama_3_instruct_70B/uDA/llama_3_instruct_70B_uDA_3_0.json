            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n2. However, we are also told that \"the book was not written by James\". This means that James did not write the book.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for the genre of the book:\n\nSince James didn't write the book, the condition \"if the book was written by James\" is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book is a mystery novel based on the first statement.\n\nBut can we infer that the book is NOT a mystery novel? Not necessarily. The fact that James didn't write the book doesn't provide any information about the genre of the book. It could still be a mystery novel written by someone else, or it could be a different type of book altogether.\n\nAnswer: no",
