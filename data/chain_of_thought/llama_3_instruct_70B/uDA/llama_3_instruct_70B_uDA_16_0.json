            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C is \"the shirt was cotton\" and D is \"the pants were denim\".\n2. We are also told that \"the shirt was not cotton\". This means \u00acC (not C) is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the pants were not denim (\u00acD).\n\nFrom the given conditional statement, we know that if C were true, then D would be true. However, since C is actually false (\u00acC), we cannot conclude anything about D from this statement alone.\n\nIn other words, just because the shirt was not cotton, it does not necessarily mean the pants were not denim. There might be other reasons why the pants are or are not denim, unrelated to the shirt's material.\n\nAnswer: no",
