We are given the conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as \"Ben eats pasta \u2192 Kate eats salad\".\n2. We are also told that \"Ben did not eat pasta\". This means the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of our conditional statement is false.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nHere's the key: when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the consequent (the \"then\" part). This is because the conditional statement only guarantees something will happen if the condition is met, but it doesn't say anything about what happens when the condition isn't met.\n\nIn this case, since Ben didn't eat pasta, our conditional statement doesn't provide any information about Kate's eating habits. We can't infer that Kate did or did not eat salad based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
