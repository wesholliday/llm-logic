We are given the conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\".\n2. We are also told that \"Tom did not watch football\". This means the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze what happens when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false:\n\n* If the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (the \"then\" part). The conditional statement only guarantees something about the consequent if the antecedent is true.\n* In other words, if Tom didn't watch football, our conditional statement doesn't provide any information about whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball. We simply don't have enough information to make a conclusion about Jen's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
