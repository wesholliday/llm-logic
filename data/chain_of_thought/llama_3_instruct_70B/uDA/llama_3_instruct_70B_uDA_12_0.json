            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. We are also told that \"Joe did not go to the park\", which means ~P (not P) is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo (~Q).\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that if P were true, then Q would be true. However, since ~P is true (Joe didn't go to the park), we cannot conclude anything about Q (Lucy going to the zoo) from this conditional statement alone.\n\nIn other words, just because Joe didn't go to the park, it doesn't necessarily mean Lucy didn't go to the zoo. There might be other reasons why Lucy went or didn't go to the zoo that are unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
