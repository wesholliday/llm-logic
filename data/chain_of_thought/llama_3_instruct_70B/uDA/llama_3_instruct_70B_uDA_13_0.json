            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\".\n2. We are also told that \"the car was not red\", which means P is false.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue (i.e., Q is false).\n\nHere's the key: just because P is false, it doesn't necessarily mean Q is false. The conditional statement only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true. But in this case, P is false, so we can't make any conclusions about Q.\n\nThink of it like this: if I say \"if it's raining, then the street will be wet\", and it's not raining, we can't conclude that the street won't be wet. Maybe someone poured water on the street, or maybe there's a leaky pipe. The point is, just because the condition (rain) isn't met, we can't infer anything about the consequence (wet street).\n\nSo, in our original problem, we can't infer that the truck was not blue simply because the car wasn't red.\n\nAnswer: no",
