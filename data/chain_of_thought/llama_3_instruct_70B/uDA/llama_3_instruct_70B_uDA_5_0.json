            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\", where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n2. We are also told that \"Jeff did not play basketball\", which means \u00acJ (not J) is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Amy did not play tennis (\u00acA).\n\nFrom the given conditional statement J \u2192 A, we know that if Jeff played basketball (J), then Amy must have played tennis (A). However, since Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acJ), the conditional statement does not provide any information about Amy playing tennis.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Jeff didn't play basketball doesn't necessarily imply that Amy didn't play tennis. There might be other reasons why Amy played or didn't play tennis, which are not related to Jeff's basketball activities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
