            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Lisa buys red \u2192 Mark buys blue\".\n2. We also know: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means the condition in the first statement is not true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt is not fulfilled. However, this doesn't necessarily mean Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. There might be other reasons or conditions that led Mark to buy the blue shirt.\n\nWe can't infer with certainty that Mark did not buy the blue shirt solely based on the given information. The absence of Lisa buying the red shirt only means the specific condition mentioned in the first statement is not applicable, but it doesn't provide conclusive evidence about Mark's action.\n\nAnswer: no",
