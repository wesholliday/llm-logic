(Given)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. But from statement 2, we know that the dog is not inside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the dog is not inside, it doesn't necessarily mean the cat is not outside.\n* The first statement only tells us what happens when the dog is inside, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the dog is not inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside. We simply don't have enough information to make a conclusion about the cat's location based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
