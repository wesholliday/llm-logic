            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This implies a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n2. We are also told that \"the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the vampire is not awake, we can't conclude directly whether the mummy is awake or not based on the given information. However, we can use the contrapositive of the original conditional statement to help us.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"if A then B\" is \"if not B then not A.\" In this case:\n\n* A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n* B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive would be: \"if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nNow, we know that the vampire was indeed not awake (given in statement 2). Using the contrapositive, if the vampire was not awake, it doesn't necessarily mean the mummy was not awake. There's a possibility that the mummy could still be awake.\n\nHowever, since we're asked to infer whether the mummy was not awake, let's see if we can find any other clues or connections. Unfortunately, there aren't any additional statements provided to help us determine the mummy's state.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
