From the first statement, we know that the splat is not quanked.\n\n3. The second statement says that either the splat is morphed or it is quanked. Since we already know that the splat is not quanked (from step 2), the only other possibility left is that the splat is morphed.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
