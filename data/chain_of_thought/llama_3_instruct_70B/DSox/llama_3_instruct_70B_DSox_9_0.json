We are given two statements:\n   - \"The twonk is not plinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the twonk is not varnished, then it is plinked\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we are given that the twonk is not plinked (Statement A). This means that the condition \"the twonk is not varnished\" in Statement B would lead to a contradiction (since the twonk cannot be both not plinked and plinked at the same time).\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"the twonk is not varnished\" must be false, which means the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
