The second statement can be rewritten as:\n   - 'If the sprocket is not daggled, then it is cranked' (using the rule of inference for \"or\" statements)\n\n3. Now we can use modus ponens with the first statement and our rewritten second statement:\n   - 'The sprocket is not daggled' (given)\n   - 'If the sprocket is not daggled, then it is cranked' (rewritten from given)\n   - Therefore, 'The sprocket is cranked'\n\nAnswer: yes",
