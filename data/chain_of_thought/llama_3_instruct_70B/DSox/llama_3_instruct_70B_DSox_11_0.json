We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flug is not zimmed\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the flug is not zimmed, then it is blummed\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can combine Statement A with our rewritten Statement B:\n   - \"The flug is not zimmed\" (given)\n   - \"If the flug is not zimmed, then it is blummed\" (rewritten from given)\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude: \n   - \"The flug is blummed\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
