We are given two statements:\n   - \"The whiffle is not tinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as \"The whiffle is shanked OR the whiffle is tinked\". This is a classic example of an \"inclusive or\" statement, meaning that either one or both conditions can be true.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze Statement A: \"The whiffle is not tinked\". This tells us that the condition \"the whiffle is tinked\" is false.\n\n4. Going back to Statement B, we know that \"the whiffle is shanked OR the whiffle is tinked\" must be true (since it's a given statement). However, we just established that \"the whiffle is tinked\" is false.\n\n5. Therefore, for Statement B to remain true, the only option left is that \"the whiffle is shanked\" must be true. This is because an \"inclusive or\" statement requires at least one of the conditions to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
