We have two statements:\n   - \"The smonk is not plagged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as:\n   - \"If the smonk is not vreebled, then it is plagged\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we combine Statement A with our rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the smonk is not plagged (Statement A), and\n     if the smonk is not vreebled, then it is plagged (rewritten Statement B),\n   - then we can conclude that the smonk must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
