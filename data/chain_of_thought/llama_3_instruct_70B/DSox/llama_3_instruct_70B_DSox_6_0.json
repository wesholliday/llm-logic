We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet is not plopped\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the grommet is not sploffed, then it is plopped\" (using the rule of material implication).\n\n3. Now, we are told that the grommet is not plopped (Statement A). This means the condition \"the grommet is not sploffed\" in our rewritten Statement B cannot be true.\n\n4. Therefore, to satisfy Statement B, the other option must be true: the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
