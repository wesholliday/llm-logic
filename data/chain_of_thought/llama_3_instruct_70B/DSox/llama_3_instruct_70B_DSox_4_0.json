We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fribble is not crinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\" statements).\n\n3. Now, we combine this rewritten statement with Statement A:\n   - \"The fribble is not crinked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled\" (rewritten Statement B)\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude that:\n   - \"The fribble is snurgled\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
