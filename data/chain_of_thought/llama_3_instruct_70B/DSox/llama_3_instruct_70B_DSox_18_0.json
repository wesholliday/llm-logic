We are given two statements:\n   - \"The shank is not nugged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the shank is not nugged, then it is plooked\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can use modus ponens with Statement A and our rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the shank is not nugged (Statement A), then it is plooked (rewritten Statement B)\n   - The shank is not nugged (given in Statement A)\n   - Therefore, the shank is plooked\n\nAnswer: yes",
