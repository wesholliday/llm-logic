We are given two statements:\n   - \"The clug is not snugged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the clug is not snugged, then it is fleeked\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can combine Statement A with our rewritten Statement B:\n   - \"The clug is not snugged\" (given)\n   - \"If the clug is not snugged, then it is fleeked\" (rewritten from Statement B)\n\n4. Using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can conclude: \n   - \"The clug is fleeked\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
