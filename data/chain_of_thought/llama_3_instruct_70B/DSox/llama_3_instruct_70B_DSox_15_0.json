We are given two statements:\n   - \"The dreb is not spened\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the dreb is not vroombed, then it is spened\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we are given that the dreb is not spened (Statement A). This means that the condition \"the dreb is not vroombed\" in Statement B would lead to a contradiction.\n\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the dreb is indeed vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
