We are given two statements:\n   - \"The smip is not lupped\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"The smip is shripped OR the smip is lupped\"\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"the smip is not lupped\". This means the second part of Statement B (\"the smip is lupped\") must be false.\n\n4. Since Statement B says it's either one or the other (shripped or lupped), and we know \"lupped\" is false, then the only option left is that \"the smip is shripped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
