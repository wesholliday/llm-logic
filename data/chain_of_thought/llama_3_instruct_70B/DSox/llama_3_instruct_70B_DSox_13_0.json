We are given two statements:\n   - \"The glip is not tragged\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"The glip is slogged OR the glip is tragged\". This is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A: \"The glip is not tragged\". This tells us that the second condition in Statement B (\"the glip is tragged\") is false.\n\n4. Since Statement B says that at least one of the conditions must be true, and we know that \"the glip is tragged\" is false, then the only option left is that \"the glip is slogged\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
