From the second statement, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that the flugel is not zargled. This means we can eliminate the possibility that the flugel is zargled from our consideration.\n\n4. Since there are only two possibilities (blimmed or zargled) and we have eliminated zargled, we are left with only one option: the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
