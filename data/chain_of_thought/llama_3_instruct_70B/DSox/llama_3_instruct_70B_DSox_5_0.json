We are given two statements:\n   - \"The zinger is not smoogled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the zinger is not smoogled, then it is fraggled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can use modus ponens with Statement A and our rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the zinger is not smoogled (Statement A), then it is fraggled (rewritten Statement B)\n   - The zinger is not smoogled (given in Statement A)\n   - Therefore, the zinger is fraggled\n\nAnswer: yes",
