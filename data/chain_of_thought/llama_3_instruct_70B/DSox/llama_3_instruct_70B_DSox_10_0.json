From the first statement, we know that the wug is not garpled.\n\n3. The second statement says that either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled. Since we already know that the wug is not garpled (from step 2), this means that the only other possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that the wug is indeed sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
