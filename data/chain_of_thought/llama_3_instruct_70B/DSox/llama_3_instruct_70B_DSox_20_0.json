We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg is not surned\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the fleeg is not surned, then it is bluttered\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can use modus ponens with Statement A and our rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the fleeg is not surned (given in Statement A), then it is bluttered (from our rewritten Statement B)\n   - The fleeg is not surned (Statement A)\n   - \u2234 The fleeg is bluttered\n\nAnswer: yes",
