We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flob is not movated\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"If the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled\" (using the rule of inference for \"or\")\n\n3. Now, we can use modus ponens with Statement A and our rewritten Statement B:\n   - If the flob is not movated (given in Statement A), then it is skizzled (from our rewritten Statement B)\n   - The flob is not movated (Statement A)\n   - \u2234 The flob is skizzled\n\nAnswer: yes",
