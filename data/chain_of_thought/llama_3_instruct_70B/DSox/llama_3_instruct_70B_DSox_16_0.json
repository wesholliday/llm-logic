We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sneg is not sproted\" (Statement A)\n   - \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as: \"The sneg is crampled OR the sneg is sproted\". This is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n3. Now, let's consider Statement A: \"The sneg is not sproted\". This tells us that the second condition in Statement B (\"the sneg is sproted\") is false.\n\n4. Since Statement B says that at least one of the conditions must be true, and we know that the second condition is false, then the first condition (\"the sneg is crampled\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
