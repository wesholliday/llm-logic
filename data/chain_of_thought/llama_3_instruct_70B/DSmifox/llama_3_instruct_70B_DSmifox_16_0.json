We have two statements:\n   - \"The sneg might not be sproted\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. Statement A tells us that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n3. Statement B gives us two options: either the sneg must be sproted, or it is crampled. This means that if the sneg is not sproted (which is possible according to statement A), then it must be crampled.\n\n4. Since we know that the sneg might not be sproted (from statement A), and if it's not sproted then it must be crampled (from statement B), we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
