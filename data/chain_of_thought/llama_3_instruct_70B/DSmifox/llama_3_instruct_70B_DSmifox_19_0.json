We have two statements:\n   - \"The smonk might not be plagged\" (which implies that the smonk could be plagged or it could not be plagged)\n   - \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - The smonk must be plagged\n   - It is vreebled\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"The smonk might not be plagged\". This implies that it's possible for the smonk to not be plagged.\n\n4. If the smonk is not plagged (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be vreebled. \n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
