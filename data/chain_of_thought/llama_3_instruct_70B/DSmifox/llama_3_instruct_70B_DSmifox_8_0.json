We have two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" (which implies that the sprocket could be not daggled)\n   - \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - The sprocket must be daggled\n   - The sprocket is cranked\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"The sprocket might not be daggled\". This implies that the possibility of the sprocket being not daggled exists.\n\n4. Since we know from the second statement that there are only two possibilities (daggled or cranked), and the first statement tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled, it means that the other possibility (the sprocket is cranked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
