We are given two statements:\n   - \"The glip might not be tragged\" (which implies that it's possible the glip is not tragged)\n   - \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - The glip must be tragged\n   - It is slogged\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement: \"The glip might not be tragged\". This implies that the possibility of the glip not being tragged exists.\n\n4. Since we know from the second statement that there are only two possibilities (tragged or slogged), and the first statement tells us that it's possible the glip is not tragged, then the other possibility must be true - \"it is slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
