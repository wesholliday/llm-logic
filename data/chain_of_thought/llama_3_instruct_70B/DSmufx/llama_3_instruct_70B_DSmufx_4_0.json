This can be represented as \"Crinked \u2228 Snurgled\" (where \"\u2228\" denotes the logical OR operator).\n2. We are also given the statement \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acCrinked\" (where \"\u00ac\" denotes the logical NOT operator).\n3. From \u00acCrinked, we can infer that Crinked is false.\n4. Since Crinked is false, and we have Crinked \u2228 Snurgled, the only way for this disjunction to be true is if Snurgled is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
