This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the clug must be snugged\" and B = \"it is fleeked\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged\". This can be represented as \"not A\".\n3. From step 2, we know that A is false.\n4. Since A is false, the only way for \"A or B\" to be true is if B is true (because \"or\" is an inclusive operator).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that B (\"it is fleeked\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
