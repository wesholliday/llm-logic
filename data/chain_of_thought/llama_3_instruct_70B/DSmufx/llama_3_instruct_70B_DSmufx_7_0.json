We are given two premises:\n   a) Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\n   b) It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\n2. From premise (a), we know that there are only two possibilities: either the whiffle must be tinked, or it is shanked.\n\n3. Premise (b) tells us that the first possibility (the whiffle must be tinked) is not true.\n\n4. Since the first possibility is eliminated, and we have an \"either-or\" situation, the only remaining option is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
