This can be represented as a logical disjunction: Tragged \u2228 Slogged.\n2. We are also given the statement \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\", which can be represented as \u00acTragged (not Tragged).\n3. From the first statement, we know that either Tragged is true or Slogged is true (or both). But from the second statement, we know that Tragged is false.\n4. Since Tragged is false, and we have a disjunction (OR) between Tragged and Slogged, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if Slogged is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
