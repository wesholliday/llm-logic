This can be represented as a logical disjunction: Z \u2228 B, where Z represents \"the flug must be zimmed\" and B represents \"it is blummed\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\", which can be represented as \u00acZ.\n3. From \u00acZ, we know that Z is false.\n4. Since Z \u2228 B is true (given in step 1), and Z is false (from step 3), then B must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
