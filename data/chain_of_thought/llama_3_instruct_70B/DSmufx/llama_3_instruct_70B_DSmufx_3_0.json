This can be represented as \"Quank \u2228 Morph\" (where \"\u2228\" means \"or\").\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQuank\" (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\").\n3. From \u00acQuank, we can infer that Quank is false.\n4. Since Quank is false, and we have Quank \u2228 Morph, the only way for this statement to be true is if Morph is true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
