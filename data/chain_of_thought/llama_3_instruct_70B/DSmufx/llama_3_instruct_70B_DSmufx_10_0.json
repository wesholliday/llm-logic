This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled\". This is equivalent to saying \"The wug does not have to be garpled\".\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. Since it's an \"or\" statement, if one condition is false, the other condition must be true for the entire statement to remain true.\n\n4. We know that \"the wug must be garpled\" is false (from the second statement). Therefore, for the entire first statement to remain true, \"it is sproinged\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
