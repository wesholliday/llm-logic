This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\". This is equivalent to saying \"The fleeg does not have to be surned\".\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. We know that either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered. But we've just established that the fleeg doesn't have to be surned.\n\n4. Therefore, since the \"surned\" option is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that \"it is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
