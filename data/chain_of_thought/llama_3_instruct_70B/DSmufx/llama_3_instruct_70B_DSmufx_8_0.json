            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\". This can be represented as \"D \u2228 C\", where \"D\" means \"the sprocket must be daggled\" and \"C\" means \"the sprocket is cranked\".\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\". This can be represented as \"\u00acD\", which means \"not D\" or \"it's not true that the sprocket must be daggled\".\n3. Now, let's analyze the situation: if it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (\u00acD), then the only other option is that the sprocket is cranked (C). This is because the original statement \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" implies that these are the only two possibilities.\n4. Therefore, if \u00acD is true, then C must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
