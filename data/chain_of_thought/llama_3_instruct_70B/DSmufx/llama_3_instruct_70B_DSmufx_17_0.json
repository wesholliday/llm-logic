This can be represented as \"P \u2228 Q\", where P = \"the flob must be movated\" and Q = \"it is skizzled\".\n2. We are also given that \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n3. From \u00acP, we know that P is false.\n4. Since P \u2228 Q is true (given in statement 1), and P is false, then Q must be true to make the disjunction true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Q, \"The flob is skizzled\", is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
