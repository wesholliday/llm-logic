This can be represented as \"S \u2228 C\", where S represents \"the sneg must be sproted\" and C represents \"it is crampled\".\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\".\n3. From \u00acS, we can infer that S is false.\n4. Since S \u2228 C is true (given in statement 1), and S is false, then C must be true to make the disjunction true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
