This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the flugel must be zargled\" and B = \"it is blimmed\".\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\", which can be represented as \"not A\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that if A is false (i.e., it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled), then B must be true in order for the \"or\" statement to hold.\n4. Since we know that A is indeed false (from the second statement), we can conclude that B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
