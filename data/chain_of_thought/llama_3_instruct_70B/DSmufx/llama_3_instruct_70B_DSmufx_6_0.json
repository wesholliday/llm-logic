This can be represented as a logical disjunction: P \u2228 S, where P represents \"the grommet must be plopped\" and S represents \"the grommet is sploffed\".\n2. We are also given the statement: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\". This can be represented as a logical negation: \u00acP.\n3. From \u00acP, we know that P is false. Since P \u2228 S is true (given in step 1), and P is false, it means that S must be true to make the disjunction true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
