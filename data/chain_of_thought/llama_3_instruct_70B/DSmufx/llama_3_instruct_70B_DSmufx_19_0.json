This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\". This is equivalent to saying \"The smonk does not have to be plagged\".\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. We know that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. But we've just established that the smonk doesn't have to be plagged.\n\n4. Therefore, if the smonk doesn't have to be plagged, and one of the two options (plagged or vreebled) must be true, then the only remaining option is that \"the smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
