This can be represented as \"N \u2228 P\", where \"N\" represents \"the shank must be nugged\" and \"P\" represents \"it is plooked\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\". This can be represented as \"\u00acN\", where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n3. From \u00acN, we know that N is false.\n4. Since N \u2228 P is true (given in step 1), and N is false (from step 3), the only way for N \u2228 P to be true is if P is true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The shank is plooked\" (P) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
