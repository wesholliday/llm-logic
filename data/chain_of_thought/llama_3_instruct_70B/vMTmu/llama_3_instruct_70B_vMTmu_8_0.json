            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy must have been awake\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"not M\" or \"it's not the case that M\".\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1 (V \u2192 M), we know that if V is true, then M must also be true.\n\nFrom premise 2 (\u00acM), we know that M is false.\n\nUsing modus tollens (a valid logical rule), we can conclude that since M is false and V \u2192 M, V must also be false. This is because if V were true, it would imply M, but we know M is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \u00acV (\"The vampire was not awake\") logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
