            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P = \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q = \"Amy must have played tennis\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", which is the negation of Q.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (Jeff played basketball) is true, then Q (Amy must have played tennis) must also be true.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Q (Amy must have played tennis) is actually false (\u00acQ).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can conclude that since Q is false and P \u2192 Q, P must also be false. In other words, if Jeff playing basketball would imply Amy playing tennis, but Amy didn't play tennis, then Jeff couldn't have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (\u00acP) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
