            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", which means \"not Q\" or \"it's not the case that Q\".\n3. The conclusion is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then Q (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Q (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) is actually false. This means that the condition for P to imply Q is not met.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can conclude that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP. In this case, if \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" (P \u2192 Q) and \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" (\u00acQ), then we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
