            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck must have been metal\".\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\". This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"not M\" or \"it's not the case that M\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The doll was not plastic\". This can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P (the doll was plastic), then M (the truck must have been metal) follows.\nFrom premise 2, we know that \u00acM (it's not the case that the truck must have been metal).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can infer from premises 1 and 2 that \u00acP (the doll was not plastic).\n\nModus tollens states that if P \u2192 M and \u00acM, then \u00acP. In this case, we have exactly that: P \u2192 M (premise 1), \u00acM (premise 2), and therefore we can conclude \u00acP (the doll was not plastic).\n\nAnswer: yes",
