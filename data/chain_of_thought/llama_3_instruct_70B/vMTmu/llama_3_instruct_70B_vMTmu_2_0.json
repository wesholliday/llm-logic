            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acU\", which is the negation of U.\n3. The conclusion states: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acG\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if G is true, then U must also be true (G \u2192 U).\nFrom premise 2, we know that U is false (\u00acU).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since U is false and G implies U, G must also be false. In other words, if the unicorn wasn't in the forest, then the griffin couldn't have been in the forest either.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
