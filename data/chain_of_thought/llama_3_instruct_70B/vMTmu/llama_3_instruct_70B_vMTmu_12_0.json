            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 L\" (where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and L represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\").\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acL\" (where \u00ac denotes negation).\n3. The conclusion is: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if P is true, then L must also be true (P \u2192 L). However, premise 2 tells us that L is actually false (\u00acL).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since L is false and P implies L, P must also be false. In other words, if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then Joe couldn't have gone to the park.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" (\u00acP) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
