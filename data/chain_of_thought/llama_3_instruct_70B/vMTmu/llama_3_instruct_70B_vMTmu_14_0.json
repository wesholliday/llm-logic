            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\". This can be represented as \"B \u2192 W\", where B represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and W represents \"the wolf must have been in the den\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\". This can be represented as \"\u00acW\", which is equivalent to saying \"the wolf was not in the den\".\n3. The conclusion is: \"The bear was not in the cave\", which can be represented as \"\u00acB\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if B is true, then W must also be true (B \u2192 W).\nFrom premise 2, we know that W is false (\u00acW).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since W is false and B implies W, B must also be false. In other words, if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear cannot have been in the cave.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
