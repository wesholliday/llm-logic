            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acS\", which is equivalent to saying \"Sue was not necessarily at the wedding\".\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if M is true, then S must also be true (M \u2192 S).\nFrom premise 2, we know that S is false (\u00acS).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since S is false and M implies S, M must also be false. In other words, if Sue was not necessarily at the wedding, then Mary cannot have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
