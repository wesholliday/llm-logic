            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants must have been denim\".\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\". This can be represented as \"\u00acD\", which means \"not D\" or \"it's not true that the pants must have been denim\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The shirt was not cotton\". This can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if C is true, then D must also be true (C \u2192 D).\nFrom premise 2, we know that D is actually false (\u00acD).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can conclude that since D is false and C implies D, C must also be false. In other words, if the pants were not denim, then the shirt cannot have been cotton.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
