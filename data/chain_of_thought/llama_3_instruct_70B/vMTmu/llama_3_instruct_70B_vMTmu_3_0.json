            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"J \u2192 M\", where J represents \"the book was written by James\" and M represents \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which is the negation of M.\n3. The conclusion states: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acJ\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if J is true, then M must also be true (J \u2192 M).\nFrom premise 2, we know that M is false (\u00acM).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since M is false and J implies M, J must also be false. In other words, if it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel, and James' authorship implies that it must be a mystery novel, then James cannot be the author.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"\u00acJ\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
