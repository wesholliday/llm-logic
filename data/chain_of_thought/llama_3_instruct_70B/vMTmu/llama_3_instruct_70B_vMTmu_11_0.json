The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cake was not chocolate\" (\u223cp)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if p (the cake was chocolate) is true, then q (the muffins must have been blueberry) must also be true.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that q (the muffins must have been blueberry) is false (\u223cq).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid logical rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\n\nIn this case, if \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" (p \u2192 q) and \"it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" (\u223cq), then we can conclude \"the cake was not chocolate\" (\u223cp).\n\nAnswer: yes",
