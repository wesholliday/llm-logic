            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" (p \u2192 q)\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" (\u223cq)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Tom did not watch football\" (\u223cp)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use a simple logical rule called modus tollens:\n\nModus Tollens: If p \u2192 q and \u223cq, then \u223cp\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n* p \u2192 q (If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball)\n* \u223cq (It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\n\u223cp (Tom did not watch football)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises using a valid logical rule, this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
