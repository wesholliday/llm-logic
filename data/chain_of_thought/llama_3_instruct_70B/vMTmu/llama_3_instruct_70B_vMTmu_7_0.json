            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris must have finished the race\".\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acC\", which is the negation of C.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acA\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if A is true, then C must also be true (A \u2192 C).\nFrom premise 2, we know that C is false (\u00acC).\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that since C is false and A implies C, A must also be false. In other words, if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex cannot have finished the race either.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical structure:\n\nA \u2192 C\n\u00acC\n\u2234 \u00acA\n\nAnswer: yes",
