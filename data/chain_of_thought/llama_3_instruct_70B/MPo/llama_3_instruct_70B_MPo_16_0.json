We are given two statements: \n   - \"The shirt was cotton\" (a fact)\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the first part (\"the shirt was cotton\") is true, then the second part (\"the pants were denim\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know the first part (\"the shirt was cotton\") is indeed true from the given fact, we can conclude that the second part (\"the pants were denim\") must also be true according to the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
