We have two statements:\n   - \"The alien visited Mars\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" is true, then the consequence \"the robot visited Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the alien visited Mars\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if the alien visited Mars (which is true), then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
