We are also given a conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true (from step 1), and we have a conditional statement that says if \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true. This means that the condition in the conditional statement has been met.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
