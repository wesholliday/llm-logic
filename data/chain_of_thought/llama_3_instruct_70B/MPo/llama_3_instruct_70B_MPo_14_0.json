We have two statements:\n   - \"The bear was in the cave\" (a fact)\n   - \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the first part (\"the bear was in the cave\") is true, then the second part (\"the wolf was in the den\") must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know \"The bear was in the cave\" is true (from the first statement), we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if \"The bear was in the cave\" is true, then \"The wolf was in the den\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
