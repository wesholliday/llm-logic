We have two premises:\n   - \"The apple was red\" (a statement about the apple)\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\n3. We are given that A (\"the apple was red\") is true.\n\n4. According to the conditional statement, if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, since we know A is true, we can conclude that B (\"the banana was yellow\") is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
