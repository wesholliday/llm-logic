We are also given a conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This can be represented as \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true (from step 1), and we have a conditional statement that says if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, we can conclude that the condition for Amy playing tennis has been met.\n\nIn other words, since the antecedent (\"Jeff played basketball\") is true, we can infer that the consequent (\"Amy played tennis\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
