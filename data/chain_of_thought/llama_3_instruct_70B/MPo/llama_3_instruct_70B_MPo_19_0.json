We also have a conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". This can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know that \"Tom watched football\" is true (from statement 1), and we have a conditional statement that says if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, we can conclude that the condition for the conditional statement has been met.\n\nIn other words, since the antecedent (\"Tom watched football\") is true, we can infer that the consequent (\"Jen watched basketball\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
