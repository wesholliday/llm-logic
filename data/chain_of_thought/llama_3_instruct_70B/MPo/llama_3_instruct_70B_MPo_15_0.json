We are also given the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that P (Sam took a plane) is true.\n4. Since P is true, and we have the conditional statement P \u2192 Q, we can apply modus ponens to infer that Q (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
