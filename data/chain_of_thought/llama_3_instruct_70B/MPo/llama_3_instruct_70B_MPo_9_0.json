            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   - \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (a simple statement)\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   - P: \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n   - Q: \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n3. Since we know that P (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\") is true from the first premise, we can apply modus ponens (a logical rule) to the conditional statement.\n\n4. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know P is true, then we can infer that Q is also true.\n\n5. In this case, since we know \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (P) is true, we can conclude that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (Q) must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
