            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   - \"The car was red\" (a simple statement about the car's color)\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (a conditional statement that links the car's color to the truck's color)\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\", where:\n   - A: \"The car was red\"\n   - B: \"The truck was blue\"\n\n3. Since we know that the car was indeed red (from the first premise), we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. According to the conditional statement, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. \n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
