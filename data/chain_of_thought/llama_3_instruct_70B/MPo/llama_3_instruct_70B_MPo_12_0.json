We have two statements:\n   - \"Joe went to the park\" (a fact)\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know that \"Joe went to the park\" is indeed true (from the first statement), we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if Joe went to the park (which he did), then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
