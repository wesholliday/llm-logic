We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mary was at the wedding\" (a fact)\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is indeed true (from the first statement), we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if Mary was at the wedding (which she was), then Sue must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
