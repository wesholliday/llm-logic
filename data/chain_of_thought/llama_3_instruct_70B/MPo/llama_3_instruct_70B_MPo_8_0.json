We are also given the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that V is true (the vampire was awake).\n4. Since V is true, and we have the conditional statement V \u2192 M, we can conclude that M must also be true (by modus ponens).\n\nAnswer: yes",
