We have two premises:\n   - \"The book was written by James\" (statement about the author)\n   - \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (conditional statement)\n\n2. The second premise implies that if the condition \"the book was written by James\" is true, then the conclusion \"the book is a mystery novel\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first premise that \"the book was written by James\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the second premise, if the condition is true (which it is), then the conclusion \"the book is a mystery novel\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
