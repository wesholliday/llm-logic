The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n   If P, then Q\n   where P = 'Alex finished the race' and Q = 'Chris finished the race'\n\n3. We are also given that P is true (Alex finished the race).\n   According to the rule of modus ponens in logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must be true.\n\n4. Applying this rule to our situation, since 'Alex finished the race' (P) is true, and we have the conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', we can conclude that 'Chris finished the race' (Q) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
