We are given two statements: \n   - \"The doll was plastic\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (Conditional Statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Premise 1 that \"the doll was plastic\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if the doll was plastic (which it was), then the truck must have been metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
