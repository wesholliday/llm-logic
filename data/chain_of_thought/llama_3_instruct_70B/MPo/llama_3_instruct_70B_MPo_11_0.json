We have two statements:\n   - \"The cake was chocolate\" (a simple assertion)\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the cake was chocolate\" is true, then the consequence \"the muffins were blueberry\" must also be true.\n\n3. We know from the first statement that \"the cake was chocolate\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, we can conclude that \"the muffins were blueberry\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
