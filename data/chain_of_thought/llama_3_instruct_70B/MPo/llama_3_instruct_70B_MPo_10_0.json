We have two statements:\n   - \"The dog was inside\" (a fact)\n   - \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" (a conditional statement)\n\n2. The conditional statement implies that if the condition \"the dog was inside\" is true, then the consequence \"the cat was outside\" must also be true.\n\n3. We know from the first statement that \"the dog was inside\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, we can conclude that \"the cat was outside\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
