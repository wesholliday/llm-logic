This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n2. We also know that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This means that it's possible that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (which is a possibility), then according to statement 1, they must be in the jar. However, we can't conclude that the cookies are definitely in the jar because statement 2 only tells us that it's possible that they're not hidden in the pantry, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that they are hidden in the pantry.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no",
