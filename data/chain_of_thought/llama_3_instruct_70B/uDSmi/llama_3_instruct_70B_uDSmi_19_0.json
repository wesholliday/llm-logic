Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\nThis implies that these are the only two possible locations of the watch.\n\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist.\nThis statement does not provide any definitive information, but it suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the watch is not on his wrist (as suggested by statement 2), then according to statement 1, it must be charging on the dresser. However, we cannot conclude this with absolute certainty because statement 2 only suggests a possibility, not a definitive fact.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the watch is definitely charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
