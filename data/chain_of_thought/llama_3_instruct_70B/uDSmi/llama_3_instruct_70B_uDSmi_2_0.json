Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis implies that there are only two possible locations for the book: the shelf and the table.\n\n2. The book might not be resting on the table.\nThis statement does not provide any definitive information, but it suggests that the possibility of the book being on the table is uncertain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the book is not on the table (which is a possibility according to statement 2), then it must be on the shelf because there are only two possible locations for the book (as stated in statement 1).\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the book is on the shelf. The uncertainty in statement 2 leaves open the possibility that the book might still be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: no",
