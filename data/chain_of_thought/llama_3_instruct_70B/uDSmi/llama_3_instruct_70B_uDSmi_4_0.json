Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\nThis implies that these are the only two possible scenarios, and one of them must be true.\n\n2. The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\nThis statement doesn't provide any definitive information, but it does suggest that there's a possibility the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the cat is playing in the bedroom, then the first statement is satisfied, and we can't infer anything about the couch.\n* But if the cat is not playing in the bedroom (which is possible according to the second statement), then the only other option is that the cat must be napping on the couch, as per the first statement.\n\nSo, considering both possibilities, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
