Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement implies that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden.\n\n2. Fido might not be in the garden.\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Fido is not inside (from statement 1), then he must be in the garden. However, statement 2 says that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that if Fido is not inside, there is still a possibility that he is not in the garden.\n\nIn this case, we cannot conclude that Fido is definitely inside. There is still a possibility that Fido is not inside and also not in the garden (although it's unclear where he would be then).\n\nAnswer: no",
