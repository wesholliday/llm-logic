We know that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor (this is a classic \"either-or\" statement).\n2. We also know that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements:\n\n* If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then according to the first statement, it must be in the box.\n* But if the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, we can't conclude that it's in the box. It could still be on the floor.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, we can't infer with absolute certainty that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. There's still a possibility that it's blending in on the floor.\n\nAnswer: no",
