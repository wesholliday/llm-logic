This means that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them must be true.\n2. We also know that the pen might not be on my desk. This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the pen is not on my desk (which is possible according to statement 2), then it must be in my bag because we know that either it's in my bag or on my desk (from statement 1).\n\nSo, given the information, we can infer that if the pen is not on my desk, it must be in my bag. However, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the pen is in my bag because there is still a possibility that it might be on my desk.\n\nAnswer: no",
