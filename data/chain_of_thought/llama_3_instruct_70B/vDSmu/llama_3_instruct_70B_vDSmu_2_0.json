            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\". This can be represented as \"P \u2228 Q\", where P = \"the book is on the shelf\" and Q = \"it must be resting on the table\".\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\". This can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", which means \"not Q\" or \"it's not true that it must be resting on the table\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The book is on the shelf\", which is P.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that either P or Q (or both) is true.\nFrom premise 2, we know that Q is not true (\u00acQ).\nUsing the principle of excluded middle, if Q is not true, then P must be true. This is because the first premise says that either P or Q is true, and since Q is not true, P must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
