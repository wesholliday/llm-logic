This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\". This negates the first option, implying that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry.\n\n3. Since we know that either the cookies are in the pantry or they are in the jar (from step 1), and we've eliminated the possibility of them being in the pantry (step 2), it logically follows that the only remaining option is true: the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
