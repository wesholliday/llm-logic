It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: the puzzle piece is either blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that one of those possibilities (the puzzle piece blending in on the floor) is not true. Therefore, by process of elimination, the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
