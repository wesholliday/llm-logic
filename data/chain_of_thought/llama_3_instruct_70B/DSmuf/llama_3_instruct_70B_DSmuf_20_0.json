This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\". This negates the first option, implying that the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head.\n\n3. Since we know that either one of the two options must be true (from step 1), and we've eliminated the first option (from step 2), it logically follows that the second option must be true: \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
