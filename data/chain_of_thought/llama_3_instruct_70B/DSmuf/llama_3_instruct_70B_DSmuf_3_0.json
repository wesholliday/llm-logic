This is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\". This negates the first option, implying that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n3. Now, let's go back to the first statement. Since we know the keys can't be dangling in the cabinet (from step 2), and the \"or\" statement says one of the two options must be true, it means the only remaining option is that \"the keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
