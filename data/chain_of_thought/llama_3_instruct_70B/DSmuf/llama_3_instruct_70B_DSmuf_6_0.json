This can be represented as a logical disjunction: P \u2228 Q, where P = \"the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\" and Q = \"it is in the living room\".\n2. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\", which can be represented as \u00acP.\n3. From \u00acP, we know that P is false. Since P \u2228 Q is true (given), and P is false, then Q must be true to make the disjunction true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
