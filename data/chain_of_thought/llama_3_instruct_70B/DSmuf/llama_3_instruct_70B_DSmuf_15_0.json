This is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\". This negates the first option, implying that the shoes cannot be lined up by the door.\n\n3. Since the first option is ruled out, and we know that one of the two options must be true (from step 1), it means that the second option \"they are in the closet\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
