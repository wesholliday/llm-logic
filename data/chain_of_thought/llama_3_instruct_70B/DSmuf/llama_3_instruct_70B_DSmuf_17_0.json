            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This can be represented as a logical disjunction: A \u2228 B, where A = \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" and B = \"it is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\" This can be represented as \u00acA, which means \"not A\" or \"A is false\".\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\", which is equivalent to B.\n\n4. From the given statements, we have A \u2228 B and \u00acA. Using the rule of inference called \"disjunctive syllogism\", we can conclude that if A \u2228 B is true and \u00acA is true, then B must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given premises, we can indeed infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
