This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" and B = \"it is on the coffee table\".\n\n2. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\". This can be represented as \"not A\".\n\n3. From step 1, we know that either A or B (or both) must be true.\n\n4. But from step 2, we know that A is not true.\n\n5. Therefore, since A is not true and either A or B must be true, it must be the case that B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
