This can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"the book must be resting on the table\" and B = \"it is on the shelf\".\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\". This can be represented as \"not A\".\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The book is on the shelf\", which is equivalent to B.\n\n4. From the first statement, we know that either A or B (or both) must be true. But from the second statement, we know that A is not true. Therefore, the only option left is that B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
