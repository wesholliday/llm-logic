            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This can be represented as a logical disjunction: A \u2228 B, where A = \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" and B = \"it is on the counter\".\n\n2. The second statement says: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\". This can be represented as \u00acA, which means \"not A\" or \"A is false\".\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The milk is on the counter\", which is B.\n\n4. From the first statement, we know A \u2228 B. Using the rule of inference called \"disjunctive syllogism\", if we have A \u2228 B and \u00acA, then we can conclude B.\n\n5. In our case, we have A \u2228 B (either the milk is in the fridge or on the counter) and \u00acA (it's not in the fridge). Therefore, using disjunctive syllogism, we can infer B, which means \"The milk is on the counter\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
