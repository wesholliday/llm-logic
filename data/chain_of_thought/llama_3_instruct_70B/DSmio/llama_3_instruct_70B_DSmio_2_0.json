            "content": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The book might not be resting on the table\" (let's call this statement A)\n   - \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" (let's call this statement B)\n\n2. From statement B, we can infer that there are only two possible scenarios:\n   - The book is on the shelf\n   - The book must be resting on the table\n\n3. Now, let's analyze statement A: \"The book might not be resting on the table\". This implies that it's possible the book is not resting on the table.\n\n4. If the book is not resting on the table (as suggested by statement A), then according to statement B, the only other possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that if \"The book might not be resting on the table\" and \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\", then indeed \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
