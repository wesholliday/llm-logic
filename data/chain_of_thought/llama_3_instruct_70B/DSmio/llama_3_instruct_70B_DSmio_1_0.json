We have two premises:\n   - \"Fido might not be in the garden\" (which implies that Fido could be somewhere else)\n   - \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we know that there are only two possibilities: \n   - Fido is inside\n   - Fido must be in the garden\n\n3. The first premise tells us that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that the possibility \"Fido must be in the garden\" can be eliminated.\n\n4. Since we have eliminated one of the two possibilities, we are left with only one option: \n   - Fido is inside\n\nAnswer: yes",
