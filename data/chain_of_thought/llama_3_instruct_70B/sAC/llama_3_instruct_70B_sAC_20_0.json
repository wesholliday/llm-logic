But this doesn't necessarily mean that the apple is red.\n\nJust because the banana is yellow (statement 2), it doesn't imply that the apple must be red. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow, unrelated to the color of the apple.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We can't conclude that the antecedent (the apple being red) is true just because the consequent (the banana being yellow) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
