But this doesn't necessarily mean that Tom watched football.\n\nJust because Jen watched basketball (statement 2) doesn't guarantee that Tom watched football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We can't conclude that Tom watched football just because Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
