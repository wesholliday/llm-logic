This implies a causal relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue.\n\nNow, from statement 2, we know that the truck is indeed blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that the car was red. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue, unrelated to the car's color.\n\nIn logic, this type of argument is called \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a fallacy. Just because we know the consequence (the truck being blue) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the car being red) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
