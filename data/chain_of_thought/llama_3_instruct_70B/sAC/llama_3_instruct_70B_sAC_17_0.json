But it doesn't necessarily mean that Ben eating pasta is the only reason for Kate eating salad.\n\nNow, considering statement 2, we know that Kate indeed ate salad. However, this doesn't provide any direct evidence about whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nIn other words, just because Kate ate salad, it doesn't logically follow that Ben must have eaten pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, unrelated to Ben's eating pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
