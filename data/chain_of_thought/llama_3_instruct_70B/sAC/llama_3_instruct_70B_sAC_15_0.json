But this doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nJust because Erin took a train (statement 2), it doesn't guarantee that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam's actions.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We can't conclude that Sam took a plane just because Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
