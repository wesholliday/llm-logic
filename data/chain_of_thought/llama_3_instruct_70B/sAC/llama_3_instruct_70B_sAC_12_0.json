This implies a causal relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nNow, we are told that statement 2 is true, which means Lucy did go to the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) is true, it does not guarantee that the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
