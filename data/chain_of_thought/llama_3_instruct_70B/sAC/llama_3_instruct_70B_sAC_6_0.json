This implies a causal relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n\nNow, we are told that statement 2 is true, which means Bob indeed chose pasta.\n\nThe question is whether we can conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nWhile it is true that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta (from statement 1), the converse is not necessarily true. Just because Bob chose pasta, it does not automatically mean that Sue chose pizza. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
