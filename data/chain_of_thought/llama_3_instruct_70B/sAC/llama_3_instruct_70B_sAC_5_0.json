Now, let's examine the conditional statement (1). It says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nSince Amy did play tennis (statement 2), it seems like the consequence of the conditional statement has occurred. However, this does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is true.\n\nIn other words, just because Amy played tennis, it doesn't automatically imply that Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
