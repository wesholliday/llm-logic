This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. We are also given that \"Mary was at the wedding\", which is represented by M.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"Sue was at the wedding\" (S) from these two statements.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic, we can conclude:\n\nIf M \u2192 S (conditional statement)\nand M (Mary was at the wedding)\nthen S (Sue was at the wedding)\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"Sue was at the wedding\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
