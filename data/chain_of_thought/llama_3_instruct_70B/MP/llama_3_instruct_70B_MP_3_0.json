We have the conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if the condition \"the book was written by James\" is true, then the conclusion \"the book is a mystery novel\" must also be true.\n2. We are given the premise: \"The book was written by James.\" This satisfies the condition mentioned in step 1.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can infer that the conclusion must also be true, according to the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
