            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the bear was in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n2. We are also given that \"The bear was in the cave\", which means A is true.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The wolf was in the den\", i.e., whether B is true.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a fundamental rule of logic, we can conclude that:\n\nIf A \u2192 B (conditional statement) and A (antecedent) are both true, then B (consequent) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"the bear was in the cave\" (A) is true, and \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (A \u2192 B), we can infer that \"the wolf was in the den\" (B) is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
