This implies that if the condition \"the car was red\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck was blue\" must also be true.\n2. We are given an additional piece of information: \"The car was red\". This means the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied.\n3. Since the condition is true, we can infer that the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
