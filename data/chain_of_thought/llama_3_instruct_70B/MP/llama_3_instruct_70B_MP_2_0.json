This can be represented as \"Griffin \u2192 Unicorn\".\n2. We are also given that \"The griffin was in the forest\", which means the condition \"Griffin\" is true.\n3. Since the condition \"Griffin\" is true, and we have a conditional statement \"Griffin \u2192 Unicorn\", we can infer that the consequence \"Unicorn\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
