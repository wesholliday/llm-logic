Alex finished the race (fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris also finishes the race. This implies a causal relationship between Alex finishing and Chris finishing.\n\nNow, we are told in statement 2 that Alex indeed finished the race. Therefore, according to the conditional statement in 1, we can conclude that Chris must have finished the race as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
