This implies that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n2. We are given additional information: \"The alien visited Mars\". This means the antecedent of our conditional statement is true.\n3. Since the antecedent is true and we have a conditional statement, we can infer that the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
