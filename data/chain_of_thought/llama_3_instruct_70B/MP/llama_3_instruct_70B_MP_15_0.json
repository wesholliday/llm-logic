Sam took a plane.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is indeed true.\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens (a logical rule of inference), we can conclude that the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
