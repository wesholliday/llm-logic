Joe went to the park.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is indeed true.\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens (a logical rule of inference), we can conclude that the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
