In other words, it asserts that Mary's presence at the wedding is not a guaranteed or required fact.\n\nConclusion: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\"\nThis conclusion expresses the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion:\n\nIf it's true that Mary's presence at the wedding is not necessary (as stated in the premise), then it means that there is a possibility that she might not have been there. This is exactly what the conclusion asserts.\n\nIn other words, if we deny the necessity of Mary being at the wedding, we are implicitly acknowledging that her absence is possible. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
