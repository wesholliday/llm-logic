The premise states that it's possible for the vampire not to be awake, which implies that there is a possibility of the vampire not being awake.\n\nThe conclusion simply rephrases this idea by saying \"the vampire might not have been awake\", which means the same thing as \"it's possible that the vampire wasn't awake\".\n\nSince the premise logically leads to the conclusion, and the conclusion is a direct restatement of the premise, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
