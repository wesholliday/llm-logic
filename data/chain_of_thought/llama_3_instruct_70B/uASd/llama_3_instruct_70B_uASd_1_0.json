We know that soaking a match in water typically makes it difficult or impossible for it to light, even when struck.\n\nGiven this new information, can we still infer that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light? \n\nThe answer is no. The additional condition of being soaked in water contradicts the initial causal relationship between striking the match and it lighting up. In other words, the fact that the match has been soaked in water overrides the initial implication that striking the match would make it light.\n\nAnswer: no",
