However, this statement does not take into account other factors that might affect the lawn's health, such as weather conditions.\n\nWhen we add the condition \"and there is a drought\", we are introducing an additional factor that can impact the lawn's health. Droughts typically have a negative effect on lawns, causing them to become dry and withered.\n\nIn this scenario, fertilizing the lawn may not be enough to overcome the adverse effects of the drought. The fertilizer might provide some benefits, but it is unlikely to completely counteract the lack of water.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\n\nAnswer: no",
