This new information introduces a potential obstacle or complication that might affect my ability to pass the test, regardless of how hard I study.\n\nHowever, the original statement doesn't provide any information about my proficiency in Chinese or how it might impact my performance on the test. It only focuses on the relationship between studying hard and passing the test.\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer with certainty that if I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test. The language of the test introduces an unknown variable that could affect the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
