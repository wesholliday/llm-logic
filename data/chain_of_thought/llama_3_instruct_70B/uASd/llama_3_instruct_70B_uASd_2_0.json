In other words, attending the concert is likely to lead to a positive experience.\n\nNow, let's consider the modified scenario: \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off...\" This adds an entirely new and unrelated factor to the original situation - a bomb explosion. The presence of a bomb going off would likely have a significant impact on our experience, making it extremely unlikely that we would have a good time.\n\nIn fact, having a bomb go off during the concert would probably lead to a traumatic and potentially dangerous experience, which is the opposite of having a good time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. The addition of the bomb explosion completely changes the circumstances and makes the original conclusion no longer applicable.\n\nAnswer: no",
