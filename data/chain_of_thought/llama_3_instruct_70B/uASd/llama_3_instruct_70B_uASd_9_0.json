If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\n\nThis implies a direct causal relationship between a well-written essay and getting an A grade.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional condition: the essay is turned in late.\n\nThe original statement doesn't mention anything about the timing of the submission affecting the grade. It only focuses on the quality of the essay (being well-written).\n\nIn this scenario, we can't automatically assume that turning in a well-written essay late will guarantee an A grade. There might be other factors at play, such as penalties for late submissions or additional requirements that need to be met.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: no",
