This event is unrelated to finishing homework. It's an external circumstance that might prevent me from playing video games, regardless of whether I finished my homework or not.\n\nIn this scenario, even if I finish my homework, the fact that my computer catches on fire means I won't be able to play video games anyway. The original condition (finishing homework) is still met, but the additional circumstance (computer catching on fire) overrides the consequence (playing video games).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games.\n\nAnswer: no",
