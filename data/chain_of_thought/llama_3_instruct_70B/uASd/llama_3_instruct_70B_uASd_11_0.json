            "content": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe initial statement is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\" This implies a causal relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired. In other words, sufficient sleep is a sufficient condition to avoid feeling tired.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional factor of doing hard labor. Hard labor is typically physically demanding and can cause fatigue. Even if someone gets enough sleep, engaging in hard labor might still make them feel tired due to the physical exertion.\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. However, the initial statement only guarantees that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness in the absence of other factors. It doesn't account for additional factors like hard labor that might still cause fatigue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that getting enough sleep and doing hard labor will definitely prevent tiredness. The hard labor might still override the benefits of sufficient sleep and lead to feelings of exhaustion.\n\nAnswer: no",
