            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. The second premise is \"The apple was red\", which corresponds to A being true.\n3. The conclusion is \"The banana was yellow\", which corresponds to B.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of this argument:\n\nIf A \u2192 B (first premise)\nA (second premise)\n\u2234 B (conclusion)\n\nThis is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid inference rule in propositional logic. The rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\" and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the correct logical structure and applies the modus ponens rule correctly.\n\nAnswer: yes",
