            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n2. The second premise states: \"The vampire was awake.\" This can be represented as simply \"V\".\n3. The conclusion is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as simply \"M\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nFrom the first premise (V \u2192 M), we know that if V is true, then M must also be true.\nThe second premise tells us that V is indeed true.\nTherefore, using modus ponens (a valid inference rule), we can conclude that M must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
