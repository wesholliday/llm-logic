The second premise states: \"Alex finished the race\" (p)\n3. The conclusion is: \"Chris finished the race\" (q)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n* If the first premise is true, it means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well.\n* The second premise confirms that Alex did finish the race.\n* Therefore, according to the first premise, since Alex finished the race, we can conclude that Chris also finished the race.\n\nThis argument follows a valid logical form, known as modus ponens:\n\np \u2192 q\np\n\u2234 q\n\nWhere p is \"Alex finished the race\" and q is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
