            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n2. The second premise states: \"Mary was at the wedding\". This provides evidence that the condition mentioned in the first premise is true.\n3. The conclusion draws on this evidence to infer: \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nNow, let's examine the logical validity of this argument:\n\n* If the premises are true, can we logically conclude that the conclusion must also be true?\n* In other words, does the truth of the premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\nThe answer is yes. If Mary's presence implies Sue's presence (first premise), and Mary was indeed at the wedding (second premise), then it logically follows that Sue must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
