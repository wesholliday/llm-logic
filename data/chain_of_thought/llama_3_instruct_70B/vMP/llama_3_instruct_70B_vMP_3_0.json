            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n2. The second premise states: \"The book was written by James.\" This tells us that James indeed wrote the book.\n3. Now, we can combine the two premises to reach a conclusion. Since James wrote the book (premise 2), and if James wrote the book then it's a mystery novel (premise 1), we can logically conclude that \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid logical inference rule. It states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
