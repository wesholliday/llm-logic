            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n2. The second premise is \"Tom watched football\", which is the antecedent of the conditional statement (P).\n3. The conclusion is \"Jen watched basketball\", which is the consequent of the conditional statement (Q).\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference:\n\n* Modus Ponens: If we have a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have \"P \u2192 Q\" (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball) and we know that P is true (Tom watched football). Therefore, using Modus Ponens, we can infer that Q is also true, which is the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
