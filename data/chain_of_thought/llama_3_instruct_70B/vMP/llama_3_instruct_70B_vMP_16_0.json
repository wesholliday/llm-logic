            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\".\n2. The second premise is \"The shirt was cotton\", which is equivalent to saying \"A is true\".\n3. The conclusion is \"The pants were denim\", which is equivalent to saying \"B is true\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf A \u2192 B (first premise) and A (second premise), then we can logically conclude that B. This is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
