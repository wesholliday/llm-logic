            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n2. The second premise is \"The doll was plastic\", which is the antecedent of the conditional statement (P).\n3. The conclusion is \"The truck was metal\", which is the consequent of the conditional statement (Q).\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference:\n\n* Modus Ponens: If P \u2192 Q and P, then we can infer Q.\n\nIn this case, we have P \u2192 Q (the first premise) and P (the second premise), so we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude Q, which is \"The truck was metal\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a valid rule of inference (Modus Ponens).\n\nAnswer: yes",
