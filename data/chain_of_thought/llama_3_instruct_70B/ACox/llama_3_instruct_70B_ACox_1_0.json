From the second statement, we can see that if the flugel was blimmed, it would imply that the flugel was zargled.\n\n3. Now, we are told that 'The flugel was zargled' (first statement).\n\n4. However, just because the flugel was zargled, it doesn't necessarily mean it was blimmed. There could be other reasons why the flugel was zargled.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The flugel was blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: no",
