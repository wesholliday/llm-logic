We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat quanked\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten as an implication: \n   If P (the splat was morphed), then Q (the splat quanked)\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that Q is true (the splat quanked).\n\n4. Now, if we knew that P \u2192 Q and Q are both true, we could infer that P must be true as well (modus ponens). \n\n5. However, in this case, we only have the implication \"If P, then Q\" and the fact that Q is true, but we don't have any direct information about P.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that P (the splat was morphed) is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
