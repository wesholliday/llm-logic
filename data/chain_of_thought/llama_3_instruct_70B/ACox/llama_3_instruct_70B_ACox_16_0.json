We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet was plopped\" (P)\n   - \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped\" (S \u2192 P)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that if S is true, then P must also be true.\n\n3. However, we are not given any direct information about whether S (\"The grommet was sploffed\") is actually true or false.\n\n4. Since we don't have enough information to confirm S, we cannot infer that \"The grommet was sploffed\" (S) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
