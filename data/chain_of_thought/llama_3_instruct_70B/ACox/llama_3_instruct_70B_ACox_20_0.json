We are given two statements:\n   - \"The wug was garpled\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as:\n   - \"The wug was sproinged \u2192 The wug was garpled\"\n\n3. From Statement A, we know that \"The wug was garpled\" is true.\n\n4. Now, let's analyze the conditional statement (Statement B). If the antecedent (\"The wug was sproinged\") were true, then the consequent (\"The wug was garpled\") would also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is true.\n\n5. In other words, just because we know the consequent is true (from Statement A), it does not logically follow that the antecedent must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The wug was sproinged\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
