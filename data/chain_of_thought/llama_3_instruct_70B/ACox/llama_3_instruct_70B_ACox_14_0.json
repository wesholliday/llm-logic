We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fribble was crinked\" (statement A)\n   - \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked\" (statement B)\n\n2. Statement B can be rewritten in a more formal way as:\n   - \"The fribble was snurgled \u2192 The fribble was crinked\"\n\n3. From statement A, we know that \"The fribble was crinked\" is true.\n\n4. Now, let's examine the implication in statement B. If the antecedent (\"The fribble was snurgled\") were true, then the consequent (\"The fribble was crinked\") would also be true. However, we don't have any direct evidence that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true.\n\n5. Since we can't conclude that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: no",
