We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat was quanked\" (P)\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked\" (Q \u2192 P)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that if Q (the splat was morphed) is true, then P (the splat was quanked) must also be true.\n\n3. We are already given that P (the splat was quanked) is true.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Q (the splat was morphed) is true. There could be other reasons why the splat was quanked.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
