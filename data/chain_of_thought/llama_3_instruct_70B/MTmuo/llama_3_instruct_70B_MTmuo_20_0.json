We are also given: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" (\u2200r \u2192 \u2200y)\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If the apple was indeed red (r), then according to the second statement, the banana must have been yellow (\u2200y). But this contradicts our first statement, which says it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (\u00ac\u2200y).\n* Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"the apple was red\" (r) leads to a contradiction. This means that the assumption itself must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
