We are also given: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" (SCP \u2192 MBP)\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If SCP were true (Sue chose pizza), then according to the second statement, MBP would be true (Bob must have chosen pasta).\n* But we know that \u00acMBP is true (it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta). This means that SCP cannot be true, because if it were, MBP would be true, which contradicts \u00acMBP.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
