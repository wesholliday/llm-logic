            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This means that Lucy may or may not have gone to the zoo, but we cannot conclude for certain that she must have gone.\n2. We are also given \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n3. Now, let's consider what would happen if Joe did go to the park. In that case, according to the conditional statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n4. But we know from step 1 that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that our assumption in step 3 (Joe went to the park) leads to a contradiction.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
