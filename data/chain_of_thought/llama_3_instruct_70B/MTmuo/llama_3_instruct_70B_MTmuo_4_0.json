We are also given \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\". This is a conditional statement, and we can analyze it as follows:\n   - If the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot must have visited Jupiter) should also be true.\n   - But we know from step 1 that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Therefore, the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) cannot be true.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
