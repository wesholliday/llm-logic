We are given: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" (i.e., ~MB, where MB means \"the muffins must have been blueberry\").\n2. We are also given: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" (i.e., CC \u2192 MB, where CC means \"the cake was chocolate\").\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If CC were true (i.e., the cake was indeed chocolate), then according to the second statement, MB would also be true (i.e., the muffins must have been blueberry).\n* However, we know that ~MB is true (from the first statement). This means that if CC were true, we would have a contradiction (~MB and MB cannot both be true).\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that CC must be false. In other words, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
