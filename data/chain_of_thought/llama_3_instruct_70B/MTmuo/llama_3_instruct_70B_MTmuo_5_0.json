We are also given \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\". This implies that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy would have definitely played tennis.\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that Jeff did play basketball. If that were true, then according to statement 2, Amy must have played tennis. But this contradicts statement 1, which says it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n4. Therefore, our assumption in step 3 (that Jeff did play basketball) leads to a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption must be false, i.e., Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
