We are also given: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\" (\u2200y(Dy \u2192 Oy) \u2192 \u2200x(Cx \u2192 Ox))\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement:\n\n* If the dog was inside (Dy), then the cat must have been outside (Ox)\n* This implies that if the dog is not inside (\u00acDy), we cannot conclude that the cat must have been outside (\u00ac(Cx \u2192 Ox))\n* Since we know it's not the case that the cat must have been outside (\u00ac\u2200x(Cx \u2192 Ox)), this means the dog was not inside (\u2235\u00acDy)\n\nAnswer: yes",
