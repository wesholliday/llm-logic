We are also given \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\". This implies a conditional relationship between the vampire being awake and the mummy being awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then according to the second statement, the mummy must have been awake. But we know from the first statement that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n* This means that if the vampire was awake, we would reach a contradiction (the mummy both must and must not have been awake).\n* Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
