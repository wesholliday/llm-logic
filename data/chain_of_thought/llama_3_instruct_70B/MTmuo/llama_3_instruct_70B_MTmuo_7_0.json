This means that Chris may or may not have finished the race, but we cannot conclude for certain that he must have finished.\n2. We are also given \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\". This implies a conditional relationship between Alex finishing and Chris finishing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Alex had finished the race, then according to the second statement, Chris must have finished the race. But we know from the first statement that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n* Therefore, if Alex had finished the race, we would reach a contradiction (Chris both must and must not have finished).\n* To avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
