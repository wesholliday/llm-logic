We are also given: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" (LR \u2192 MB)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If Lisa did buy the red shirt (LR), then according to the second statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt (MB). But this contradicts the first statement, which says it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (\u00acMB).\n* Therefore, if Lisa did buy the red shirt, we would reach a contradiction.\n* This means that the assumption \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" leads to an inconsistency. Hence, we can conclude that this assumption is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
