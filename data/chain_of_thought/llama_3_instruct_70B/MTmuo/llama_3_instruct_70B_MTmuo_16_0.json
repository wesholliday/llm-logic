We are also given: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" (\u2200s(cotton) \u2192 \u2200p(denim))\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If the shirt was cotton, then according to statement 2, the pants must have been denim.\n* But statement 1 says it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, we would reach a contradiction.\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the assumption \"the shirt was cotton\" must be false. Therefore, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
