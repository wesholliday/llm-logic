We are also given: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\". This implies that if James wrote the book, it would necessarily be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if the book was written by James:\n\n* If the book was written by James, then according to statement 2, it must be a mystery novel.\n* But this contradicts statement 1, which says that the book doesn't have to be a mystery novel.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that our initial assumption - \"the book was written by James\" - must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
