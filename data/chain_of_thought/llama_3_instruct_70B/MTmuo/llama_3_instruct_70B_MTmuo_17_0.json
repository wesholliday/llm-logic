We are also given \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\". This implies that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate definitely ate salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Ben did eat pasta. If that were true, then according to statement 2, Kate must have eaten salad. But this contradicts statement 1, which says it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that Ben did eat pasta leads to a contradiction. This means we must reject the assumption, and conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
