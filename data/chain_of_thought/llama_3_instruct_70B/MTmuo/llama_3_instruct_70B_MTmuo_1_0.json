We are also given \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\". This implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue definitely was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if Mary was at the wedding:\n\n* If Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 2, Sue must have been at the wedding.\n* But this contradicts statement 1, which says that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThis means that our assumption - \"Mary was at the wedding\" - leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
