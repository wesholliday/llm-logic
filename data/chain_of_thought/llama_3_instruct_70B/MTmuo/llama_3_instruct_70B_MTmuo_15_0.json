We are also given \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\". This implies that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin would have definitely taken a train.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then according to statement 2, Erin must have taken a train. But this contradicts statement 1, which says it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n* Therefore, the assumption \"Sam took a plane\" leads to a contradiction.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane, because if he had, it would imply something that is known to be false (Erin must have taken a train).\n\nAnswer: yes",
