We are also given \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\". This implies that if the car was indeed red, then it would have necessitated the truck being blue.\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that the car was red. If that were true, then according to statement 2, the truck must have been blue. But this contradicts statement 1, which says the truck didn't necessarily have to be blue.\n4. Since we reached a contradiction by assuming the car was red, it means our initial assumption (the car being red) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
