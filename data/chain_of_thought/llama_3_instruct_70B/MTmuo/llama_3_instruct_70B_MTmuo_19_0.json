            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\", which means Jen might not have watched basketball or she definitely didn't watch basketball.\n2. We are also given \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\". This implies that if Tom did watch football, then it would be necessary for Jen to have watched basketball.\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility that Tom did watch football. If that were true, then according to statement 2, Jen must have watched basketball. But this contradicts statement 1, which says it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n4. Since we reached a contradiction assuming Tom watched football, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
