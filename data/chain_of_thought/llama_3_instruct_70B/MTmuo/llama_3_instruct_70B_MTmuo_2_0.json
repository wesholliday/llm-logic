We are given: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" (\u00ac\u2200U, where U means \"unicorn is in the forest\")\n2. We are also given: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" (\u2203G \u2192 \u2200U, where G means \"griffin is in the forest\")\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If the griffin was in the forest (G), then according to the second statement, the unicorn must have been in the forest (\u2200U).\n* But we know that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest (\u00ac\u2200U). This means that the assumption \"the griffin was in the forest\" (G) leads to a contradiction.\n* Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"the griffin was in the forest\" (G) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
