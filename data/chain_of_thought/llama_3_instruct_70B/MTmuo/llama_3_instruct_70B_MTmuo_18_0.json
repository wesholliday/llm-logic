We are also given \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\". This implies that if the doll is plastic, it would necessitate the truck being metal.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when we combine these two statements:\n\n* If the doll were plastic, the second statement says the truck must have been metal. But the first statement says it's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n* This means that if the doll were plastic, we would have a contradiction (the truck both must and must not be metal).\n* Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
