            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can represent this as: \"Shripped \u2192 Lupped\" (where \"Shripped\" means \"the smip was shripped\" and \"Lupped\" means \"the smip must have lupped the zoint\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \"\u00acLupped\" (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\")\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The smip was not shripped\", which can be represented as \"\u00acShripped\".\n6. To do this, we can use the rule of inference called modus tollens: \"If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\" (where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent)\n7. In our case, P = Shripped and Q = Lupped.\n8. Applying modus tollens, we get: \"If Shripped \u2192 Lupped and \u00acLupped, then \u00acShripped\"\n9. Since both premises are true (given), we can conclude that \u00acShripped is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
