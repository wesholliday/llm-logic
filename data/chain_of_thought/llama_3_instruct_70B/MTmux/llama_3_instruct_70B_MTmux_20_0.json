We are given the conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This can be represented as \"Bluttered \u2192 Surned\" (where \"\u2192\" denotes material implication).\n2. We are also given the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acSurned\".\n3. Our goal is to determine whether we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\", which can be represented as \"\u00acBluttered\".\n\nNow, let's apply some logical rules:\n\n* Modus Tollens: If we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\", we can infer \"\u00acA\".\n* In our case, we have \"Bluttered \u2192 Surned\" (A \u2192 B) and \"\u00acSurned\" (\u00acB).\n* Applying Modus Tollens, we can conclude that \"\u00acBluttered\" (\u00acA).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
