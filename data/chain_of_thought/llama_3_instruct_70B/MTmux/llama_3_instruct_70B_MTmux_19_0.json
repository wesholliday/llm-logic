            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can represent this as: \"V \u2192 P\" where V = \"the smonk was vreebled\" and P = \"the smonk must have plagged\"\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \"\u00acP\" where \u00ac denotes negation\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The smonk was not vreebled\" is true.\n6. This can be represented as: \"\u00acV\"\n7. To get from \u00acP to \u00acV, we can use the rule of inference called modus tollens:\n   - If V \u2192 P and \u00acP, then \u00acV\n8. Applying this rule, we can conclude that if the smonk must not have plagged (\u00acP), and vreebled implies plagged (V \u2192 P), then the smonk was not vreebled (\u00acV).\n\nAnswer: yes",
