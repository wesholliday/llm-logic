We can represent this as: Morphed \u2192 Quanked\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acQuanked\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The splat was not morphed\" is true.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\n6. If Morphed \u2192 Quanked and \u00acQuanked, then \u00acMorphed (i.e., the splat was not morphed)\n\nSo, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
