We can represent this as: Cranked \u2192 Daggled (where \u2192 denotes implication)\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. We can represent this as: \u00acDaggled (where \u00ac denotes negation)\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The sprocket was not cranked\" is true.\n6. To do this, we can use modus tollens, a logical rule that states: if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA.\n7. In our case, A = Cranked, B = Daggled, and we have \u00acB (\u00acDaggled).\n8. Applying modus tollens, we get: \u00acCranked (i.e., \"The sprocket was not cranked\")\n\nAnswer: yes",
