            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (conditional statement)\n2. We can represent this as: Crampled \u2192 Sproted (where Crampled means \"the sneg was crampled\" and Sproted means \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acSproted (where \u00ac denotes negation, meaning \"it's not the case that...\")\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from these two statements.\n6. To do this, we can use modus tollens, a logical rule of inference: If Crampled \u2192 Sproted and \u00acSproted, then \u00acCrampled (i.e., the negation of the antecedent)\n7. Applying modus tollens to our situation, we get: If Crampled \u2192 Sproted and \u00acSproted, then \u00acCrampled\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
