We can represent this as: Fraggle \u2192 Smoogle (where \"Fraggle\" means \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \"Smoogle\" means \"the zinger must have been smoogled\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acSmoogle (where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation, meaning \"it's not the case that...\")\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The zinger was not fraggled\" is true.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf Fraggle \u2192 Smoogle and \u00acSmoogle, then \u00acFraggle (i.e., \"The zinger was not fraggled\")\n\nSo, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
