We can represent this as: Blummed \u2192 Zimmed (where \u2192 denotes implication)\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. We can represent this as: \u00acZimmed (where \u00ac denotes negation)\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The flug was not blummed\" is true.\n6. To do this, we can use modus tollens, a valid inference rule:\n\t* If Blummed \u2192 Zimmed and \u00acZimmed, then \u00acBlummed\n7. Applying modus tollens, we get: \u00acBlummed (i.e., \"The flug was not blummed\")\n\nAnswer: yes",
