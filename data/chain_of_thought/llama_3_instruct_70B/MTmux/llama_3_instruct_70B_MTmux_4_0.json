We can represent this as: Snurgled \u2192 Crinked\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acCrinked\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer: \"The fribble was not snurgled\" (negation of the antecedent)\n6. Representing this as: \u00acSnurgled\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid argument form, we can conclude:\n\nIf Snurgled \u2192 Crinked and \u00acCrinked, then \u00acSnurgled\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
