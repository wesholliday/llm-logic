We are given two premises:\n   - If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint (P \u2192 Q)\n   - It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint (~Q)\n\n2. From the second premise, we know that Q is false.\n\n3. Now, let's examine the first premise: If P (the wug was flooped), then Q (the wug must have bimmed the zoint). Since we know Q is false, and this implication states that if P is true, then Q must be true, it means that P cannot be true. Otherwise, it would imply Q being true, which contradicts our knowledge.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that P (the wug was flooped) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
