We can represent this as: Shanked \u2192 Tinked (where \"Shanked\" means \"the whiffle was shanked\" and \"Tinked\" means \"the whiffle must have tinked\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acTinked (where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation, meaning \"it's not the case that...\")\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The whiffle was not shanked\" is true.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\n6. If Shanked \u2192 Tinked and \u00acTinked, then \u00acShanked (i.e., if the antecedent implies the consequent, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false)\n\nSo, in this case, we can indeed infer: \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
