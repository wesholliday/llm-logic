We can represent this as: S \u2192 T (where S = \"the glip was slogged\" and T = \"the glip must have tragged\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acT\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" (\u00acS)\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf S \u2192 T and \u00acT, then \u00acS\n\nIn our case, this means:\nIf the glip was slogged (S) implies the glip must have tragged (T), and it's not the case that the glip must have tragged (\u00acT), then it's not the case that the glip was slogged (\u00acS).\n\nAnswer: yes",
