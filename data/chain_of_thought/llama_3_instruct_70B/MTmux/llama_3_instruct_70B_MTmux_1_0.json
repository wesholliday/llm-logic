We can represent this as: Blimmed \u2192 Zargled (where \"\u2192\" means \"implies\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. We can represent this as: \u00acZargled (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\")\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from these two statements.\n6. To do so, we can use modus tollens, a logical rule that states: If A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA.\n7. In our case, A = Blimmed and B = Zargled. So, if Blimmed \u2192 Zargled (given) and \u00acZargled (given), then we can conclude \u00acBlimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
