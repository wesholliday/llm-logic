We can represent this as: P \u2192 N (where P = \"the shank was plooked\" and N = \"the shank must have been nugged\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acN (not N, or \"it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\")\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\", which is \u00acP.\n6. Using modus tollens (a valid inference rule), we can conclude: If P \u2192 N and \u00acN, then \u00acP.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
