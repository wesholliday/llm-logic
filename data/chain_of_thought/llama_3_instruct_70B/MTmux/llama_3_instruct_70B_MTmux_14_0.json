We are also given: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\" (negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the antecedent (\"the clug was fleeked\") is true, then the consequent (\"the clug must have been snugged\") must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the consequent (\"the clug must have been snugged\") is actually false. This means that the antecedent (\"the clug was fleeked\") cannot be true, because if it were, then the consequent would be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the antecedent (\"the clug was fleeked\") must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
