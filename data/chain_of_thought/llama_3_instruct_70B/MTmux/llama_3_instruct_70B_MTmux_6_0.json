We can represent this as: Sploffed \u2192 PloppedFrink (where \"Sploffed\" means \"the grommet was sploffed\" and \"PloppedFrink\" means \"the grommet must have plopped the frink\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. We can represent this as: \u00acPloppedFrink (where \"\u00ac\" means \"not\")\n\nNow, we want to infer whether \"The grommet was not sploffed\" is true.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf Sploffed \u2192 PloppedFrink and \u00acPloppedFrink, then \u00acSploffed\n\nIn other words, if the grommet being sploffed implies that it must have plopped the frink, but it's not the case that it plopped the frink, then we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
