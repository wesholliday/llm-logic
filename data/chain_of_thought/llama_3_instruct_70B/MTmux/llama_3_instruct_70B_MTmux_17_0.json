We can represent this as: Sk \u2192 M (where Sk = \"the flob was skizzled\" and M = \"the flob must have movated\")\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \u00acM (not M, or \"it's not the case that the flob must have movated\")\n5. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" (\u00acSk)\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf Sk \u2192 M and \u00acM, then \u00acSk\n\nIn other words, if the flob being skizzled implies that it must have movated, and it's not the case that it must have movated, then it cannot be the case that the flob was skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
