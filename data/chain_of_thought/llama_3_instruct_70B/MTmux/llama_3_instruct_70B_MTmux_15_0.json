We can represent this as: \"V \u2192 S\" where V = \"the dreb was vroombed\" and S = \"the dreb must have been spened\"\n3. We are also given: \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened\" (negation of the consequent)\n4. This can be represented as: \"\u00acS\" where \u00ac denotes negation\n5. Now, we want to infer whether \"The dreb was not vroombed\" is true or false.\n6. This can be represented as: \"\u00acV\"\n7. To infer \u00acV, we can use the rule of inference called modus tollens:\n   - If V \u2192 S and \u00acS, then \u00acV\n8. In our case, we have V \u2192 S (given) and \u00acS (given), so we can apply modus tollens to conclude \u00acV.\n\nAnswer: yes",
