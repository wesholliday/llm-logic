This implies that there's a possibility that the room was tidied, but not thoroughly.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if the room was tidied thoroughly (q), then it was not tidied (\u00acp). However, this doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nIn fact, the premise and conclusion are contrapositives of each other. The premise says \"if p, then not q\", while the conclusion says \"if q, then not p\". While these statements are related, they don't logically entail each other.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
