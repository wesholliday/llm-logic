This implies that if directions were explained clearly (Q), it's possible that they were not provided (\u00acP).\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if directions were explained clearly (Q), then directions were not provided (\u00acP). This is consistent with our inference from the premise.\n\nIn fact, we can see that the conclusion is simply a contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of \"If P, then \u00acQ\" is \"If Q, then \u00acP\", which is exactly the form of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
