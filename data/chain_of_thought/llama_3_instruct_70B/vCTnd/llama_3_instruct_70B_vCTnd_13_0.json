This implies that exercising and exercising much are mutually exclusive events.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if Alex exercised much (Q), then he didn't exercise (\u00acP). However, this doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise only tells us that exercising and exercising much are mutually exclusive, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Alex exercises much. The conclusion is making an additional assumption that isn't justified by the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
