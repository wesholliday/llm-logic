This implies that if the job was completed well (q), it cannot be the case that the job was completed (p).\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if the job was completed well (q), then it was not completed (\u00acp). This is exactly what we inferred from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does follow logically from the premise. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
