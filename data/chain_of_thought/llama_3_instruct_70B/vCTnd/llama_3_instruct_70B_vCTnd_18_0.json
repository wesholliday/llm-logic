This implies that if the issue was discussed in depth (q), then it must not have been discussed (\u00acp).\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: If the issue was discussed in depth (q), then it was not discussed (\u00acp). This conclusion is actually a contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of \"if p, then \u00acq\" is indeed \"if q, then \u00acp\".\n\nSince the conclusion is a valid contrapositive of the premise, we can conclude that this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
