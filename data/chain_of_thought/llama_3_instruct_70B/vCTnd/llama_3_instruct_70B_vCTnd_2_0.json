This means that exercising and exercising strenuously are mutually exclusive in this context.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. This conclusion is essentially saying that exercising strenuously implies not exercising at all.\n\nHowever, this conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only tells us that if Ann exercised, she didn't exercise strenuously, but it doesn't imply that exercising strenuously means she didn't exercise at all. There's a possibility that Ann could have exercised strenuously and still exercised.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
