            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently (p \u2192 \u00acq)\nConclusion: If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study (q \u2192 \u00acp)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nFrom the premise, we know that if Ben studied (p), then he didn't study diligently (\u00acq). This implies that studying and studying diligently are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion. It states that if Ben studied diligently (q), then he didn't study (\u00acp). But this is equivalent to saying that studying diligently implies not studying, which is exactly what the premise suggests.\n\nIn other words, the conclusion is simply a contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of \"if p, then \u00acq\" is indeed \"if q, then \u00acp\". Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
