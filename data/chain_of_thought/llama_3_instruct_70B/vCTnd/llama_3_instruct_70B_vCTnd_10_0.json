Now, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n\"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\"\n\nThis statement is saying that if the advice offered is helpful, then no advice was offered at all. But wait, this seems to contradict our premise! If advice was offered (regardless of whether it's helpful or not), then according to the premise, it must be unhelpful.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially saying that if helpful advice exists, then there is no advice at all. This doesn't logically follow from the premise. In fact, it seems to be a contradictory statement.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this form of argument is NOT logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
