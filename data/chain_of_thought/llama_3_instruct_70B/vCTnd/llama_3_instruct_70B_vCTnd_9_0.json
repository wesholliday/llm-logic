            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\nConclusion: If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that if instructions were given, it implies that they were not explained clearly. This can be represented as:\n\nGiven \u2192 \u00acClearly\n\nWhere \"Given\" represents the instructions being given, and \"\u00acClearly\" represents the instructions not being explained clearly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\nIf instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\nThis can be represented as:\n\nClearly \u2192 \u00acGiven\n\nHere, \"Clearly\" represents the instructions being explained clearly, and \"\u00acGiven\" represents the instructions not being given.\n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion have a similar structure. The premise states that if instructions are given, they are not clear, while the conclusion states that if instructions are clear, they were not given.\n\nThis argument is an example of a logical fallacy called \"contraposition.\" Contraposition is a valid inference rule in logic, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" we can infer \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" can be contrapositively inferred to \"If instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given,\" which is the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
