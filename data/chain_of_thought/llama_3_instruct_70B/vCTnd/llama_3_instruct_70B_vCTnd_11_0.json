            "content": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise: If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\nThis can be represented as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = \"I went to the store\" and Q = \"I bought vegetables\")\n\nConclusion: If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\nThis can be represented as: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument. The premise states that if I went to the store, then I didn't buy vegetables. This implies that going to the store and buying vegetables are mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. In other words, it's saying that if I bought vegetables, then I must not have gone to the store. This is a logically equivalent statement to the premise.\n\nIn fact, this argument form is an instance of a valid logical rule called \"contraposition\". It states that if P \u2192 \u00acQ, then Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
