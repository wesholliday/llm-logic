The phrase \"and include references\" is additional information that is not directly inferable from the original statement alone. While it's possible that the online application could include references, we cannot logically conclude this based solely on the given information. To infer that references are included, we would need additional context or information explicitly stating or strongly implying the inclusion of references in the online application.\n\nAnswer: no"
