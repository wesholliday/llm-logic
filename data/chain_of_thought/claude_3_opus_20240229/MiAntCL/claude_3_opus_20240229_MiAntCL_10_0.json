However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the document will also be notarized.\n\nNotarization is a separate process from signing, where a notary public officially verifies the identity of the person signing the document and witnesses the signature. The original statement does not mention anything about notarization.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The document might be signed and notarized\" based solely on the given statement, \"The document might be signed.\" The possibility of the document being signed does not necessarily imply that it will also be notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
