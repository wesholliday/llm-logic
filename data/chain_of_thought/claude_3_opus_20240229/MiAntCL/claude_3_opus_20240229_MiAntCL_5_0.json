            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today\" indicates that there is a possibility that the package will arrive today, but it is not certain. This statement does not provide any information about whether the package will be signed for upon delivery.\n\nSigning for a package is a separate action from the package being delivered. A package can be delivered without requiring a signature, left at the door for example. Alternatively, a signature may be required as proof of receipt, but this is not always the case.\n\nThe given statement does not imply anything about signing for the package. We cannot logically infer or assume that the package will be signed for just because it might be delivered today. More information would be needed to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
