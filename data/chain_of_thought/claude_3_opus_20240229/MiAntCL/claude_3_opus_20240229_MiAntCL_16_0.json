It does not mention anything about fresh towels. While it's possible that a room that is cleaned daily could also have fresh towels, this is not necessarily the case. The given statement does not provide enough information to make that inference with certainty. Just because the room might be cleaned daily does not automatically mean it will also have fresh towels.\n\nAnswer: no"
