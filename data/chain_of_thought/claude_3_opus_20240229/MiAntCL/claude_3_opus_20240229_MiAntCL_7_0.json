It only suggests that the exam may be challenging. The additional claim \"and cover all chapters\" is not supported by the original statement. We cannot infer or assume that the exam will cover all chapters based solely on the information that it might be difficult. The difficulty level and the content coverage are two separate aspects of an exam, and one does not necessarily imply the other without further evidence.\n\nAnswer: no"
