The first statement says: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. \n   This can be logically represented as: Lisa buying red shirt \u2192 Mark buying blue shirt\n\n2. The second statement says: Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. \n   This means there's a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n4. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then according to the first statement, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt. \n   However, the second statement only says that Mark MIGHT not have bought the blue shirt, not that he definitely did not buy it.\n\n5. So, there's still a possibility that Mark did buy the blue shirt, in which case Lisa could have bought the red shirt.\n\n6. Since there's a possibility that Lisa bought the red shirt, we cannot definitively say that she did not buy it.\n\nAnswer: no"
