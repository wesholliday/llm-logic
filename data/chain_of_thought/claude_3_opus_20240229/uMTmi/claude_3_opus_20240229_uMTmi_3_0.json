But (2) says it might not be a mystery. \n\n5) If it's not a mystery, then according to (1), James could not have written it. \n\n6) However, (2) only says it MIGHT not be a mystery. It doesn't say for certain that it ISN'T a mystery.\n\n7) If the book IS a mystery after all, then it's still possible that James wrote it, according to (1).\n\n8) Since we don't know for sure whether or not it's a mystery, we can't definitively say James didn't write it.\n\nAnswer: no"
