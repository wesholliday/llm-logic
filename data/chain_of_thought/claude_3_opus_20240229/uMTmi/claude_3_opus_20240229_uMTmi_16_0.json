But statement 2 says the pants might not have been denim.\n\n5) If the pants were not denim, then according to statement 1, the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\n6) However, the word \"might\" in statement 2 introduces uncertainty. The pants might not have been denim, but they also might have been denim. We don't know for sure.\n\n7) Because of this uncertainty, we cannot definitively say that the shirt was not cotton. The shirt could have been cotton if the pants were actually denim, despite the possibility introduced in statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no"
