In other words, it's not certain that the robot visited Jupiter. We can represent this as:\n   Possibly \u00acR\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars. In other words, can we conclude \u00acA?\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that if A is true, then R must be true. But the second statement tells us that R might not be true. \n\n5) However, this doesn't necessarily mean that A is false. The first statement only tells us what happens if A is true, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if R is false.\n\n6) In other words, the fact that R might be false doesn't allow us to conclude anything definite about A. A could be true or false, we can't be sure.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no"
