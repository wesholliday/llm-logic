            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. \n   This means that a red car necessarily implies a blue truck. \n   In logical terms, this is: Red Car \u2192 Blue Truck\n\n2) The second statement says: The truck might not have been blue. \n   This means there's a possibility that the truck was not blue. \n   In logical terms, this is: Possibly (Not Blue Truck)\n\n3) Now, we're asked if we can infer that the car was not red. \n   To infer this, we would need to show that a blue truck is necessary for a red car.\n   In other words, we would need to show: Blue Truck \u2192 Red Car\n\n4) However, the first statement only tells us that a red car implies a blue truck, not the other way around. \n   The truck not being blue doesn't necessarily mean the car wasn't red. \n   The car could be red or not red, independent of the truck's color.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
