            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. \n   In logical terms, this is equivalent to: doll is plastic \u2192 truck is metal\n\n2) The second statement says: The truck might not have been metal.\n   Logically, this means there's a possibility that: truck is not metal\n\n3) Now, we want to determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\n4) If the truck is not metal, then according to the first statement (which is an implication), we cannot say anything definite about the doll. The doll could be plastic or not plastic.\n\n5) The second statement only says that the truck might not be metal, it doesn't say definitively that the truck is not metal.\n\n6) So, while there's a possibility that the truck is not metal, and in that case we can't say anything about the doll, we don't know for certain that the truck is not metal.\n\n7) Therefore, we do not have enough information to definitively say that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
