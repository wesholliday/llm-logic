Let's represent this as:\n   Possibly, Lucy did not go to zoo\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that if Joe went to the park, then definitely Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n5) But the second statement says it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n6) If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then according to the first statement, Joe could not have gone to the park.\n\n7) However, the second statement only says that it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. It doesn't say for certain that she didn't go.\n\n8) So while it's possible that Joe did not go to the park (if Lucy indeed did not go to the zoo), we can't say for certain that he didn't go.\n\nAnswer: no"
