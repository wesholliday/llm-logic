            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. \n   In logical terms, this is equivalent to: red apple \u2192 yellow banana\n\n2) The second statement says: The banana might not have been yellow.\n   This means there's a possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n   In logical terms, this is equivalent to: possibly (not yellow banana)\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\n4) From statement 1, we know that a red apple necessarily implies a yellow banana. \n   But statement 2 says that the banana might not have been yellow.\n\n5) If the banana was not yellow, then according to statement 1, the apple could not have been red.\n\n6) However, the word \"might\" in statement 2 introduces uncertainty. It's not definitively stating that the banana was not yellow, only that it's a possibility.\n\n7) Therefore, we can't say for certain that the apple was not red. The apple could have been red if the banana was indeed yellow, despite the possibility of it not being yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"
