Because if Jeff had played basketball, Amy would definitely have played tennis (but she might not have).\n\n5) However, the second statement doesn't say for certain that Amy did not play tennis, only that she might not have. So there's still a possibility that she did play tennis.\n\n6) If Amy did play tennis, then we can't say anything for certain about whether Jeff played basketball or not. He might have, or he might not have.\n\n7) Since there's a possibility that Amy played tennis, and in that case we can't be sure about Jeff, we cannot definitively infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
