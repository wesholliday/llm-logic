It doesn't say for certain that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n7) Therefore, we can't say for sure that the griffin was not in the forest. The griffin could or could not have been in the forest, depending on whether the unicorn was actually in the forest or not, which we don't know for certain.\n\nAnswer: no"
