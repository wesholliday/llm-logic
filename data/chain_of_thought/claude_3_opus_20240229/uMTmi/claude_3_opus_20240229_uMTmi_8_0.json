Let's represent this as: possibly (mummy not awake)\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that the vampire was not awake. \n\n4) From statement 1, we know that if the vampire was awake, the mummy must have been awake. \n   But statement 2 says that it's possible the mummy was not awake. \n\n5) If the mummy was not awake, then according to statement 1, the vampire could not have been awake. \n\n6) However, statement 2 only says that the mummy might not have been awake, not that it definitely wasn't awake. \n\n7) So while it's possible that the vampire was not awake (if the mummy wasn't), we can't say for certain. \n   The vampire could have been awake if the mummy was awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
