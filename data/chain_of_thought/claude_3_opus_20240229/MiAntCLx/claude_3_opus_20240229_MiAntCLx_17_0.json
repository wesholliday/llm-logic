The original statement only tells us that the blimp might be zooble, but it does not say anything about the blimp being blurble by froodle. Without additional context or information linking zooble, blurble, and froodle, we cannot logically make the inference that the blimp has those additional properties just because it might be zooble.\n\nAnswer: no"
