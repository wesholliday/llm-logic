It states that if a certain condition is met (the smonk was vreebled), then a certain consequence follows (the smonk plagged).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the smonk was indeed vreebled.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we also have the affirmation of the antecedent (P), then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\n5) In this case, \n   - P is \"the smonk was vreebled\"\n   - Q is \"the smonk plagged\"\n\n6) We have the conditional (if P then Q) from the first statement, and we have the affirmation of P from the second statement. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer Q, which is \"the smonk plagged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
