It states that if the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" is true, then the consequence \"the whiffle tinked\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly affirms the condition of the first statement. It states that \"the whiffle was shanked\" is indeed true.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition of that statement is also true, then the consequence must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" is also given as true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"the whiffle tinked\" must be true.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that \"the whiffle tinked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
