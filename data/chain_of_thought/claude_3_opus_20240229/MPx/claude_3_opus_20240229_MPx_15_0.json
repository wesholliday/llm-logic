In logic, this is equivalent to saying \"vroombed dreb \u2192 spened dreb\".\n\n2) We are also given the statement: \"The dreb was vroombed\". This is equivalent to saying \"the dreb was vroombed is true\".\n\n3) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and we also know that the antecedent (p) is true, then we can infer that the consequent (q) must also be true.\n\n4) In this case, the conditional statement is \"vroombed dreb \u2192 spened dreb\" and we know that \"vroombed dreb\" is true.\n\n5) Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer that \"spened dreb\" must also be true.\n\n6) In other words, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb was spened\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
