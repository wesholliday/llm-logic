            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n   - \"The splat was morphed\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if a certain condition is met (the splat being morphed), then a certain consequence follows (the splat quanking).\n\n3) The second statement affirms that the condition in the first statement is indeed met - the splat was in fact morphed.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called \"modus ponens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying modus ponens here:\n   - The conditional \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"The splat was morphed\" is also affirmed to be true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"The splat quanked\" must be true as well.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that \"The splat quanked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
