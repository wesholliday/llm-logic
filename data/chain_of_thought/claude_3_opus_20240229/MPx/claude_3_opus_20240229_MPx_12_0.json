If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n2. The smip was shripped.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the smip was shripped\" is true, then the consequence \"the smip lupped the zoint\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the condition in the first statement, \"the smip was shripped,\" is indeed true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement and we affirm the antecedent (the \"if\" part), we can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part). This is known as the modus ponens rule of inference.\n\nTherefore, since we have a conditional statement (1) and the affirmation of its antecedent (2), we can infer the consequent, which is 'The smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
