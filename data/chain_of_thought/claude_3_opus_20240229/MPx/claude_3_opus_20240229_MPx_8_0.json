            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step using basic logic principles:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n   - \"The sprocket was cranked\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true, then it necessarily follows that \"the sprocket was daggled\" is also true.\n\n3) The second statement directly asserts that \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true.\n\n4) Now, if we have a conditional statement, and we also know that the condition (the \"if\" part) is true, then we can infer that the consequence (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\n5) Applying this to our statements:\n   - We know \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" (given)\n   - We also know \"The sprocket was cranked\" (given)\n   - Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\" must be true.\n\nThis type of logical inference is known as \"modus ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
