It states that if a certain condition is met (the shank being plooked), then a certain consequence follows (the shank being nugged).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the shank was indeed plooked.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we also have the affirmation of the antecedent (P), then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - P: \"the shank was plooked\"\n   - Q: \"the shank was nugged\"\n   - We have \"if P then Q\" from the first statement, and we have \"P\" from the second statement.\n   - Therefore, we can infer \"Q\", which is \"the shank was nugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
