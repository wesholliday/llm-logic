It states that if a certain condition is met (the clug was fleeked), then a certain consequence follows (the clug snugged).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" is indeed true.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we also have the affirmation of the antecedent (P), then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - P is \"the clug was fleeked\"\n   - Q is \"the clug snugged\"\n   - We have \"if P then Q\" from the first statement\n   - We have \"P\" from the second statement\n   - Therefore, we can infer \"Q\", which is \"the clug snugged\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
