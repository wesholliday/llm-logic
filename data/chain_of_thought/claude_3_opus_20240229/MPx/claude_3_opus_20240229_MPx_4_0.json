It states that if a certain condition is met (the fribble being snurgled), then a certain consequence follows (the fribble crinking).\n\n3) The second statement affirms that the condition in the first statement is indeed met - the fribble was snurgled.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a conditional statement, and we also have the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of that conditional statement being true, then we can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens here:\n   - The conditional statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\"\n   - The antecedent \"The fribble was snurgled\" is given as true.\n   - Therefore, we can infer the consequent: \"The fribble crinked\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
