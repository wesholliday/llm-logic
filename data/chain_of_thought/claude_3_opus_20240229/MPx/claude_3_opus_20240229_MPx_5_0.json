In logic, this is equivalent to saying \"the zinger being fraggled implies the zinger was smoogled\". \n\n2) We are also given the statement: \"The zinger was fraggled\". \n\n3) From 1), we know that the zinger being fraggled is sufficient to conclude the zinger was smoogled.\n\n4) From 2), we know the zinger was indeed fraggled.\n\n5) Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger was smoogled. This is a valid inference that follows the logical rule of modus ponens - if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
