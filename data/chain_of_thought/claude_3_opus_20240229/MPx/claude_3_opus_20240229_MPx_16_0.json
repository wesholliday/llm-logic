It states that if a certain condition is met (the sneg being crampled), then a certain consequence follows (the sneg sproting the frink).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the sneg was indeed crampled.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we also have the affirmation of the antecedent (P), then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\n5) In this case, P is \"the sneg was crampled\", and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink\". \n\n6) We have a conditional statement (the first statement), and we have the affirmation of the antecedent (the second statement). Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer the consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
