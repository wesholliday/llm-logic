It states that if the condition \"the flugel was blimmed\" is true, then the consequence \"the flugel was zargled\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly asserts that the condition in the first statement, \"the flugel was blimmed\", is indeed true.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we also know that the condition P is true, then we can infer that the consequence Q must be true.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - P is \"the flugel was blimmed\"\n   - Q is \"the flugel was zargled\"\n   - We know \"if P then Q\" is true from the first statement\n   - We know P is true from the second statement\n   - Therefore, we can infer that Q, \"the flugel was zargled\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
