This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated\".\n\n2) We are also given the statement \"The flob was skizzled\". This matches the condition P in the conditional statement.\n\n3) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is true, and the condition P is also true, then we can infer that Q must be true.\n\n4) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is our conditional \"If P then Q\"\n   - \"The flob was skizzled\" affirms that condition P is true\n   Therefore, we can infer that Q, \"The flob movated\", must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
