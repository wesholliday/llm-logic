            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\n2) We are asked if we can infer \"If Q, then not P\" from this. In other words, can we swap P and Q and negate both of them?\n\n3) This is actually a valid inference in logic. It's known as the contrapositive. \n\n4) The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". It's always true that a statement implies its contrapositive.\n\n5) In this case, \"not Q\" is \"the sprocket was not daggled\" and \"not P\" is \"the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\n6) So \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n7) But the question asks about \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\", which is just the negation of the contrapositive.\n\n8) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
