This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) So, the contrapositive of \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\" would be \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\n5) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. If a statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
