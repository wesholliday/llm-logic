The contrapositive of (1) would be:\n   \"If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged\".\n\n7) Statement (2) is actually the inverse of statement (1). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer statement (2) from statement (1).\n\nAnswer: no"
