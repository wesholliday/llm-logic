This is asking if the converse of the original statement is true.\n\n3) In general, the converse of a statement is not always true. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) However, in this specific case, the converse is actually true. If we assume \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" is true, then it must also be true that \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n5) This is because if the whiffle tink, and we assume the original statement is true, then it could not have been shanked, otherwise it would not have tink according to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
