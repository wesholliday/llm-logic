This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) In our case, the original statement is \"If P, then not Q\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If not (not Q), then not P\", which simplifies to \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the original statement. This is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
