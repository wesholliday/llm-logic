This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. That means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\", we can indeed infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
