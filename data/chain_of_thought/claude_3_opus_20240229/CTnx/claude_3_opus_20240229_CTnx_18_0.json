In other words, can we swap P and Q and negate both of them?\n\n3) This is actually a valid inference in logic. It's known as the contrapositive. \n\n4) The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n5) In our case, the original statement is \"If P, then not Q\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
