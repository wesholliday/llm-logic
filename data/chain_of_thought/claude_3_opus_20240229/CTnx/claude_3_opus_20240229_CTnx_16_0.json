This is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3) In propositional logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) Therefore, from the original statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\", we can indeed infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
