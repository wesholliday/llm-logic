This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) However, the original statement is \"If P, then not Q\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from the original statement. This is a direct application of the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes"
