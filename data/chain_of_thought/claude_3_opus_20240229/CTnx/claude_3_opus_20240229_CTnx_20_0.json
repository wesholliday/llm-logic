The contrapositive of statement (1) would be: \n   \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\n7) This is exactly the same as statement (2).\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer statement (2) from statement (1), because statement (2) is the contrapositive of statement (1), and the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
