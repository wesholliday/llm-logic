This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) So, the contrapositive of the original statement would be:\n   \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\"\n\n5) This is exactly the statement that the question is asking about.\n\n6) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
