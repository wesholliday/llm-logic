These are called converse statements, and they are not always both true.\n\n4) However, \"If P, then not Q\" IS logically equivalent to \"If Q, then not P\". These are called contrapositive statements, and they are always both true.\n\n5) Since the original statement is of the form \"If P, then not Q\", and we are asked if we can infer the contrapositive \"If Q, then not P\", the answer is yes, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
