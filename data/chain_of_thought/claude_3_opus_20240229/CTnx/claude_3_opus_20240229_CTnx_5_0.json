This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) So, the contrapositive of \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" would be \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\n5) Since a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
