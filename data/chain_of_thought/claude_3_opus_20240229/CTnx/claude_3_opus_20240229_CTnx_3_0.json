Let's call \"the splat was morphed\" as proposition p, and \"the splat did not quank\" as proposition q.\n\n3) So, the given statement can be written as: If p, then q, or in symbolic form, p \u2192 q.\n\n4) Now, the question is asking if we can infer \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement.\n\n5) Let's call \"the splat quank\" as proposition ~q (because it's the opposite of q), and \"the splat was not morphed\" as proposition ~p (because it's the opposite of p).\n\n6) So, the statement we're trying to infer can be written as: If ~q, then ~p, or in symbolic form, ~q \u2192 ~p.\n\n7) In propositional logic, there's a rule called the contrapositive. It states that a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"If ~q, then ~p\".\n\n8) Applying this rule to our problem, we can see that the statement we're trying to infer (~q \u2192 ~p) is indeed the contrapositive of the given statement (p \u2192 q).\n\n9) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
