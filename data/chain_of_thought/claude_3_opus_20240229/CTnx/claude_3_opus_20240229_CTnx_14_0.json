This is equivalent to asking if the converse of the original statement is true.\n\n3) In general, the converse of a statement is not always true. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) However, in this specific case, the converse is actually logically equivalent to the original statement. This is because the original statement \"If P, then not Q\" is equivalent to \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n5) We can see this equivalence by considering the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\", and a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
