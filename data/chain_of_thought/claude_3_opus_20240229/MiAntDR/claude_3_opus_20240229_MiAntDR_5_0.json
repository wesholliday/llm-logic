            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically:\n1) The original statement says the package might be delivered either today or tomorrow. This means there are two possible outcomes: delivery today, or delivery tomorrow.\n\n2) When we say \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\", we are focusing on only one of those two possible outcomes. \n\n3) If the original statement is true (i.e., the package indeed might come either today or tomorrow), then it logically follows that the package might come tomorrow. Saying it might come tomorrow doesn't exclude the possibility of it coming today; it just focuses on the \"tomorrow\" possibility which is explicitly included in the original statement.\n\n4) Therefore, if the package might be delivered today or tomorrow, then it is necessarily true that the package might be delivered tomorrow. The second statement follows logically from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
