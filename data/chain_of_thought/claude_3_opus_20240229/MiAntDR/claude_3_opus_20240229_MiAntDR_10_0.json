            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" presents two possibilities: the document being signed, or the document being notarized. These possibilities are connected by the word \"or,\" which indicates that either one or both of the possibilities could be true.\n\nIn logic, the \"or\" operator (also known as disjunction) is inclusive, meaning that if we have a statement \"A or B,\" it is true if A is true, B is true, or both A and B are true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The document might be notarized\" because it is one of the possibilities presented. The original statement allows for the document to be signed, notarized, or both, so it is valid to consider the possibility of the document being notarized independently.\n\nAnswer: yes"
