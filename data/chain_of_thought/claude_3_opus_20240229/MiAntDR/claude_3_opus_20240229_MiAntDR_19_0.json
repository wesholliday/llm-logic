The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are two distinct options, and either one of them could be true.\n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The application might be completed in person\", it is directly stated as one of the possibilities in the original statement. Since the original statement allows for the application to be completed in person, we can logically infer that \"The application might be completed in person\" is true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes"
