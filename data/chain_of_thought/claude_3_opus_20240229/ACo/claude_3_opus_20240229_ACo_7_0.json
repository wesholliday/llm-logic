It states that if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, then the consequence \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we are told directly that \"Chris finished the race\". This matches the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) Just because the consequence is true, we cannot infer that the condition must also be true. The conditional statement does not say \"Chris finished the race only if Alex finished the race\".\n\n5) For example, consider this similar argument:\n   - \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\"\n   - \"The ground is wet\"\n   Therefore, \"It is raining\"\n   \n   This is fallacious reasoning. The ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler system. Similarly, Chris could have finished the race regardless of whether Alex finished or not.\n\n6) Therefore, we do not have enough information to infer that \"Alex finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: no"
