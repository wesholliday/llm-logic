            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the first statement directly tells us that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\n4) Just because the consequence of a conditional statement is true, we cannot infer that the condition must also be true. This is a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\n5) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". Now, if we observe that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it must be raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler or a burst pipe.\n\n6) Similarly, in our problem, just because \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, we cannot conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true. Mark could have bought the blue shirt regardless of Lisa's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
