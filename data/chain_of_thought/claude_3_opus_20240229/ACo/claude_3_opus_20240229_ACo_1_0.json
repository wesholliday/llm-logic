            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not imply the reverse - that is, it does not mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding too.\n\n4) We are told directly that \"Sue was at the wedding\". This satisfies the consequence of the conditional statement, but it does not necessarily mean that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" must be true.\n\n5) Mary could have been at the wedding, but she also might not have been. The information we have is not sufficient to determine whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Mary was at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: no"
