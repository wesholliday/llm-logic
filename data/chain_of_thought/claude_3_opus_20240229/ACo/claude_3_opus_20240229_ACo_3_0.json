It states that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain consequence follows (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n3) However, just because the consequence is true (which we know from the first statement), it doesn't necessarily mean that the condition is true. \n\n4) In other words, the book being a mystery novel is a necessary consequence of James writing it, but it's not a sufficient condition. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\n5) So, while it's possible that James wrote the book, we can't infer that with certainty from the given statements. The book could have been written by James, but it also could have been written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: no"
