'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'\n\nThe second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'Joe went to the park' is true, then the consequence 'Lucy went to the zoo' must also be true.\n\nHowever, we are given that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true. This matches the consequence of the conditional statement, but it does not necessarily mean that the condition 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement does not imply that 'Joe went to the park' is the only possible reason for 'Lucy went to the zoo'. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, independent of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'Joe went to the park' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
