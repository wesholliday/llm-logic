We are also given the conditional statement: 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'. \n   This means that blumming the flug is sufficient to cause the flug to be zimmed.\n\n3. However, the converse is not necessarily true. That is, just because the flug was zimmed does not necessarily mean that the flug was blummed. There could be other ways for the flug to become zimmed besides blumming it.\n\n4. The given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that blumming is the only way to zim the flug. \n\n5. Therefore, while it's possible the flug was blummed, we cannot logically infer that it must have been, since there may be other unstated ways to zim the flug.\n\nAnswer: no"
