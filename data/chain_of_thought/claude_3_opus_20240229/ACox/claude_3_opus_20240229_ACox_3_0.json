The first statement tells us that the splat definitely quanked. \n\n3. The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It says that IF the splat was morphed, THEN it would quank. But it doesn't tell us whether or not the splat was actually morphed.\n\n4. Just because the splat quanked, we can't automatically conclude that it was morphed. There could be other reasons why it quanked besides being morphed.\n\n5. The conditional statement would allow us to conclude \"the splat was morphed\" if we knew the converse: \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed.\" But we aren't given that.\n\n6. Therefore, we don't have enough information to infer that the splat was definitely morphed. It might have been, but we can't say for sure based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
