            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, it does not state anything about what happens if \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. The conditional statement does not imply that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" can only be true if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\n4) In other words, the conditional statement does not exclude the possibility that Mark could have bought the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n5) The second statement tells us that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is indeed true.\n\n6) But given only these two pieces of information, we cannot logically conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\". It's possible that she did, but it's also possible that she didn't, and Mark bought the blue shirt for some other reason.\n\n7) To conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", we would need the converse of the given conditional statement, i.e., \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\". But this is not given to us.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no"
