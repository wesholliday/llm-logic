            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The truck was metal\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, this does not mean that the reverse is necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequence \"the truck was metal\" is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" must also be true.\n\n4) The truck being metal could be a consequence of the doll being plastic, but the truck being metal could also be true independently of whether the doll was plastic or not.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the doll was definitely plastic. The doll could have been plastic, but it also might not have been. We simply don't have enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
