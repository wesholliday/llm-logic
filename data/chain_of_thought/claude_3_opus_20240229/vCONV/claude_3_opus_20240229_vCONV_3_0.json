Just because Q follows from P, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is the only condition that could lead to Q.\n\n3) For the argument to be valid, the premise would need to be \"If and only if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This would establish a biconditional relationship where the truth of P necessarily implies the truth of Q and vice versa.\n\n4) But the given premise only states \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This leaves open the possibility that the book could be a mystery novel even if it wasn't written by James. Maybe John or Jane also write mystery novels.\n\n5) Therefore, the given argument is not logically valid. It commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent by invalidly concluding \"If Q, then P\" from the premise \"If P, then Q\".\n\nAnswer: no"
