Just because Q follows from P, it doesn't necessarily mean that P follows from Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with an example:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   Conclusion: If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\n\n4) The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a spilled drink.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original argument, just because the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn was in the forest, it doesn't necessarily mean that the unicorn being in the forest implies the griffin was there. The unicorn could have been in the forest without the griffin.\n\n6) Therefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
