The converse of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If Q then P\".\n\n3) However, the converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n4) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. But its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler).\n\n5) So, concluding the converse of a statement from the statement itself is not a logically valid move.\n\n6) Therefore, this form of argument, concluding \"If Q then P\" from the premise \"If P then Q\", is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
