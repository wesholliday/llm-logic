The converse of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If Q then P\".\n\n3) However, the converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n4) For example, the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true. But its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n5) Similarly, just because the premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, that does not necessarily mean its converse \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" is true. Jen could have watched basketball for reasons unrelated to whether Tom watched football.\n\n6) In general, an argument that tries to conclude the converse of its premise is committing the fallacy of affirming the consequent, and is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the given form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
