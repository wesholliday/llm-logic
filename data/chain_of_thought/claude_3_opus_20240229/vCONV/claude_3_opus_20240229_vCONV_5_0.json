Just because Q follows from P, it doesn't necessarily mean that P follows from Q.\n\n3) To see why, let's consider an example:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   Conclusion: If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\n\n4) The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a spilled drink.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original argument, just because Amy playing tennis follows from Jeff playing basketball, it doesn't necessarily mean that Jeff playing basketball follows from Amy playing tennis. Amy could have played tennis for another reason.\n\n6) Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
