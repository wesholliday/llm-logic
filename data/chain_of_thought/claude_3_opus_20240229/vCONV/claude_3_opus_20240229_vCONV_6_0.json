The converse of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If Q then P\".\n\n3) However, the converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n4) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. But its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler).\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot conclude the converse from the original statement alone. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
