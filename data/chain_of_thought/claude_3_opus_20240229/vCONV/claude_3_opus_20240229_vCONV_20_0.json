The converse of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If Q then P\".\n\n3) However, the converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, \"If P then Q\" does not necessarily imply \"If Q then P\".\n\n4) For example, the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler).\n\n5) Therefore, an argument that concludes the converse of its premise is not a logically valid form of argument. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
