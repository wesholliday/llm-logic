            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with a concrete example:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   Conclusion: If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n\n4) The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose. Rain isn't the only thing that can make the ground wet.\n\n5) Similarly, just because Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence, that doesn't necessarily mean that Mary's absence implies Sue's absence. Sue could have gone to the wedding without Mary.\n\n6) For the argument to be valid, the premise would need to be \"If and only if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This would make the converse also true.\n\nTherefore, the given form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
