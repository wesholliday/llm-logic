Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with a counterexample:\n   Premise: If it is a dog, then it is a mammal. \n   Conclusion: If it is not a dog, then it is not a mammal.\n   The conclusion is clearly false, because there are many mammals that are not dogs, like cats, whales, humans, etc.\n\n4) Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
