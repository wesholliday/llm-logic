            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the shirt wasn't cotton (not P), that doesn't necessarily mean the pants weren't denim (not Q).\n\n3) To see why, consider this analogous argument:\n   Premise: If it is a dog, then it is a mammal. \n   Conclusion: If it is not a dog, then it is not a mammal.\n   \n   The conclusion is clearly false, because there are many mammals that aren't dogs, like cats, whales, humans, etc. So denying the \"if\" part (the antecedent) doesn't mean you can deny the \"then\" part (the consequent).\n\n4) For the argument to be valid, the premise would need to be \"If and only if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" Then you could validly conclude \"If the shirt was not cotton, the pants were not denim.\" But that's not the premise given.\n\n5) Therefore, the argument is not logically valid in the form it is presented.\n\nAnswer: no"
