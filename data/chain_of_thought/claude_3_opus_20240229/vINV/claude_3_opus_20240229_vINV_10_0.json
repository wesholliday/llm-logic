Just because the premise says \"If P then Q\", that doesn't necessarily mean \"If not P then not Q\".\n\n3) For example, let's say the premise is true and the dog was indeed inside, so the cat was outside. \n\n4) But if the dog was not inside, that doesn't necessarily mean the cat was not outside. The cat could still be outside for some other reason, even if the dog is not inside.\n\n5) So the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
