            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with a counterexample. Consider:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet. \n   Conclusion: If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n\n4) The conclusion doesn't follow, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose. Rain is sufficient for the ground to be wet, but it's not necessary.\n\n5) Similarly, just because chocolate cake implies blueberry muffins in the premise, that doesn't mean that non-chocolate cake necessarily implies non-blueberry muffins. The muffins could be blueberry regardless of the cake flavor.\n\nTherefore, the argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
