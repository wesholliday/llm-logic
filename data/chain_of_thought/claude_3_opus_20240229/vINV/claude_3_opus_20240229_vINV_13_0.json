            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with an example:\n   Premise: If it is a dog, then it is a mammal. \n   Conclusion: If it is not a dog, then it is not a mammal.\n\n4) The conclusion is clearly false, because there are many mammals that are not dogs, like cats, whales, humans, etc. \n\n5) So denying the antecedent (the \"if\" part) does not allow us to deny the consequent (the \"then\" part). The argument form is invalid.\n\n6) Applying this back to the original argument:\n   Premise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   Conclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\n7) The truck could still be blue even if the car is not red. The color of the truck is not necessarily dependent on the color of the car in this way. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
