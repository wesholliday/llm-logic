            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with an example:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   By the logic of the argument, the conclusion would be: \n   If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n\n4) But this conclusion is clearly false, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose. The ground being wet doesn't depend solely on rain.\n\n5) Similarly, just because Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball, that doesn't mean Jen watching basketball depends solely on Tom watching football. Jen could watch basketball for other reasons even if Tom doesn't watch football.\n\n6) Therefore, the argument is invalid - the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
