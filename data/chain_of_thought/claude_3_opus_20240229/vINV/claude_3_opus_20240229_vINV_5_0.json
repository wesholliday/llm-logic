            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with an example:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   By the logic of the argument, the conclusion would be: \n   If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n\n4) But this conclusion is clearly false, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose. The ground being wet doesn't depend solely on rain.\n\n5) Similarly, just because Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis, that doesn't mean that Jeff not playing basketball necessarily implies Amy not playing tennis. Amy could play tennis for reasons independent of whether Jeff plays basketball or not.\n\n6) Therefore, the argument is invalid - the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
