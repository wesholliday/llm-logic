Maybe the unicorn just likes forests.\n\n6) So even if the griffin was not in the forest, we can't validly conclude that the unicorn wasn't in the forest. The unicorn's presence could be independent of the griffin's.\n\n7) Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
