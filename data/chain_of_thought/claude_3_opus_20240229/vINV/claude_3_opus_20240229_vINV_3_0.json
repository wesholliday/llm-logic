Just because the book being written by James is sufficient for it to be a mystery novel, that doesn't mean it's necessary. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\n3) For the argument to be valid, the premise would need to be \"If and only if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\" This would make the converse also true: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\"\n\n4) But the given premise doesn't state that, it only states the one direction. So we can't validly conclude the converse.\n\n5) A counterexample makes this clear: \n   Premise: If it is a dog, then it is a mammal. \n   Invalid Conclusion: If it is not a dog, then it is not a mammal.\n   The conclusion is obviously false (cats are mammals but not dogs), even though the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
