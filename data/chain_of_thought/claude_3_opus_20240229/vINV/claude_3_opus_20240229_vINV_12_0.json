Just because P implies Q, that doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with a concrete example:\n   Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet. \n   Conclusion: If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n\n4) The conclusion doesn't follow, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose. Rain isn't the only thing that makes the ground wet.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original argument, just because Joe going to the park implies Lucy going to the zoo, that doesn't mean that Joe not going to the park necessarily implies Lucy not going to the zoo. Lucy might go to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. It commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no"
