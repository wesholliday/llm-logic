            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2) This is actually the logical form known as \"denying the antecedent\". \n\n3) The general form is:\n   If P then Q.\n   Not P.\n   Therefore, not Q.\n\n4) However, this form of argument is a logical fallacy and is not valid. \n\n5) Just because the premise \"If P then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"If not P then not Q\" is true.\n\n6) For example, consider:\n   If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (True)\n   It is not raining. (Could be True)\n   Therefore, the ground is not wet. (Could be False, the ground could be wet for another reason)\n\n7) The only way the conclusion would be guaranteed to be true is if the premise was an \"if and only if\" statement, i.e., \"P if and only if Q\". But that's not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the given form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
