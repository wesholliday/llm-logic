The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3) In classical logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if the premise \"If P, then Q\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\" must also be true.\n\n4) In this argument, the conclusion \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race\" is the contrapositive of the premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\".\n\n5) Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
