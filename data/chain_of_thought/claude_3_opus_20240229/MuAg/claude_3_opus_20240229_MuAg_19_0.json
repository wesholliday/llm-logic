            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references\" contains two requirements that are connected by the word \"and\":\n1. The application must have been completed online.\n2. The application must have included references.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" also contains these two requirements connected by \"and\". The only difference is that the word \"must\" is not repeated before the second requirement in the inference.\n\nHowever, the meaning of the inference is the same as the original statement. The use of \"and\" in both cases implies that both requirements must be met. The repetition of \"must\" in the original statement is for emphasis, but it does not change the logical meaning of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" from the original statement without changing its meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
