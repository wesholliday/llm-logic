The car must be in the garage\n2. The car must need repairs\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer \"The car must be in the garage and need repairs\" from the given statement. The only difference between the given statement and the proposed inference is the removal of the word \"it\" and the second \"must\".\n\nIn propositional logic, when two propositions are connected by the conjunction \"and\", both propositions must be true for the entire statement to be true. The removal of the word \"it\" does not change the meaning of the second part of the statement, as \"it\" refers to the car, which is the subject of both parts.\n\nThe removal of the second \"must\" also does not change the logical meaning of the statement. \"Must\" is used to express necessity or obligation, and it applies to both parts of the statement independently. Therefore, removing the second \"must\" does not alter the logical structure or the truth value of the statement.\n\nSince the proposed inference maintains the same logical structure and meaning as the given statement, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
