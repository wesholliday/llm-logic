            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The document must have been signed\n2. The document must have been notarized\n\nThe use of \"and\" implies that both conditions must be satisfied. In other words, for the statement to be true, the document must have been both signed and notarized.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\" This statement also consists of two parts connected by \"and\":\n1. The document must have been signed\n2. The document must have been notarized\n\nThe meaning of this statement is essentially the same as the first one. It asserts that the document must satisfy both conditions of being signed and being notarized.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one without changing the meaning or losing any information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
