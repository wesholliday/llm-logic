            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The exam must have been difficult and it must have covered all chapters\" contains two assertions connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The exam must have been difficult.\n2. The exam must have covered all chapters.\n\nThe phrase \"must have\" in both parts of the statement indicates a strong belief or certainty about the exam's difficulty and coverage.\n\nIn the proposed inference \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters,\" the phrase \"must have\" is only used once at the beginning of the sentence. This single usage of \"must have\" applies to both the difficulty and coverage of the exam.\n\nThe meaning of the proposed inference is essentially the same as the original statement. The only difference is the omission of the second \"must have,\" which does not change the overall meaning or certainty of the statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" from the original statement without changing its meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
