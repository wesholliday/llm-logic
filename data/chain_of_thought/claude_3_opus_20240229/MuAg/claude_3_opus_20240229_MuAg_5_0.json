            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for\" consists of two parts:\n1. The package must have been delivered today.\n2. The package must have been signed for.\n\nThese two parts are connected by the conjunction \"and,\" which means both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" combines the two parts into a single clause. However, the meaning remains the same as the original statement. The word \"it\" in the original statement refers to \"the package,\" so removing \"it\" and directly stating \"the package\" does not change the meaning.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" logically follows from the original statement and maintains the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
