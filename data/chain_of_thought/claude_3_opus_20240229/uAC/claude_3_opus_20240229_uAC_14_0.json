It states that if the bear being in the cave is true, then the wolf being in the den must also be true. However, it doesn't say anything about the reverse - it doesn't state that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the wolf was indeed in the den. \n\n4) However, just because the wolf was in the den doesn't necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave. The bear could have been elsewhere, and the wolf could have been in the den for a different reason.\n\n5) The only way we could infer that the bear was definitely in the cave is if we were given the converse of the first statement - that is, if we were told \"if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\" But we weren't told that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no"
