The first statement is a conditional: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the result \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if Amy played tennis.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Amy played tennis.\" This matches the result of the conditional statement.\n\n3. However, just because the result of a conditional statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the condition must also be true. In other words, there could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, aside from Jeff playing basketball.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer from the given statements that Jeff definitely played basketball. Amy playing tennis could be a result of Jeff playing basketball, but it could also be due to other reasons not mentioned.\n\nAnswer: no"
