            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" We can represent this as:\n   Doll is plastic \u2192 Truck is metal\n\n2) The second statement tells us: \"The truck was metal.\" \n\n3) We are asked if we can infer that the doll was plastic.\n\n4) From the conditional statement alone, we cannot infer the doll was plastic. The conditional only tells us that if the doll was plastic, the truck must be metal. But it doesn't say anything about the reverse - the truck being metal doesn't necessarily mean the doll was plastic.\n\n5) The truck being metal is consistent with the conditional statement, but it doesn't prove the doll was plastic. The doll could have been made of a different material, and the truck could still be metal.\n\n6) To infer the doll was plastic, we would need the converse of the given conditional to also be true: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" But we are not given this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
