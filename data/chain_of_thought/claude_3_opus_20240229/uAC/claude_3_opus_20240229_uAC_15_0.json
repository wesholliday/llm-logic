If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Erin took a train.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true. However, it does not say anything about what happens if Erin took a train.\n\nThe second statement tells us that \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n- If Sam took a plane, then according to the first statement, Erin must have taken a train, which aligns with the second statement.\n- However, if Sam did not take a plane, the first statement doesn't give us any information about whether Erin took a train or not. In this case, Erin could have still taken a train, as stated in the second statement, regardless of Sam's actions.\n\nTherefore, while the statements are consistent with the scenario where Sam took a plane, they do not necessarily imply that Sam took a plane. Erin taking a train could be independent of Sam's actions.\n\nAnswer: no"
