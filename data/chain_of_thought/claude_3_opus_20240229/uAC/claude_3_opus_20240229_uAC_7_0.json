This is because the original conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, not what happens if Q is true.\n\n5) For example, consider this scenario: perhaps Chris finished the race, but Alex did not even participate in the race. In this case, both given statements would be true (because the first one doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex doesn't finish the race), but \"Alex finished the race\" would be false.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer from the given statements that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
