Sue could have been at the wedding even if Mary wasn't.\n\n2) The second statement tells us that \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This satisfies the consequent of the conditional statement (the \"then\" part).\n\n3) However, just because the consequent is true, we cannot infer that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is also true. This is because the conditional statement doesn't exclude the possibility of Sue being at the wedding without Mary.\n\n4) In other words, the information given is not sufficient to determine whether Mary was at the wedding or not. Sue's presence at the wedding could have been independent of Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
