Let's call \"the alien visited Mars\" proposition p, and \"the robot visited Jupiter\" proposition q. So, the statement can be written as: p \u2192 q\n\n2. \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" This is a direct statement that proposition q is true.\n\nNow, we have:\n- p \u2192 q\n- q\n\nThe question is, can we infer p (the alien visited Mars) from these statements?\n\nThe answer is no. This is a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because the robot visited Jupiter (q is true), it doesn't necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars (p is true). There could be other reasons for the robot to visit Jupiter.\n\nFor example, consider this similar argument:\n- If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n- The ground is wet.\nTherefore, it's raining.\n\nThis is invalid because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler or a burst water main.\n\nIn summary, we cannot infer p from p \u2192 q and q.\n\nAnswer: no"
