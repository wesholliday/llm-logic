            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   - The mummy was awake.\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional: If P (vampire awake), then Q (mummy awake). In logic, this is written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that Q is true (the mummy was awake).\n\n4) Now, we are asked if we can infer that P is true (the vampire was awake).\n\n5) This is a question of whether the argument is valid. In other words, do the premises (the given statements) necessarily lead to the conclusion (the vampire was awake)?\n\n6) In logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and Q, we cannot necessarily conclude P. This is because there could be other reasons for Q to be true, apart from P.\n\n7) For example, maybe the mummy was awake because it was daytime, not because the vampire was awake. The conditional statement only tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must be awake, but not the other way around.\n\n8) Therefore, we cannot infer from these statements alone that the vampire was awake. The mummy being awake does not necessarily mean the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
