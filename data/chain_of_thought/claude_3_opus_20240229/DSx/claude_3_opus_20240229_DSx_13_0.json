It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the glip is slogged, or the glip is tragged.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It says that the glip is not tragged.\n\n4) If we know that one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other possibility must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know that \"the glip is tragged\" is false. Therefore, for the disjunction to be true, \"the glip is slogged\" must be true.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the glip is slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
