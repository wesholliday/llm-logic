It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the flob is skizzled, or the flob is movated, or both.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It says that the flob is not movated.\n\n4) If the flob is not movated, then for the first statement to be true, the other possibility must be true: the flob must be skizzled.\n\n5) This is because if the flob was neither skizzled nor movated, the first statement would be false, but we are assuming both statements are true.\n\n6) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
