It says that at least one of two possibilities must be true: either the smonk is vreebled, or the smonk is plagged.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of those possibilities. It says the smonk is not plagged.\n\n4) If we know that one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other possibility must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know \"the smonk is plagged\" is false. Therefore, for the disjunction to be true, \"the smonk is vreebled\" must be true.\n\n6) So yes, from these two statements, we can infer that \"the smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
