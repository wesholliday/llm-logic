It says that one of two things must be true: either the fribble is snurgled, or the fribble is crinked.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of the two possibilities in the disjunction. It says the fribble is not crinked.\n\n4) If we know that a disjunction is true, and we also know that one of the disjuncts is false, then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know \"the fribble is snurgled or the fribble is crinked\" is true, and we also know \"the fribble is crinked\" is false. Therefore, \"the fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
