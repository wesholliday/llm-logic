It states that one of these two must be true.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n4) So, if the sneg is not sproted, and we know that it must be either crampled or sproted, then the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
