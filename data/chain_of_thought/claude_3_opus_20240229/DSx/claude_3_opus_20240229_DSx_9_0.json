It states that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the twonk is plinked, or the twonk is varnished, or both.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It states that the twonk is not plinked.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n   - We know that either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished (from statement 1).\n   - We also know that the twonk is not plinked (from statement 2).\n   - Therefore, since one of the two possibilities in statement 1 must be true, and we know that \"plinked\" is not true, then the other possibility, \"varnished\", must be true.\n\n5) So, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
