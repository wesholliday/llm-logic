It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the fleeg is bluttered, or the fleeg is surned. It could be both, but it must be at least one.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities is not true: the fleeg is not surned.\n\n4) If the fleeg is not surned, and we know that either it is bluttered or surned, then it must be bluttered. There's no other option.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
