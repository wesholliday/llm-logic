It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the shank is plooked, or the shank is nugged, or both.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It says that the shank is not nugged.\n\n4) If the shank is not nugged, then for the first statement to be true, the other possibility must be true: the shank must be plooked.\n\n5) This is an application of the logical rule called \"disjunctive syllogism\" or \"process of elimination\". If we have \"A or B\", and we know that B is not true, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
