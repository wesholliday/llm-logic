It says that one of two things must be true: either the whiffle is shanked, or the whiffle is tinked.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of the two possibilities in the disjunction. It says that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n4) If we know that the whiffle is not tinked, then according to the disjunction, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
