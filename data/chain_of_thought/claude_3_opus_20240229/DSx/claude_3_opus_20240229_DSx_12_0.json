It states that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the smip is shripped, or the smip is lupped.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It states that the smip is not lupped.\n\n4) If we know that the smip is not lupped, then in order for the first statement to be true, the other possibility must be true: the smip must be shripped.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
