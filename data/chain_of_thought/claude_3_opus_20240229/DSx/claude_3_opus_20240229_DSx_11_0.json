These are presented as the only two possibilities, and they are mutually exclusive (it can't be both).\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. We are told that the flug is not zimmed.\n\n4) So, if the flug is not zimmed, and the only other possibility presented is that it is blummed, then we can indeed infer that the flug must be blummed.\n\n5) This is a valid inference based on the information provided. If we assume the initial statements are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: yes"
