It says that one of two possibilities must be true: either the clug is fleeked, or the clug is snugged.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It says that the clug is not snugged.\n\n4) If we know that one part of a disjunction is false, then the other part must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know \"the clug is snugged\" is false. Therefore, for the disjunction to be true, \"the clug is fleeked\" must be true.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the clug is fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
