These are presented as the only two possibilities, and they are mutually exclusive (it can't be both).\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. We are told that the dreb is not spened.\n\n4) So, if the dreb is not spened, and being spened and being vroombed were the only two possibilities, then the dreb must be vroombed.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
