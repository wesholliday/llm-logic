It states that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the splat is morphed, or the splat is quanked, or both.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It states that the splat is not quanked.\n\n4) If the splat is not quanked, then for the first statement to be true, the other possibility must be true: the splat must be morphed.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
