It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the wug is sproinged, or the wug is garpled, or both.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It says that the wug is not garpled.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n   - We know that either the wug is sproinged or garpled (from statement 1).\n   - We also know that the wug is not garpled (from statement 2).\n   - Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\n5) This is a valid inference. If we assume that both of the given statements are true, then we can indeed conclude that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
