It can't be both, and it must be one or the other.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those two possibilities is not true: the sprocket is not daggled. \n\n4) So if we know the sprocket must be either cranked or daggled, and we also know it is not daggled, then the only remaining possibility is that it must be cranked.\n\n5) Therefore, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
