It says that one of two possibilities must be true: either the grommet is sploffed, or the grommet is plopped.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of those possibilities. It says the grommet is not plopped.\n\n4) If we know that one of two possibilities must be true (the grommet is either sploffed or plopped), and we also know that one of those possibilities is not true (the grommet is not plopped), then we can infer that the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
