            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement.\n\n3) In propositional logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to the contrapositive statement \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) However, the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is not equivalent to the original statement. It is actually the inverse of the original statement.\n\n5) The inverse of a statement is not always true when the original statement is true. For example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". The inverse of this statement, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler).\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from the original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\".\n\nAnswer: no"
