This is a true statement. However, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\" is not necessarily true, because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler system.\n\n5) Similarly, in the given problem, just because we know that \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\", we can't conclude that \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\". The fribble might crink for other reasons, even if it wasn't snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make the given inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
