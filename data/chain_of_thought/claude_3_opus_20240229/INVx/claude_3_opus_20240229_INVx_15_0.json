This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n4) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" from the original statement. The dreb could be spened for a reason other than being vroombed.\n\nAnswer: no"
