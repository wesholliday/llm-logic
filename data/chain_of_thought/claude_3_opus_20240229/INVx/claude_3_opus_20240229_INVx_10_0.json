            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement.\n\n3) In general, the statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\n   For example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like if a sprinkler was on.\n\n4) However, there are certain situations where \"If P, then Q\" does imply \"If not P, then not Q\". This is when Q can ONLY be true if P is true. \n\n   For example, consider the statement \"If a shape is a square, then it has four sides\". This does imply that \"If a shape does not have four sides, then it is not a square\", because having four sides is a necessary condition for being a square.\n\n5) In the given statement, we don't have enough information to know whether being sproinged is the ONLY way for the wug to be garpled. There could be other ways for the wug to be garpled without being sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
