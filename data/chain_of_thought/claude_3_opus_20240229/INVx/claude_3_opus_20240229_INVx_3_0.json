This does not necessarily mean that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original statement, it's possible that the splat could quank for a reason other than being morphed.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
