In other words, the antecedent of the conditional (p) is false.\n\n3) When the antecedent of a conditional is false, we cannot make any inference about the truth value of the consequent. The conditional statement as a whole is still true, regardless of whether the consequent is true or false.\n\n4) Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer anything about whether the truck was metal or not. The truck could be metal, or it could be not metal. We simply don't have enough information to determine which is the case.\n\nAnswer: no"
