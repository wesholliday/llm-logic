This is because a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. In all other cases (including when the antecedent is false), the conditional is true.\n\n4) So in this case, we can't infer anything about whether the unicorn was in the forest or not. The unicorn could have been in the forest, or it could have been somewhere else. The given information is insufficient to determine the location of the unicorn.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no"
