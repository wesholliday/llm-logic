The conditional statement does not imply the converse: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" But we don't know whether this means that Kate ate salad or not. She could have eaten salad for reasons unrelated to Ben's pasta consumption.\n\n4) Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer anything definite about whether Kate ate salad or not. The fact that Ben did not eat pasta does not necessarily mean that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: no"
