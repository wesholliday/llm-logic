In other words, the dog being inside is a sufficient condition for the cat being outside.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that the dog was not inside. \n\n3. Now, we need to consider whether we can infer the location of the cat based on these two pieces of information.\n\n4. The first statement only tells us what happens if the dog is inside. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the dog is not inside. \n\n5. In other words, we don't know if the cat being outside is a necessary condition for the dog being inside. The cat could still be outside even when the dog is not inside.\n\n6. Therefore, just because the dog is not inside, we cannot infer that the cat is not outside. The cat's location is independent of the dog's location in this case.\n\nAnswer: no"
