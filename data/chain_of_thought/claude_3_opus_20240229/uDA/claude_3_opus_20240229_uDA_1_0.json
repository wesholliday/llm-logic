            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n2) However, this statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Mary was not at the wedding. Sue could still have been at the wedding even if Mary wasn't.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This is the negation of the condition in the first statement.\n\n4) In logic, when we have a conditional statement and we know that the condition is false, we can't conclude anything about the consequence. This is because a conditional statement only tells us what happens when the condition is true, not when it's false.\n\n5) Therefore, even though we know Mary was not at the wedding, we can't infer anything about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. Sue could have been there, or she could have not been there. We simply don't have enough information to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no"
