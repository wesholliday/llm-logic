            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. \n   This means that being written by James is a sufficient condition for the book being a mystery novel.\n   However, it does not mean that this is a necessary condition. In other words, books written by other authors could also be mystery novels.\n\n2) The second statement says: The book was not written by James. \n   This negates the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the first statement.\n\n3) When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, we cannot draw any conclusion about the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n   In other words, the fact that the book was not written by James does not allow us to conclude anything about whether or not it is a mystery novel.\n\n4) The book could still be a mystery novel, even though it was not written by James. Or it could be a different genre. We simply don't have enough information to say for certain.\n\nAnswer: no"
