It states that the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake. In other words, if the vampire is not awake, we cannot conclude anything about the mummy from this statement alone.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake. \n\n4) However, just because the vampire was not awake, we cannot conclude that the mummy was not awake. The mummy could be awake or asleep, independent of the vampire's state.\n\n5) The condition in the first statement (the vampire being awake) was not met, so we cannot apply the conclusion of that statement (that the mummy was awake).\n\nTherefore, we do not have enough information to infer whether the mummy was awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
