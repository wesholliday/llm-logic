            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car is red, it necessarily follows that the truck is blue. However, it doesn't say anything about what color the truck is if the car is not red.\n\n2) The second statement tells us that \"the car was not red.\" \n\n3) From these two statements, we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck. The truck could be blue, or it could be any other color.\n\n4) The first statement only tells us about the truck's color under the specific condition that the car is red. Since this condition is not met (the car is not red), the statement doesn't apply and doesn't give us any information.\n\n5) Therefore, we do not have enough information to infer that the truck is not blue. It might be blue, or it might not be. We simply can't tell from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
