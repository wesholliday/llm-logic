Chris may or may not have finished the race in this case.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"Alex did not finish the race.\" \n\n4) From these two statements alone, we cannot determine whether or not Chris finished the race. The first statement only tells us what happens if Alex did finish the race, but we know that Alex did not finish the race.\n\n5) Therefore, we do not have enough information to infer whether or not Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
