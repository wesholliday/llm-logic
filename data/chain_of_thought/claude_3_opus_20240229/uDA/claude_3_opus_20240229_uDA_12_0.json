The first statement is a conditional: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\n2. However, this does not mean that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. Lucy could have gone to the zoo independently of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This means the condition in the first statement is false.\n\n4. When the condition of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequence. In other words, we cannot determine whether Lucy went to the zoo or not based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no"
