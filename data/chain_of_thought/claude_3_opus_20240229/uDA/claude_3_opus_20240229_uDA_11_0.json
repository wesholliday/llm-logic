In other words, p is false.\n\n3) Now, in a conditional statement, if the antecedent (p) is false, we cannot infer anything about the consequent (q). The consequent (q) could be either true or false.\n\n4) So, even though we know the cake was not chocolate, we cannot infer anything about whether the muffins were blueberry or not. The muffins could have been blueberry, or they could have been any other flavor.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no"
