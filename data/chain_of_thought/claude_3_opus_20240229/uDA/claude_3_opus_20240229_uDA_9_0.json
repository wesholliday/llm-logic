            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement gives a conditional: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. In logic, this can be written as \"Lisa red shirt \u2192 Mark blue shirt\".\n\n2. The second statement tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is the negation of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional.\n\n3. In logic, when we have a conditional statement and we know the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of the consequent (the \"then\" part). This is because a conditional statement only tells us what happens if the antecedent is true, not what happens if it's false.\n\n4. So, even though Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot infer anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. He might have bought it, or he might not have - we simply don't have enough information to say for sure.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
