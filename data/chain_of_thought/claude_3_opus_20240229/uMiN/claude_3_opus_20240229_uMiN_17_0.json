In other words, it's not certain that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer that \"it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\". \n\n3) The phrase \"it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" is equivalent to saying \"the scarf is not necessarily in the backpack\".\n\n4) If the scarf might not be in the backpack (as stated in the original sentence), then it follows that the scarf is not necessarily in the backpack. \n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer that \"it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
