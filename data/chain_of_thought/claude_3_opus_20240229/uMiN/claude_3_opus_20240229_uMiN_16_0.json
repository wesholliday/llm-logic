In other words, it's not certain that the pen is in the bag.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the second statement: \"it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\". This is equivalent to saying \"it's not necessary that the pen is in the bag\".\n\n3) If it's not certain that the pen is in the bag (from statement 1), then it's indeed true that it's not necessary that the pen is in the bag. If the pen might not be in the bag, then it can't be the case that it must be in the bag.\n\n4) Therefore, from the first statement, we can indeed infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
