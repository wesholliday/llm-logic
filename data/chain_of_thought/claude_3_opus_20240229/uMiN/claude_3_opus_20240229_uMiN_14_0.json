In other words, it's not certain that the milk is on the counter.\n\n2) Now, the second statement \"it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" is saying that it's not necessarily true that the milk is on the counter. \n\n3) If it's not necessarily true that the milk is on the counter, then there must be a possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\n4) This is exactly what the first statement is saying - there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement is inferring the same thing as the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
