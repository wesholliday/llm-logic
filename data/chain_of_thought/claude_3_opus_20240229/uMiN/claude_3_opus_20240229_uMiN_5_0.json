In other words, it's not certain that Jeff played basketball.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer from this that \"it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\".\n\n3) \"Jeff must have played basketball\" would mean that it's absolutely certain that Jeff played basketball, that there's no possibility he didn't play.\n\n4) If there's a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball (as stated in the first sentence), then it cannot be the case that Jeff must have played basketball. These two statements are contradictory.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer that \"it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" from the statement \"Jeff might not have played basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
