In other words, it's not certain that she chose pizza.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer from this that \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\".\n\n3) \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" would mean that it is certain or necessary that Sue chose pizza. \n\n4) If there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza (as stated in the first sentence), then it cannot be certain or necessary that she chose pizza.\n\n5) Therefore, we can indeed infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
