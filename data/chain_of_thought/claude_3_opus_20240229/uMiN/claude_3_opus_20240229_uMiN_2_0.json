In other words, it's not certain that the griffin was in the forest.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer that \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".\n\n3) \"The griffin must have been in the forest\" would mean that it's absolutely certain or necessary that the griffin was in the forest. \n\n4) If it's possible that the griffin was not in the forest (as stated in the first sentence), then it cannot be the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. If there's a possibility of the griffin not being in the forest, then it's not absolutely certain or necessary that it was in the forest.\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\", we can indeed infer that \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
