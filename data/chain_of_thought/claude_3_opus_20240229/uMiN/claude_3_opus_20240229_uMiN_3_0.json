In other words, it's not certain that James wrote the book.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer from this that \"it's not the case that the book must have been written by James\".\n\n3) The phrase \"the book must have been written by James\" means that it is necessarily true that James wrote the book - there is no possibility of anyone else being the author.\n\n4) If there is a possibility that someone other than James wrote the book (as stated in the first sentence), then it cannot be necessarily true that James wrote the book.\n\n5) Therefore, if the book might not have been written by James, we can indeed infer that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
