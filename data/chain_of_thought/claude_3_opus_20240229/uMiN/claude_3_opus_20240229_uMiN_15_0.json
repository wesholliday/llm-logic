In other words, it's not certain that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer that \"it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\". \n\n3) The phrase \"the shoes must be in the closet\" means that it is necessarily true that the shoes are in the closet, i.e., there is no possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n4) The phrase \"it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" is the negation of \"the shoes must be in the closet\". It means that it is not necessarily true that the shoes are in the closet, i.e., there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n5) The statement in step 1 and the statement in step 4 are saying the same thing: there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n6) Therefore, from the statement \"The shoes might not be in the closet\", we can indeed infer that \"it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
