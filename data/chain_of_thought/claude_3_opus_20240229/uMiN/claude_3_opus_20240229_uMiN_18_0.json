In other words, it's not certain that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the second statement: \"it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\". This means that it's not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\n3) If the notebook might not be in the drawer (first statement), then it follows that it's not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer (second statement).\n\n4) In other words, if there's a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer, then we can't say that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, from the first statement, we can indeed infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
