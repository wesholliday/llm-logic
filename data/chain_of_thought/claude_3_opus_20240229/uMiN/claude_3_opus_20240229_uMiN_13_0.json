In other words, it's not certain that the toy is in the box.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the second statement: \"it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\". This means that it's not necessarily true that the toy is in the box. \n\n3) If it's not certain that the toy is in the box (from statement 1), then it follows that it's not necessarily true that the toy is in the box. \n\n4) Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\n5) So, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
