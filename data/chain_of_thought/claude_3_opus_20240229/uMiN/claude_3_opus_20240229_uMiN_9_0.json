The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n2. If there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it cannot be certain that she bought it.\n\n3. The phrase \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" implies certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n4. Since there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (according to the given statement), it contradicts the certainty implied by the phrase \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\".\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, because the possibility that she might not have bought it negates the certainty that she must have bought it.\n\nAnswer: yes"
