In other words, Mary's presence at the wedding is not certain.\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer from this that \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\".\n\n3) \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" would mean that Mary's presence at the wedding was absolutely necessary or certain. \n\n4) If there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding (as stated in the first sentence), then it cannot be the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. The two statements are contradictory.\n\n5) Therefore, if \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" is true, then we can indeed infer that \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
