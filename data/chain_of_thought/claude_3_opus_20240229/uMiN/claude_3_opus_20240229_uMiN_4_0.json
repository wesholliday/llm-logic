In other words, it's not certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer that \"it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\".\n\n3) \"The alien must have visited Mars\" would mean that it is absolutely certain or necessary that the alien visited Mars.\n\n4) The negation of this, \"it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\", means that it is not certain or necessary that the alien visited Mars.\n\n5) If it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be certain or necessary that the alien visited Mars.\n\n6) Therefore, from the statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\", we can indeed infer that \"it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
