In other words, it's not certain that Alex finished the race.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the second statement: \"it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\". \n\n3) If Alex must have finished the race, it would mean that it's absolutely certain that Alex finished the race. There's no possibility that he didn't finish.\n\n4) The second statement negates this. It says it's not the case that Alex must have finished. In other words, it's not certain that Alex finished the race.\n\n5) This is exactly what the first statement says - that it's not certain that Alex finished the race.\n\n6) Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first. If Alex might not have finished the race, then it's indeed not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
