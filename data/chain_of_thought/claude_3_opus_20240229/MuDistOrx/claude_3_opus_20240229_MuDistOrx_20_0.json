            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The flim must quazzle a frazzle or quazzle a glorp\" is a disjunction, meaning it presents two alternatives joined by the word \"or\". In propositional logic, we can rewrite a disjunction of the form \"P or Q\" in the logically equivalent form \"P or it must be the case that Q\", since the two alternatives are mutually exclusive - if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nSo in this case, we can indeed rewrite \"The flim must quazzle a frazzle or quazzle a glorp\" as the logically equivalent statement \"The flim must quazzle a frazzle or it must quazzle a glorp\". The meaning is the same - the flim is required to do one of those two things, but not both.\n\nAnswer: yes"
