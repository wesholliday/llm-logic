The rephrased statement conveys the same meaning, just with slightly different wording. It still presents the same two possibilities for the shimble, connected by the \"or\".\n\nSince both statements have the same logical meaning, we can indeed infer the rephrased version from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
