            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" uses the logical operator \"or\". In propositional logic, the statement \"P or Q\" is logically equivalent to the statement \"P or Q\", meaning either P is true, or Q is true, or both are true.\n\nIn this case, let P represent \"The blimp must gribble a flonk\" and Q represent \"The blimp must gribble a wibble snorkel\". The original statement is saying that either P is true or Q is true. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel\", is essentially restating the original statement with the \"it\" referring back to \"The blimp\". The meaning remains the same: either P is true or Q is true.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
