            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zibber must gronk a quank or gronk a zump crunk\" means that the zibber is required to do one of two things: either gronk a quank, or gronk a zump crunk.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The zibber must gronk a quank or it must gronk a zump crunk\" has the same logical structure and meaning. It states that the zibber is required to do one of the same two things: either gronk a quank, or gronk a zump crunk. The only difference is the addition of \"it\" in the second part, which refers back to \"the zibber\" and doesn't change the meaning.\n\nSince the proposed inference has the same logical structure and meaning as the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
