            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" provides information about the dress code or atmosphere of the event. However, it does not necessarily imply that tickets were required for entry. Formal events can be either ticketed or non-ticketed, depending on the specific circumstances. The given information is insufficient to determine whether tickets were mandatory for attending the event. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\" based solely on the statement \"The event must have been formal.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
