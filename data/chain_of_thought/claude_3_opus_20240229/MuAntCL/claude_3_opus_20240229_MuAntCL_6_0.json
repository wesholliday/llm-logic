            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" provides information only about the ticket sales for the concert. It suggests that all available tickets were purchased. However, this statement alone does not give any information about the start time of the concert.\n\nTo infer that \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\", we would need additional information specifically mentioning the start time. Without this information, we cannot assume the concert started at 8 PM just because it was sold out.\n\nIn other words, while the original statement is true, adding the extra condition about the start time without any supporting evidence makes the inference invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
