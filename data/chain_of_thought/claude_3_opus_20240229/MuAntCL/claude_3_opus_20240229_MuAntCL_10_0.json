            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed\" only tells us that the document was signed. It does not provide any information about whether the document was also notarized. Notarization is a separate process from signing, where a notary public officially witnesses the signing of a document and verifies the identity of the person signing it. Just because a document was signed does not necessarily mean it was also notarized. To infer that the document was both signed and notarized, we would need additional information specifically indicating that notarization took place.\n\nAnswer: no"
