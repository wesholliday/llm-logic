            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" does not necessarily imply that the package was signed for upon delivery. Packages can be delivered without requiring a signature, such as when they are left at the doorstep, with a neighbor, or in a designated safe location. The given statement only asserts that the delivery took place yesterday, without providing any information about whether a signature was obtained or not. To infer that the package was signed for, we would need additional information or context.\n\nAnswer: no"
