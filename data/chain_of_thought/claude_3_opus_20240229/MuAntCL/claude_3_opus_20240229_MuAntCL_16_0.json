However, it does not mention anything about the presence of fresh towels. While it is possible that fresh towels were provided as part of the daily cleaning routine, this information is not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by the given statement. We cannot logically infer the presence of fresh towels based solely on the information that the room was cleaned daily.\n\nAnswer: no"
