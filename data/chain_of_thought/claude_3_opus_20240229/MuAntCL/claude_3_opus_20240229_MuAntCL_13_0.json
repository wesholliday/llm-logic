            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English\" only provides information about the language of the movie. It does not mention anything about the presence or absence of subtitles. Subtitles are a separate feature that can be added to movies regardless of the language they are in. A movie in English may or may not have subtitles, and the presence of subtitles is not necessarily implied by the movie being in English. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the movie must have had subtitles based solely on the information that it was in English.\n\nAnswer: no"
