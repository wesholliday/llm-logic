            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" only provides information about the deadline for completing the project. It does not give any information about the project's budget or whether it was completed under budget.\n\nTo infer that \"The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget,\" we would need additional information that is not provided in the original statement. The original statement is only concerned with the project's completion deadline, not its financial aspects.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that the project must have been both completed by Friday and under budget.\n\nAnswer: no"
