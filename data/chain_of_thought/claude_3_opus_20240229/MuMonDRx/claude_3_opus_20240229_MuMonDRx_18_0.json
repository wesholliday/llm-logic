However, it does not mention anything about the fizzle being on a quank gribble. \n\nThe inferred statement introduces a new condition - that the fizzle must be on a quank gribble - which is not supported by the original statement. The original statement also does not indicate that being on a quank gribble is an alternative to being zazzle with gronk.\n\nWithout additional context or information, we cannot assume the fizzle has the option of being on a quank gribble. The inferred statement goes beyond what can be logically concluded from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
