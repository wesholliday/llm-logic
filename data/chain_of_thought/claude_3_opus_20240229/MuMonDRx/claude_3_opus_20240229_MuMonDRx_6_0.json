In other words, all zibbers are fizzle zibbers.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer from this that a zibber must be either a bimboozle or a fizzle zibber. \n\nHowever, the original statement says nothing about bimboozles. It's possible that some zibbers are bimboozles, but it's also possible that no zibbers are bimboozles. The statement \"The zibber must be fizzle zibber\" alone does not give us enough information to determine whether zibbers can also be bimboozles.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that a zibber must be either a bimboozle or a fizzle zibber. The inference is not valid based solely on the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
