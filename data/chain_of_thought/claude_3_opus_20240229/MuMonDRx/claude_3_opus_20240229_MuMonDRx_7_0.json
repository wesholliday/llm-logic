            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wibble must be zizz\" means that being zizz is a necessary condition for being a wibble. In other words, all wibbles are zizz.\n\nThe statement \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz\" means that being either wobble or zizz is a necessary condition for being a wibble. In other words, all wibbles are either wobble or zizz.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that all wibbles are zizz, then it logically follows that all wibbles are either wobble or zizz, because zizz is included in \"wobble or zizz\". The wobble part is irrelevant, because even if no wibbles are wobble, we still know all of them are zizz, which satisfies the \"wobble or zizz\" condition.\n\nTherefore, yes, from \"The wibble must be zizz\", we can infer \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
