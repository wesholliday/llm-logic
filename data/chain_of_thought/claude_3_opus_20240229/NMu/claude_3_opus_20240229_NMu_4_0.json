            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" can be rephrased as \"It's not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars\".\n\n2) This means there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. In other words, the alien's visit to Mars is not certain.\n\n3) The second statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" also suggests that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n4) Both statements are expressing the same idea: that it's possible the alien did not visit Mars. The first statement expresses this by negating the certainty of the alien's visit, while the second statement directly states the possibility of the alien not visiting.\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first. If it's not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars, then it follows that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
