It's equivalent to saying there's a chance something is not true.\n\n6) Since the original statement establishes the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, it directly supports the inference that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
