In other words, there's a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n3) Now, let's look at the second statement: \"The shoes might not be in the closet\". \n\n4) This statement also suggests that there's a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n5) Both statements are expressing the same idea: that it's possible that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n6) Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
