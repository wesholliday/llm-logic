It could be, but it's not certain.\n\n2) Now, the question is whether we can infer \"The pen might not be in my bag\" from this.\n\n3) \"The pen might not be in my bag\" means there's a possibility the pen is not in the bag. \n\n4) If it's not certain that the pen is in the bag (the original statement), then there must be a possibility that it's not in the bag.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"The pen might not be in my bag\" from \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
