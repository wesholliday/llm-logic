            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" can be rephrased as \"It's not necessarily true that the book was written by James\".\n\n2) This means there is a possibility that the book was not written by James. In other words, it's not certain that James wrote the book.\n\n3) The second statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" is saying essentially the same thing - there is a possibility that James did not write the book.\n\n4) Both statements are expressing uncertainty about James being the author of the book. The first statement does this by negating the certainty of James being the author, while the second statement directly states the possibility of James not being the author.\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first. If it's not necessarily true that James wrote the book, then it follows that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
