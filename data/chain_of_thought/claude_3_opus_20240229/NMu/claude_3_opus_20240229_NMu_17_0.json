In other words, there's a possibility that the scarf is not in my backpack.\n\n3) The second statement, \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\", is saying essentially the same thing - that there's a possibility the scarf is not in my backpack.\n\n4) If the scarf is not necessarily in my backpack (first statement), then it follows that the scarf might not be in my backpack (second statement).\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement can indeed be inferred from the first. If it's not the case that something must be true, then it might not be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
