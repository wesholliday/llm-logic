            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully\". \n   Let's define:\n   P = \"the meal was prepared\"\n   C = \"the meal was prepared carefully\"\n   \n   So the original statement can be written as: P \u2192 not C\n\n2) We want to know if we can infer: \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\", i.e., C \u2192 not P\n\n3) The contrapositive of a statement of the form A \u2192 B is not B \u2192 not A. The contrapositive is always true if and only if the original statement is true.\n\n4) The contrapositive of the original statement (P \u2192 not C) is:\n   not (not C) \u2192 not P\n   This simplifies to: C \u2192 not P\n\n5) This is exactly the statement we were asked about. Since the contrapositive is always equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
