            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\". \n   Let's break this down into two parts:\n   - p: advice was offered\n   - q: the advice was helpful\n   \n   So the original statement in logical form is: p \u2192 \u00acq\n   (If p then not q)\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\".\n   Again, let's break this down:\n   - q: the advice was helpful\n   - p: advice was offered\n   \n   So the question is asking if we can infer: q \u2192 \u00acp\n   (If q then not p)\n\n3) In general, if a statement is of the form \"If A then B\", it does not necessarily imply \"If B then A\". \n   This is because the original statement only tells us what happens if A is true, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if B is true.\n\n4) In this specific case, the original statement (p \u2192 \u00acq) does not imply the inferred statement (q \u2192 \u00acp). \n   The original statement says that if advice was offered, it wasn't helpful. But it doesn't say anything about what happens if the advice was helpful.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
