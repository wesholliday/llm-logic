            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"the room was cleaned\" and Q is \"it was cleaned thoroughly\".\n\n2) We are asked whether we can infer \"If Q, then not P\" from this. In other words, can we infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\"?\n\n3) In general, the converse of a statement (which is what we're trying to infer here) is not logically equivalent to the original statement. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" does not imply \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" (because the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) In this specific case, \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" is a contradiction. If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it must have been cleaned.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\".\n\nAnswer: no"
