In all other cases, it is true.\n\n5) In the original statement (If P, then not Q), the only case where it is false is when P is true and not Q is false, i.e., when P is true and Q is true.\n\n6) The inference (If Q, then not P) is saying that if Q is true, then P must be false. \n\n7) But the original statement does not say anything about the case when Q is true. It only talks about when P is true. \n\n8) Therefore, we cannot make the inference \"If Q, then not P\" from the original statement. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
