            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The given statement is: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\". \n   Let's call \"it's raining\" as P, and \"it's not raining hard\" as Q.\n   So the given statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n\n2) Now, the question is asking if we can infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" from the given statement.\n   Let's call \"it's raining hard\" as R.\n   So the question is asking if we can infer: R \u2192 ~P\n\n3) Let's consider the truth table:\n\n   P | Q | R | P \u2192 Q | R \u2192 ~P\n   -------------------------------\n   T | T | T |   T   |   F\n   T | T | F |   T   |   T\n   T | F | T |   F   |   F\n   T | F | F |   F   |   T\n   F | T | T |   T   |   T\n   F | T | F |   T   |   T\n   F | F | T |   T   |   T\n   F | F | F |   T   |   T\n\n4) From the truth table, we can see that when P \u2192 Q is true, R \u2192 ~P is not always true. In fact, R \u2192 ~P is false when P, Q, and R are all true.\n\n5) This means that the statement \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" (R \u2192 ~P) does not necessarily follow from the given statement \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" (P \u2192 Q).\n\nAnswer: no"
