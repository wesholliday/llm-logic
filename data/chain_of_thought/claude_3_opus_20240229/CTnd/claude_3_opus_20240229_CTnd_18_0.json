            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\". \n   Let's call \"the issue was discussed\" proposition P, and \"it was discussed in depth\" proposition Q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: If P, then not Q.\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\". \n   Using our propositions, this is asking if we can infer: If Q, then not P.\n\n3) In propositional logic, \"If P, then not Q\" is not equivalent to \"If Q, then not P\". \n   These are not logically equivalent statements.\n\n4) For example, consider this: If it's a dog, then it's not a cat. (If P, then not Q)\n   This does not imply that: If it's a cat, then it's not a dog. (If Q, then not P)\n   Because something could be neither a dog nor a cat.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original statement, the issue could have been neither discussed nor discussed in depth. \n   The original statement doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
