In other words, P \u2192 Q does not necessarily imply Q \u2192 P.\n\n4) In this case, the statement we're trying to infer (Q \u2192 not P) is not the converse of the original statement. It's actually the inverse of the original statement.\n\n5) The inverse of a statement P \u2192 not Q is not P \u2192 Q. Again, a statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
