These are called converse statements, and they are not logically equivalent.\n\n4) For example, consider: \n   \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (p \u2192 q)\n   This does not imply:\n   \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\" (q \u2192 p)\n   The ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in our problem, just because studying implies not studying long, it doesn't mean that studying long implies not studying at all. Jane could have studied long and still studied.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
