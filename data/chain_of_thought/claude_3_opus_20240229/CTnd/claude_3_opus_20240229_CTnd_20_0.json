That means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statement \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation\" (P \u2192 ~Q), \n   we can indeed infer \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\" (Q \u2192 ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes"
