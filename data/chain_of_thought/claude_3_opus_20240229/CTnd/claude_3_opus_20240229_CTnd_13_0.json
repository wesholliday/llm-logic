            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\". \n   Let's call \"Alex exercised\" as P, and \"Alex did not exercise much\" as Q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\".\n   Let's call \"Alex exercised much\" as R, and \"Alex did not exercise\" as S.\n   So the question is asking if we can infer: R \u2192 S\n\n3) Now, R is the opposite of Q. If Q is \"Alex did not exercise much\", then R, which is \"Alex exercised much\", is the negation of Q.\n\n4) Similarly, S is the opposite of P. If P is \"Alex exercised\", then S, which is \"Alex did not exercise\", is the negation of P.\n\n5) So the question is essentially asking: If we know P \u2192 Q, can we infer (not Q) \u2192 (not P)?\n\n6) This is a fallacy in logic. Just because P implies Q, it doesn't mean that (not Q) implies (not P). \n\n7) For example, if we say \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\", it doesn't mean that \"If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining\". The ground could be not wet because the rain stopped some time ago, or because it was never raining in the first place.\n\n8) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" from \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\".\n\nAnswer: no"
