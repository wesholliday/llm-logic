            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"the room was tidied\" and Q is \"it was tidied thoroughly\".\n\n2) We are asked whether we can infer \"If Q, then not P\" from this. In other words, can we swap P and Q and negate both of them?\n\n3) In general, \"If P, then Q\" is not equivalent to \"If Q, then P\". These are called converse statements, and they are not logically equivalent. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" does not imply \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" (because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler).\n\n4) However, \"If P, then not Q\" is actually equivalent to \"If Q, then not P\". These are called contrapositive statements, and they are logically equivalent. \n\n5) Therefore, from \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\", we can indeed infer \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
