It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the splat is quanked, or the splat is morphed, or both.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities (the splat being quanked) is not true.\n\n4) If we know that a disjunction is true, and we also know that one of the disjuncts is false, then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true. This is because for an \"or\" statement to be true, at least one part must be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\" is true, and we also know \"The splat is quanked\" is false. Therefore, \"The splat is morphed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
