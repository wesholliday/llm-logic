This is a logical disjunction - it means at least one of those two things must be true. The zinger must be either smoogled, or fraggled, or possibly both.\n\n2) The second statement says \"The zinger is not smoogled\". This rules out the possibility of the zinger being smoogled. \n\n3) So from the first statement, we know the zinger must be either smoogled or fraggled. And from the second statement, we know it's not smoogled.\n\n4) Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled. If it's not smoogled, and it must be either smoogled or fraggled, then it has to be fraggled.\n\n5) So yes, from those two statements, we can logically infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
