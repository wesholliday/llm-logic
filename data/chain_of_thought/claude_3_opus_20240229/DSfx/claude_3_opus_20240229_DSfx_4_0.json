It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the fribble is crinked, or it is snurgled, or possibly both.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities, namely that the fribble is crinked, is not true.\n\n4) If we know that a disjunction is true, and we also know that one of the disjuncts is false, then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true. \n\n5) In this case, since we know \"either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled\" is true, and we also know \"the fribble is crinked\" is false, we can infer that \"the fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
