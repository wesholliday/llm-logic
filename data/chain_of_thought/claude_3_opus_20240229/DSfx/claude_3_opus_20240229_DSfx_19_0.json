It says that at least one of two possibilities must be true: either the smonk is plagged, or the smonk is vreebled. It could be both, but it must be at least one.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities is not true: the smonk is not plagged.\n\n4) If the smonk is not plagged, and we know that it must be either plagged or vreebled, then the only remaining possibility is that it is vreebled.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
