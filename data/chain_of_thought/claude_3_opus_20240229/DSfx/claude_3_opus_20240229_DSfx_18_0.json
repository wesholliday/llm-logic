It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the shank is nugged, or the shank is plooked.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It states that the shank is not nugged.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we can reason as follows:\n   - The shank must be either nugged or plooked (from statement 1)\n   - The shank is not nugged (from statement 2)\n   - Therefore, the shank must be plooked\n\n5) This is a valid logical inference. If we assume the truth of the two given statements, then we can indeed infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
