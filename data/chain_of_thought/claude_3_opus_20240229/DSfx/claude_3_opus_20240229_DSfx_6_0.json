It says that one of two possibilities must be true: either the grommet is plopped, or the grommet is sploffed. It can't be neither, and it can't be both (assuming \"plopped\" and \"sploffed\" are mutually exclusive).\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities is not true: the grommet is not plopped.\n\n4) If the grommet is not plopped, and we know that it must be either plopped or sploffed, then the only remaining possibility is that it is sploffed.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
