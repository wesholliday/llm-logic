It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the sneg is sproted, or the sneg is crampled. It could be both, but it must be at least one.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the sneg is not sproted.\n\n4) If the sneg is not sproted, and we know that either it is sproted or it is crampled, then it must be crampled. There's no other option.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
