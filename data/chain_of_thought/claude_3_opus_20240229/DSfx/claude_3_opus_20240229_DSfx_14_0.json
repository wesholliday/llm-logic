It says the clug must be either snugged or fleeked. It can't be both, and it must be one of the two.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the clug is not snugged. \n\n4) If the clug is not snugged, and it must be either snugged or fleeked, then the only remaining possibility is that it is fleeked.\n\n5) Therefore, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
