It states that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the twonk is varnished, or the twonk is plinked.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It states that the twonk is not plinked.\n\n4) If we know that one part of a disjunction is false, then for the disjunction to be true, the other part must be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know \"the twonk is plinked\" is false. Therefore, for the disjunction \"either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\" to be true, \"the twonk is varnished\" must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the twonk is varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
