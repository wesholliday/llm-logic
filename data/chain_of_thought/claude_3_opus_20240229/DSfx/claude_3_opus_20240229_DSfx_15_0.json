It says that at least one of the two possibilities must be true: either the dreb is spened, or the dreb is vroombed, or both.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities, \"the dreb is spened\", is not true.\n\n4) If we know that one part of an \"or\" statement is false, then for the overall \"or\" statement to be true, the other part must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if \"the dreb is spened\" is false, then \"the dreb is vroombed\" must be true for the first statement to be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that \"the dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
