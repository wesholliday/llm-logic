It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the smip is lupped, or the smip is shripped.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities (the smip being lupped) is not true.\n\n4) If we know that a disjunction is true, and we also know that one of the disjuncts (one part of the \"or\" statement) is false, then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true.\n\n5) In this case, since we know \"the smip is lupped or the smip is shripped\" is true, and we also know \"the smip is lupped\" is false, we can infer that \"the smip is shripped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
