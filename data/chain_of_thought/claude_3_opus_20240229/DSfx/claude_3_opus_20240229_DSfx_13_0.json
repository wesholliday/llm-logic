It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the glip is tragged, or the glip is slogged.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities (the glip being tragged) is not true.\n\n4) If we know that a disjunction is true, and we also know that one of the disjuncts (one part of the \"or\" statement) is false, then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged\" is true, and we also know \"The glip is tragged\" is false. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
