This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these must be true. It could be that the flob is movated, or that it is skizzled, or both.\n\n2) The second statement says \"The flob is not movated\". This eliminates the possibility that the flob is movated.\n\n3) Now, looking back at the first statement, if the flob is not movated, then for the disjunction to be true, the flob must be skizzled.\n\n4) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
