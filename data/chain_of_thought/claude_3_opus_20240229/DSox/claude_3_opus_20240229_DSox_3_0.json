It says the splat is either morphed or quanked. Those are the only two possibilities given.\n\n4) But we already determined in step 2 that the splat is not quanked. \n\n5) Therefore, since we've ruled out the splat being quanked, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the splat must be morphed.\n\nSo putting it all together, yes, from the two given statements we can logically infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
