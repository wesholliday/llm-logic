Those are the only two possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the whiffle is definitely not tinked, then looking at the two possibilities in the second statement, the whiffle must be shanked. There is no other option given the information provided.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, from the two given statements we can logically infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
