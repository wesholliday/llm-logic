From the first statement, we know that the dreb is definitely not spened. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - the dreb must be either vroombed or spened. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we already determined in step 2 that the dreb is not spened, that eliminates one of the two possibilities from the second statement.\n\n5. The only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, if the dreb is not spened, and it must be either vroombed or spened, then it logically follows that the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
