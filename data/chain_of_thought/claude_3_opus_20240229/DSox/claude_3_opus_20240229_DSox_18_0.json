From the first statement, we know the shank is not nugged. \n4. Looking at the second statement, it presents two possibilities - either the shank is plooked, or the shank is nugged.\n5. But we already determined in step 3 that the shank is not nugged. \n6. Therefore, for the second statement to be true, the other possibility must be the case - i.e. the shank must be plooked.\n\nSo yes, from the two given statements, we can logically infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
