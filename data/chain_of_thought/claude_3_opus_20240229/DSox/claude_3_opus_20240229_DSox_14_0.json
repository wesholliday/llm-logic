We are also told \"Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged\". This means the clug must have one of two possible properties - it is either fleeked or snugged. \n\n3. From the first statement, we already determined the clug is not snugged. \n\n4. Since the clug must be either fleeked or snugged, and we know it is not snugged, the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, yes, from the two given statements we can logically infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
