The first statement tells us that the wug is definitely not bimmed. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - the wug must be either flooped or bimmed. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the wug is not bimmed, that eliminates one of the two possibilities in the second statement. \n\n5. The only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer that the wug must be flooped, given the information in the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
