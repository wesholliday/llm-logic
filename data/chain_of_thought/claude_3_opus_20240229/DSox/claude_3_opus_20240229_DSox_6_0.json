We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet is not plopped\"\n   - \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\"\n\n2. The first statement clearly tells us that the grommet is not plopped. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - the grommet must be either sploffed or plopped. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the grommet is not plopped, then in the either/or situation presented in the second statement, the grommet must be sploffed.\n\n5. If the grommet was not sploffed, then according to the second statement it would have to be plopped. But the first statement rules out the possibility of the grommet being plopped.\n\n6. Therefore, the only possibility that fits with both statements is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
