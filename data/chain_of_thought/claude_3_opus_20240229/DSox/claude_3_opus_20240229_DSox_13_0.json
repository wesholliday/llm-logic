From the first statement, we know that the glip is definitely not tragged. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - the glip must be either slogged or tragged. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the glip is not tragged, that eliminates one of the two possibilities in the second statement. \n\n5. The only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination using the information given in the two statements, we can logically infer that the glip must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
