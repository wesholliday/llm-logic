Those are the only two possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the zinger is definitely not smoogled, then looking at the two possibilities in the second statement, the zinger must be fraggled.\n\n5) If the zinger was not fraggled, the second statement would be false, because the zinger would be neither fraggled nor smoogled. But we are told the second statement is true.\n\n6) Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
