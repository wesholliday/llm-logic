Those are the only two possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we determined in step 2 that the fleeg is not surned, then looking at the two possibilities in the second statement, the fleeg must be bluttered. There is no other option if we take both statements to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, from the two given statements we can logically infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
