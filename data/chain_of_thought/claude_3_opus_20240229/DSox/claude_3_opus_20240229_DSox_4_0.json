We are also told \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked\". This is an either/or statement - it says the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked, but not both. \n\n3. From statement 1, we already know the fribble is not crinked. \n\n4. Therefore, for the either/or statement in 2 to be true, the fribble must be snurgled. If it was neither snurgled nor crinked, statement 2 would be false.\n\n5. So yes, we can logically infer that the fribble is snurgled. The two given statements together necessitate this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
