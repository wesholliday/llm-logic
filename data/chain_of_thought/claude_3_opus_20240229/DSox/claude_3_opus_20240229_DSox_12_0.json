We are also told \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped\". This is an either/or statement - it says the smip must have one property or the other, but not both. \n\n3. From statement 1, we know the smip is not lupped. Therefore, for the either/or statement in 2 to be true, the smip must be shripped.\n\n4. If the smip was not shripped, then both parts of statement 2 would be false (it would be neither shripped nor lupped). But statement 2 says one part must be true. The only way for that to be the case, given statement 1, is if the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, yes, from the two given statements we can logically conclude that the smip must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
