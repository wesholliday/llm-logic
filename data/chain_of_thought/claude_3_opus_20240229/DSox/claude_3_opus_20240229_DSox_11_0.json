From the first statement, we know the flug is definitely not zimmed. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - the flug must be either blummed or zimmed. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we determined in step 2 that the flug is not zimmed, that eliminates one of the two possibilities from the second statement. \n\n5. The only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer that the flug must be blummed, given the two statements provided.\n\nAnswer: yes"
