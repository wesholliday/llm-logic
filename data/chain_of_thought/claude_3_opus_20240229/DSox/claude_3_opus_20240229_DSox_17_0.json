The first statement clearly tells us that the flob is not movated. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - the flob must be either skizzled or movated. It can't be both, and it must be one of the two.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flob is not movated, then in the either/or situation presented in the second statement, the flob must be skizzled.\n\n5. If the flob was not skizzled, then according to the second statement it would have to be movated. But we know it's not movated from the first statement. Therefore, it must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
