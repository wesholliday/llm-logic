It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the sneg is crampled, or the sneg is sproted.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the sneg is not sproted. In other words, the second possibility in the disjunction is false.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one of the possibilities is false, then the other possibility must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since we know that the sneg is not sproted, and we know that either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted, we can infer that the sneg must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
