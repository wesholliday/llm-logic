So we know the smonk definitely isn't plagged.\n\n2) We are also told \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\". This is an either/or statement - one of those two things must be true, but not both. \n\n3) Since we already determined in step 1 that the smonk is not plagged, then for the either/or statement in step 2 to be true, the other option must be the case - the smonk must be vreebled.\n\n4) Therefore, yes, from the two given statements we can logically infer that the smonk is vreebled. If it wasn't vreebled, then both given statements couldn't be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
