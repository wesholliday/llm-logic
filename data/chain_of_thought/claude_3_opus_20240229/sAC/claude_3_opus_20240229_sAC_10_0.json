'The cat was outside' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'the dog was inside' is true, then the consequence 'the cat was outside' must also be true. However, it does not say anything about the reverse case - if the cat was outside, it doesn't necessarily mean the dog was inside.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'The cat was outside' is indeed true. However, this doesn't give us any information about whether the dog was inside or not.\n\nConsider these possibilities:\n- The dog was inside, and therefore the cat was outside (consistent with both statements).\n- The dog was outside, and the cat was also outside (consistent with the second statement, and doesn't contradict the first because the first statement doesn't specify what happens if the dog was outside).\n\nSince there is a scenario where the cat is outside but the dog is not inside, we cannot conclude with certainty that 'The dog was inside' must be true.\n\nAnswer: no"
