This means that if 'G \u2192 U' is true, then either '\u00acG' is true or 'U' is true, or both.\n\nGiven:\n1. G \u2192 U is true\n2. U is true\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that 'U' is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'G' is true. The truth of 'U' could be due to the fact that '\u00acG' is true, making the entire statement 'G \u2192 U' true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of 'U' does not imply the truth of 'G'. The griffin may or may not have been in the forest, and the given statements do not provide enough information to determine the truth value of 'G'.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that 'The griffin was in the forest' is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
