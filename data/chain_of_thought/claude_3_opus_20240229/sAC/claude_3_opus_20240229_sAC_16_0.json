            "content": "To determine if 'The shirt was cotton' must be true, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is true.\n2. 'The pants were denim' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'the shirt was cotton' is true, then the consequence 'the pants were denim' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about the reverse - if the pants were denim, the shirt may or may not have been cotton.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'the pants were denim' is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton. There could be other reasons why the pants were denim, independent of the shirt's material.\n\nIn other words, while the given statements are consistent with 'the shirt was cotton', they do not guarantee or require it to be true. The shirt could have been made of another material, and the pants could still be denim.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The shirt was cotton' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
