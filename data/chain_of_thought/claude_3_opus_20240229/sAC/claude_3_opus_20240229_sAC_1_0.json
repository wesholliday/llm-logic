This is a conditional statement. Let's call this statement (1).\n\n2) We are also given that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. Let's call this statement (2).\n\n3) Now, in a conditional statement, if the consequent (the part after \"then\") is true, we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of the antecedent (the part after \"if\"). \n\n4) In this case, statement (2) tells us that the consequent of statement (1) is true. But this doesn't allow us to conclude anything about the antecedent, which is \"Mary was at the wedding\".\n\n5) Mary could have been at the wedding, or she could have not been at the wedding. Either way, the given statements would still be true.\n\n6) Therefore, we do not have enough information to conclude whether \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
