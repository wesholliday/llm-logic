'Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'Joe went to the park' is true, then the consequence 'Lucy went to the zoo' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about what happens if 'Joe went to the park' is false.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is indeed true. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Joe did not go to the park.\n- Lucy went to the zoo for a different reason, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nIn this scenario, both given statements are still true, but 'Joe went to the park' is false.\n\nTherefore, just because 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Joe went to the park' must be true. The given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that 'Joe went to the park' is definitely true.\n\nAnswer: no"
