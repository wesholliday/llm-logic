            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. This is a conditional statement. Let's call this statement (1).\n\n2) We are also given that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. Let's call this statement (2).\n\n3) Now, statement (1) is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). In a conditional, if the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is true, we cannot conclude anything definite about the antecedent (the part after the \"if\"). \n\n4) In this case, statement (2) affirms the consequent of statement (1). That is, it states that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, which is the consequent of the conditional in statement (1).\n\n5) However, just because the consequent of a conditional is true, we cannot conclude that the antecedent must also be true. Mark could have bought the blue shirt for any number of reasons, not necessarily because Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n6) Therefore, we do not have enough information to conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is definitely true.\n\nAnswer: no"
