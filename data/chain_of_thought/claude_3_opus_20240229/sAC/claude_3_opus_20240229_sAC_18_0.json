            "content": "To determine if 'The doll was plastic' must be true, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true.\n2. 'The truck was metal' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'the doll was plastic' is true, then the consequence 'the truck was metal' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about the reverse case - if the truck was metal, it doesn't necessarily mean the doll was plastic.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'The truck was metal' is indeed true. However, this doesn't give us any information about the material of the doll.\n\nConsider these possibilities:\n- The doll could have been plastic, and that would make both statements true.\n- The doll could have been made of another material (like cloth or wood), and the truck could still be metal, making the second statement true but the first statement irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, while 'The doll was plastic' could be true, it is not necessarily true based on the given information. The truth of 'The truck was metal' does not imply the truth of 'The doll was plastic' in this case.\n\nAnswer: no"
