We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\"\n   - \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\"\n\n2. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It says that one of two possibilities must be true: either the cookies are in the jar, or they are hidden in the pantry.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. It says that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\n4. If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\n5. The only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\n6. Therefore, if we accept the truth of both given statements, we must infer that the cookies are in the jar. There is no other possibility remaining.\n\nAnswer: yes"
