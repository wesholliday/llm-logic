These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the notebook.\n\n5) With one option eliminated, and given that the first statement presented these as the only two options, we are left to conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
