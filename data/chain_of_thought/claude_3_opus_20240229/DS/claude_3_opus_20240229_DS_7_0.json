It can't be in both places at once, and these are the only two possibilities given.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4) If the umbrella is not in the closet, and the only other possibility given is that it's in the car, then we can indeed infer that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\n5) This is a valid inference based on the information provided. If the umbrella must be either in the car or in the closet, and we know it's not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
