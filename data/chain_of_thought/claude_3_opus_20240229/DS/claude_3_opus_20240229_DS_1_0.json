These are presented as the only two possibilities, and they are mutually exclusive (Fido can't be both inside and in the garden at the same time).\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n4) If Fido is not in the garden, and being in the garden was one of only two possibilities, then the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if Fido is not in the garden, Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
