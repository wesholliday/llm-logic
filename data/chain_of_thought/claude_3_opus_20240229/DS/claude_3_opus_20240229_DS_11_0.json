It can't be both, and it must be one of these two places.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It tells us that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n4) So, if the newspaper must be either in the driveway or on the porch (from statement a), and it's not on the porch (from statement b), then there's only one possibility left: it must be in the driveway.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
