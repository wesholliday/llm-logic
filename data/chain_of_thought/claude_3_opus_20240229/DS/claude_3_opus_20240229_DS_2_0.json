These are presented as the only two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the book is not resting on the table.\n\n4) So, if we know that one of the two possibilities must be true, and we also know that one of those possibilities is not true, then the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the book isn't resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
