It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the milk is on the counter, or the milk is in the fridge. It can't be both, and it must be one of these.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\n4) So, if the milk must be either on the counter or in the fridge (first statement), and it's not in the fridge (second statement), then there's only one possibility left: the milk must be on the counter.\n\n5) This is a valid inference. If we assume the two given statements are true, then we can logically conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
