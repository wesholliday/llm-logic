These are presented as the only two possibilities.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the jacket is not in the closet.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\n5) Therefore, if the jacket is not in the closet, and the only other possibility is that it's on the chair, then we can indeed infer that the jacket must be on the chair.\n\n6) This is a valid inference based on the given statements and the logical structure of the first statement (it presents an either/or situation).\n\nAnswer: yes"
