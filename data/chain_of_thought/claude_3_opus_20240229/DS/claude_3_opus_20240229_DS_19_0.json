These are the only two possibilities given.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n4) If the watch is not on his wrist, and the only other possibility given is that it's charging on the dresser, then we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\n5) This is a valid inference based on the information provided. If we assume the two given statements are true, then the conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
