It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the shoes are in the closet, or they are lined up by the door.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It states that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n4) If we know that one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other possibility must be true. This is because the disjunction states that at least one of the possibilities is true.\n\n5) In this case, we know that \"the shoes are lined up by the door\" is false. Therefore, the other possibility, \"the shoes are in the closet\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
