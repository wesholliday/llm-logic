These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: it states that the toy is not on the shelf.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the toy.\n\n5) With one option eliminated, and given that the first statement presented these as the only two possibilities, we are left to conclude that the other possibility must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the premises, we can indeed infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
