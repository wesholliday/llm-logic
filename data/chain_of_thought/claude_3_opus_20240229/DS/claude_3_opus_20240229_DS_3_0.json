In other words, the keys are either in the drawer, or they are dangling in the cabinet, or both.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the second part of the disjunction in (a). It states that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\n4) If we combine the information from (a) and (b), we can conclude:\n   - The keys must be either in the drawer or in the cabinet (from a)\n   - The keys are not in the cabinet (from b)\n\n5) Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
