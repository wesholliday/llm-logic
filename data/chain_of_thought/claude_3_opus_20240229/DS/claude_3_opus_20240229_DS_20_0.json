These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the sunglasses.\n\n5) With one option eliminated, and given that the first statement presents these as the only two options, we are left to conclude that the other option must be true: the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the truth of both given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
