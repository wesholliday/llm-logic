That means if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) The specific content of the premises (about Lisa and Mark and shirts) doesn't matter for determining validity. Validity is about the form of the argument.\n\n5) Since this argument has the form of Modus Ponens, and Modus Ponens is a valid form of argument, this specific argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
