This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) The specific content of the premises (griffins, unicorns, forests) doesn't matter for determining logical validity. We're only concerned with the form or structure of the argument.\n\n5) Since this argument has the form of Modus Ponens, and Modus Ponens is a valid form of argument, this specific argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
