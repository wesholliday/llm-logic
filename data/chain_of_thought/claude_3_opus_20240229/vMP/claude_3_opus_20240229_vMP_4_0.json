In other words, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\n4) The validity of an argument form does not depend on the actual content of the propositions, but on the structure of the argument. \n\n5) Since this argument has the structure of Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument, the argument is logically valid regardless of whether the premises are actually true or not.\n\nAnswer: yes"
