That means if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = The dog was inside\n   Q = The cat was outside\n\n5) The argument is saying:\n   If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (Premise 1)\n   The dog was inside. (Premise 2)\n   Therefore, the cat was outside. (Conclusion)\n\n6) This follows the Modus Ponens form exactly. So if we assume the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\n7) Therefore, this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
