            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: P\n   Conclusion: Therefore, Q\n\n2) This is a well-known form of argument called Modus Ponens. \n\n3) Modus Ponens is considered a valid form of argument in propositional logic. That means if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = Tom watched football\n   Q = Jen watched basketball\n\n   The argument is saying:\n   If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Premise 1)\n   Tom watched football. (Premise 2)\n   Therefore, Jen watched basketball. (Conclusion)\n\n5) If we assume the premises are true (i.e., the conditional statement in Premise 1 is true, and Premise 2 is also true), then the conclusion must be true according to the rules of Modus Ponens.\n\n6) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
