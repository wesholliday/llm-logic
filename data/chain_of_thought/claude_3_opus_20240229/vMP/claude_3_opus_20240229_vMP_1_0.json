That means if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) The validity of an argument form does not depend on the specific content of the premises and conclusion, but on the structure of the argument.\n\n5) Since this argument has the structure of Modus Ponens, which is a valid form, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
