If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n5) The argument is saying:\n   If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (Premise 1)\n   Joe did go to the park. (Premise 2)\n   Therefore, Lucy went to the zoo. (Conclusion)\n\n6) If the premises are true (i.e., if it's true that Joe going to the park always means Lucy goes to the zoo, and it's true that Joe did go to the park), then it must necessarily be true that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n7) The validity of the argument doesn't depend on whether Joe actually went to the park or whether Lucy actually went to the zoo in reality. It's about the logical structure of the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
