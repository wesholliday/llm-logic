If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) So, if it's true that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\", and it's also true that \"Sue chose pizza\", then it must necessarily be true that \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\n5) The specific content of the premises doesn't matter for determining validity. What matters is the form of the argument. And this form (Modus Ponens) is valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
