That means if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) The specific content of the premises (cake being chocolate, muffins being blueberry) doesn't matter for determining validity. Validity is about the form of the argument, not the content.\n\n5) Since this argument has the form of Modus Ponens, and Modus Ponens is a valid argument form, this specific argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
