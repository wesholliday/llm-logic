            "content": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: P\n   Conclusion: Therefore, Q\n\n2) This is a well-known argument form called Modus Ponens. \n\n3) Modus Ponens is considered a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   Q = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n5) The argument is of the form:\n   If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n   The doll was plastic. (Premise 2)\n   Therefore, the truck was metal. (Conclusion)\n\n6) This is a valid instance of Modus Ponens. If the premises are true (i.e., if it's true that \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and it's also true that \"the doll was plastic\"), then the conclusion must be true (i.e., it must be true that \"the truck was metal\").\n\n7) The validity of the argument doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. Modus Ponens is a valid form, so any argument of this form is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
