For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) In this case, we don't have enough information to infer the converse. It's possible that the smonk could plag for reasons other than being vreebled.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
