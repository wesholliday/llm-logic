Just because P implies Q, it doesn't necessarily mean that Q implies P.\n\n4) For example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". This is true, but its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler).\n\n5) Similarly, in this case, just because we know that if the twonk was plinked, it was varnished, we can't infer that if it was varnished, it must have been plinked. It could have been varnished without being plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
