For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) Therefore, without additional information, we cannot infer the converse statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: no"
