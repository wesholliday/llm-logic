For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) In this case, we don't have enough information to infer the converse. It's possible that the sneg could sprote the frink for reasons other than being crampled.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
