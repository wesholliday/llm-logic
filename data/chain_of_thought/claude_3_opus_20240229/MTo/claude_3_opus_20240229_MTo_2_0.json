            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The unicorn was not in the forest\"\n   - \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the griffin was in the forest, then it necessarily follows that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that the unicorn was not in the forest. \n\n4) If the griffin were in the forest, then according to the second statement, the unicorn would have to be in the forest too. But this contradicts the first statement.\n\n5) Therefore, for both statements to be true, it must be the case that the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
