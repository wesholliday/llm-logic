            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it cannot be.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is false, \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
