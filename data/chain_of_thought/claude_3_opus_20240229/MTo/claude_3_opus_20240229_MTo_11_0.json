            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The muffins were not blueberry\"\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the cake was chocolate, then it necessarily follows that the muffins were blueberry.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that the muffins were not blueberry. This directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it isn't in this case (we are assuming both given statements are true).\n\n5) Therefore, since the consequent (\"the muffins were blueberry\") is false, the antecedent (\"the cake was chocolate\") must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
