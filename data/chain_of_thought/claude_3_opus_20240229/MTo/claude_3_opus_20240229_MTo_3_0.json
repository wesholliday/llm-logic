It states that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. \n\n3) However, from the first statement, we know that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n4) So, if James had written the book, it would be a mystery novel (from the second statement). But it's not a mystery novel (from the first statement).\n\n5) The only way to resolve this apparent contradiction is if the condition in the second statement (James wrote the book) is false. \n\n6) Therefore, we can indeed infer that James did not write the book. If he had, it would be a mystery novel, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
