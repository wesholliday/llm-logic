            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck was not blue\"\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the car was red, it necessarily means the truck was blue.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that the truck was not blue. This contradicts the consequent of the second statement.\n\n4) In a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent is false. For example, in the statement \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\", if the ground is not wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it's not raining (the ground could be dry for other reasons).\n\n5) Similarly, in this case, just because the truck is not blue, it doesn't necessarily mean the car is not red. The car could be red, and the second statement could simply be false.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer from these statements that the car was not red. The car could be red or not red, we don't have enough information to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no"
