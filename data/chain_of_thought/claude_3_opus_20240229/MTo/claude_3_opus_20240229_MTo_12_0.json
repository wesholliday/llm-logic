            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\"\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\". This means that the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) In a conditional statement, if the consequence is false, we cannot determine whether the condition is true or false. The condition could be either true or false, and the conditional statement would still be true.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether or not Joe went to the park. He may have gone to the park or he may not have, but we don't have enough information to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no"
