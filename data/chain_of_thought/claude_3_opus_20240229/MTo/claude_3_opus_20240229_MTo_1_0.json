            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Sue was not at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"Sue was not at the wedding\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it isn't in this case.\n\n5) Therefore, since the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" is false, the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
