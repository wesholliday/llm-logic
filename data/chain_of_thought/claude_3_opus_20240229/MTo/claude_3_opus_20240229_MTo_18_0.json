            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck was not metal\"\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the doll was plastic, then it necessarily follows that the truck was metal.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that the truck was not metal. This directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, we can infer that the antecedent must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n5) Applying this to our conditional statement: since \"the truck was metal\" is false, we can infer that \"the doll was plastic\" must also be false.\n\n6) Therefore, we can indeed infer from these two statements that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
