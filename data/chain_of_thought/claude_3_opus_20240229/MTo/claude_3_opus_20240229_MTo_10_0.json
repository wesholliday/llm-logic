It states that if the dog was inside, then it necessarily follows that the cat was outside.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"The cat was not outside\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) If the consequence of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth of the antecedent (the \"if\" part). The conditional statement as a whole is still true, because it's not asserting that the dog was inside, only that if it was, then the cat would be outside.\n\n5) Therefore, given that the cat was not outside, we cannot infer anything about whether the dog was inside or not. The dog could have been inside or outside, we don't have enough information to determine which.\n\nAnswer: no"
