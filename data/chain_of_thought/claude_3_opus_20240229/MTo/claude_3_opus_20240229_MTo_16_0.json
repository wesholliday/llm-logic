            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The pants were not denim\"\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the consequence \"the pants were denim\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"the pants were not denim\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it isn't in this case.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the pants were denim\" is false, \"the shirt was cotton\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can infer that \"the shirt was not cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
