It states that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"Erin did not take a train\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) If the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it isn't in this case.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"Erin took a train\" is false, \"Sam took a plane\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
