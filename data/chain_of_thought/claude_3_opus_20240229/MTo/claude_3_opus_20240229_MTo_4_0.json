It states that if the alien visited Mars, it necessarily follows that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that the robot did not visit Jupiter. \n\n4) So, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then according to the second statement, it cannot be the case that the alien visited Mars. If the alien had visited Mars, the robot would have had to visit Jupiter, which contradicts the first statement.\n\n5) Therefore, we can indeed infer that the alien did not visit Mars. If it had, it would contradict the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
