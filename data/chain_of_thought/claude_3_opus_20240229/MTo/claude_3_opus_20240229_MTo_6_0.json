            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Bob did not choose pasta\"\n   - \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"Bob did not choose pasta\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, if a conditional statement is true, and its consequence is false, then its condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it's not according to our given information.\n\n5) Therefore, since the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" is false, the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" must also be false for the conditional statement to remain true.\n\n6) In other words, Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
