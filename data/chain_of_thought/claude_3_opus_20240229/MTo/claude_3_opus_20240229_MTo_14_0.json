It states that if the bear was in the cave, then it necessarily follows that the wolf was in the den.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that the wolf was not in the den. \n\n4) So, if the bear was in the cave, it would mean the wolf was in the den (from the second statement). But this contradicts the first statement.\n\n5) Therefore, for the first statement to be true, it must be the case that the bear was not in the cave. If the bear was in the cave, it would lead to a contradiction.\n\n6) So, we can indeed infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
