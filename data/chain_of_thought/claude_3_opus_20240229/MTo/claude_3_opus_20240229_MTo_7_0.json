It states that if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, then the consequence \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"Chris did not finish the race\". This contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, when the consequence of a conditional statement is false, we can infer that the condition must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"Chris finished the race\" is false, we can infer that \"Alex finished the race\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
