            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"Jen did not watch basketball\"\n   - \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\n3. However, we know from the first statement that \"Jen did not watch basketball\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4. If the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be invalid.\n\n5. Therefore, since \"Jen watched basketball\" is false, \"Tom watched football\" must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true.\n\n6. In other words, we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
