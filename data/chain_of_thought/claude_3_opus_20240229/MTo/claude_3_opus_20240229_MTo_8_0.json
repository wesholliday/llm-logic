            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The mummy was not awake\"\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It tells us that if the vampire was awake, it would necessarily mean the mummy was also awake. \n\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the mummy was in fact not awake.\n\n4. So, if the vampire had been awake, it would have implied the mummy was awake too (by the second statement). But this would contradict the first statement.\n\n5. Therefore, in order for both statements to be true simultaneously, it must be the case that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire had been awake, it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nSo, yes, we can logically infer from these two statements that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire had been awake, it would mean the mummy was awake, but we know the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
