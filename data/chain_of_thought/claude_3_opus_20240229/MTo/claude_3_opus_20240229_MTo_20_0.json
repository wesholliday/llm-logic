            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The banana was not yellow\"\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the apple being red is true, then it necessarily follows that the banana is yellow.\n\n3) However, we are told in the first statement that the banana was not yellow. This directly contradicts the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the second statement.\n\n4) If the consequent of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the antecedent (the \"if\" part)? \n\n5) In logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\". It states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\n6) Applying this rule here: if \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true (which we are told it is), and \"the banana was yellow\" is false (which we are also told), then \"the apple was red\" must also be false.\n\n7) In other words, \"the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
