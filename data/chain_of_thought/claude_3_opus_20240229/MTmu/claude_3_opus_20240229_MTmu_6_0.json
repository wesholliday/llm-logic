            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\"\n   - \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the consequence \"Bob must have chosen pasta\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Bob must have chosen pasta\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens here:\n   - The conditional \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"Bob must have chosen pasta\" is false (as per the second statement).\n   - Therefore, the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" must also be false.\n\n6) If \"Sue chose pizza\" is false, that means \"Sue did not choose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
