            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". We can represent this as:\n   Lisa bought red shirt \u2192 Mark bought blue shirt\n\n2) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". In other words:\n   \u00ac(Mark bought blue shirt)\n\n3) Now, we're asked if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from these two statements. In logical terms, this would be:\n   \u00ac(Lisa bought red shirt)\n\n4) This is a case of denying the consequent. If we have a conditional statement (If P then Q), and we also know that Q is false, we can indeed conclude that P must also be false.\n\n5) Applying that here: since the conditional is true (statement 1), and the consequent is false (statement 2), we can conclude that the antecedent must also be false. That is, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
