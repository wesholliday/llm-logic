            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\"\n   - \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy must have played tennis\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Amy must have played tennis\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens here:\n   - The conditional \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"Amy must have played tennis\" is false (as per the second statement).\n   - Therefore, the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
