            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the consequence \"the pants must have been denim\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the pants must have been denim\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens here:\n   - The conditional \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"the pants must have been denim\" is false (as per the second statement).\n   - Therefore, the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" must also be false.\n\n6) So, yes, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
