            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It says that if the doll was plastic, it necessarily follows that the truck was metal.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It says that it's not necessarily true that the truck was metal.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens which says:\n   If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\n5) In this case:\n   - P is \"the doll was plastic\"\n   - Q is \"the truck must have been metal\"\n\n6) We know that Q is false (from the second statement).\n\n7) Therefore, by modus tollens, P must also be false.\n\n8) In other words, \"the doll was plastic\" must be false, which means the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
