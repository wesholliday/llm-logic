            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the car was red\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck must have been blue\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the conclusion of the first statement. It states that \"the truck must have been blue\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the conclusion of the conditional is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The conclusion \"the truck must have been blue\" is false (according to the second statement).\n   - Therefore, the condition \"the car was red\" must also be false.\n\n6) So, we can indeed infer that \"The car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
