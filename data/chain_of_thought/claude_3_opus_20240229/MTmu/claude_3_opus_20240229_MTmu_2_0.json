            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the griffin was in the forest, then it necessarily follows that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It states that it's not necessarily true that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n4) Now, in logic, there's a rule called \"modus tollens\". It states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\", and we also know \"not Q\", then we can infer \"not P\".\n\n5) In this case, P is \"the griffin was in the forest\", and Q is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\".\n\n6) We have \"if P then Q\" from the first statement, and \"not Q\" from the second statement. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can infer \"not P\", which is \"the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
