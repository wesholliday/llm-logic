            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n   - \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue must have been at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Sue must have been at the wedding\" is not true.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional, if the consequence is false, we cannot determine whether the condition is true or false. The condition could be either true or false, and the conditional would still hold.\n\n5) Therefore, just because \"Sue must have been at the wedding\" is not true, we cannot infer anything about whether \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true or false.\n\n6) We don't have enough information to determine whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
