            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\"\n   - \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin must have taken a train\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Erin must have taken a train\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens here:\n   - The conditional \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"Erin must have taken a train\" is false (as per the second statement).\n   - Therefore, the condition \"Sam took a plane\" must also be false.\n\n6) If \"Sam took a plane\" is false, that means \"Sam did not take a plane\" is true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
