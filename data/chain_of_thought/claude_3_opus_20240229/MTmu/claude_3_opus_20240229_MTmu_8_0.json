            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It says that if the vampire was awake, then it necessarily follows that the mummy was awake.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It says that it's not necessarily true that the mummy was awake.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens. It says that if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\", and we also know \"not Q\", then we can infer \"not P\".\n\n5) In this case:\n   - P is \"the vampire was awake\"\n   - Q is \"the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n6) We have \"If P then Q\" from the first statement, and \"not Q\" from the second statement. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can infer \"not P\", which is \"the vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
