            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\"\n   - \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen must have watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Jen must have watched basketball\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"Jen must have watched basketball\" is false (as per the second statement).\n   - Therefore, the condition \"Tom watched football\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"Tom did not watch football\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
