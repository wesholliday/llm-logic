            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the apple was red, then it necessarily follows that the banana was yellow.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It states that it's not necessarily true that the banana was yellow.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\", and we also know \"not Q\", then we can infer \"not P\".\n\n5) In this case:\n   - P is \"the apple was red\"\n   - Q is \"the banana must have been yellow\"\n\n6) We have \"If P then Q\" from the first statement, and \"not Q\" from the second statement. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can infer \"not P\", which is \"the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
