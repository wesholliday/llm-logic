            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The meeting might be in the conference room,\" only provides information about the possible location of the meeting. It does not mention anything about the time of the meeting. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The meeting might be at 2 PM and in the conference room\" based solely on the given information. Adding the time \"2 PM\" to the statement is an additional piece of information that is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
