            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application might include references\" does not provide enough information to infer that \"The application might be completed online and include references\". \n\nThe original statement only mentions that the application might include references, but it does not specify the mode of completing the application (online or offline). It is possible that the application is completed on paper and still includes references.\n\nTo infer that the application might be completed online, we would need additional information or context suggesting that the application process is or can be done online. However, the given statement alone does not imply this.\n\nTherefore, based on the limited information provided, we cannot logically conclude that \"The application might be completed online and include references\".\n\nAnswer: no"
