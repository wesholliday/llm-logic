However, this statement alone does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam.\n\nInferring that \"The exam might be difficult and cover all chapters\" introduces an additional piece of information about the exam's difficulty, which is not directly supported by the original statement. While it is possible that an exam covering all chapters could be difficult, this is not necessarily always the case. The difficulty of an exam depends on various factors such as the complexity of the content, the type of questions asked, and the individual's preparation level.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the exam will be difficult solely based on the fact that it might cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no"
