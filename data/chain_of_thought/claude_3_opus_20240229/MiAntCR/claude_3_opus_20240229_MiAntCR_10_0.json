            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be notarized', we need to consider the relationship between being notarized and being signed.\n\nWhen a document is notarized, it means that a notary public has witnessed the signing of the document and has verified the identity of the person signing it. The notary then applies their official seal or stamp to the document to confirm that the notarization process has been completed.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that if a document is notarized, it must have been signed by the person whose signature is being notarized. The notarization process inherently includes the signing of the document.\n\nTherefore, if 'The document might be notarized', it logically follows that 'The document might be signed and notarized', as the notarization process includes signing.\n\nAnswer: yes"
