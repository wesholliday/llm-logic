            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be signed for\" does not necessarily imply that the package will be delivered today. Signing for a package is a separate event from the package being delivered. The package could be signed for on a different day than when it is delivered, depending on factors such as the delivery service, the recipient's availability, and any delivery instructions or requirements.\n\nWhile it's possible that the package might be both delivered and signed for today, we cannot logically infer or guarantee this based solely on the given statement. The statement only mentions the possibility of the package being signed for, without specifying when the delivery will occur.\n\nAnswer: no"
