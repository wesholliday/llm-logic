            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer that 'The flimble might be wobble and grooble' from the statement 'The flimble might be grooble'. The original statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the flimble has the property of being grooble. It does not say anything about the flimble potentially being wobble. Introducing the additional possibility of the flimble being wobble goes beyond what can be validly inferred from the initial statement alone. We would need additional information to conclude that the flimble might be both wobble and grooble.\n\nAnswer: no"
