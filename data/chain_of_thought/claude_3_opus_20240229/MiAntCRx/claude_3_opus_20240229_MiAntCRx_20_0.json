The original statement only tells us that the blurble has the potential to floob. It says nothing about the blurble's ability or potential to plimp. Introducing 'plimp' in the inference is adding new information that is not supported by the original statement. We can only infer things that are directly supported by or logically follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
