            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer that \"The zazzle might quibble and fizzle\" from the given statement \"The zazzle might fizzle\". The original statement only tells us that there is a possibility the zazzle will fizzle. It says nothing about quibbling. So adding the claim that the zazzle might also quibble is adding new information that is not contained or implied by the original statement. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
