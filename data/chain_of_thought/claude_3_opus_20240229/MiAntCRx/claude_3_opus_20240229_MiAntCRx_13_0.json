            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer 'The wobble might wump and zibber' from the given statement 'The wobble might zibber'. The original statement tells us that the wobble has the potential to zibber. However, it does not provide any information about the wobble's potential to wump. Introducing the additional possibility of wumping goes beyond what can be validly inferred from the initial statement alone. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
