            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer that 'The grazzle might wibble and quazzle' from the given statement 'The grazzle might quazzle'. The original statement only tells us that there is a possibility the grazzle will quazzle. It says nothing about wibbling. So we have no basis to conclude the grazzle might also wibble in addition to quazzling. Introducing the idea of wibbling goes beyond what can be validly inferred from the information provided in the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
