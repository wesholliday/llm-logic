However, these possibilities are not necessarily connected or occurring simultaneously.\n\nThe inferred statement, \"The concert might be cancelled and rescheduled,\" suggests that both events (cancellation and rescheduling) could happen together. This is not a valid inference because the original statement does not imply that the cancellation and rescheduling will occur in conjunction with each other.\n\nIt is possible that the concert might be cancelled without being rescheduled, or it might be rescheduled without being cancelled. The original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that both events will happen together.\n\nAnswer: no"
