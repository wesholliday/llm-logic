There is a possibility it didn't happen.\n\n4) If there's a possibility it didn't happen, then it can't be the case that it must have happened. \"Must have happened\" implies certainty, which is contradicted by the original statement.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer from \"The twonk might not have been plinked\" that \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\". If plinked is not certain, then it can't be said that it must have happened.\n\nAnswer: yes"
