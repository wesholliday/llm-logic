In other words, it leaves open the possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n3) Now let's consider the statement we're trying to infer: \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\".\n4) Saying something \"must have\" happened means it definitely happened, there's no possibility it didn't happen. \n5) The negation of that, \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\", means there's a possibility the zinger was not fraggled.\n6) This matches the meaning we determined for the original statement in step 2 - that it's possible the zinger was not fraggled.\n7) Therefore, the inference holds. From \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\", we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
