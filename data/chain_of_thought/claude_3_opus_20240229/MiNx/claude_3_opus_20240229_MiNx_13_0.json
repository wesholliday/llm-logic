There's no possibility that it wasn't slogged.\n\n4) The negation of this, \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\", means that it's not necessarily true that the glip was slogged. There's a possibility that it wasn't slogged.\n\n5) This is exactly what the original statement is saying - there's a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\n6) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from \"The glip might not have been slogged\". The two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
