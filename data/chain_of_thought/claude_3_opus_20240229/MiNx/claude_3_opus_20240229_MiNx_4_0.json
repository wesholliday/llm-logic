This means there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\n2) The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\". \n\n3) \"Must have been\" implies necessity or certainty. If something must have happened, then there is no possibility that it didn't happen.\n\n4) The original statement allows for the possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. This directly contradicts the idea that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's possible that the fribble was not snurgled, then it cannot be the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
