This means there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked.\n\n2) The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\". \n\n3) \"Must have been\" implies certainty or necessity. If something must have happened, then there is no possibility that it didn't happen.\n\n4) The original statement allows for the possibility that the clug was not fleeked. This directly contradicts the idea that the clug must have been fleeked.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's possible that the clug was not fleeked (as stated in the original sentence), then it cannot be the case that the clug must have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
