If something must have happened, then it definitely happened, with no possibility that it didn't happen.\n\n4) The original statement allows for the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed. This directly contradicts the idea that the grommet must have been sploffed.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's possible that the grommet was not sploffed, then it cannot be the case that the grommet must have been sploffed. The possibility of it not being sploffed negates the certainty of it being sploffed.\n\n6) So, from \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\", we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
