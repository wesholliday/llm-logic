It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (If P then Q)\n   It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Joe did not go to the park. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly. Therefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n5) So, the form of this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
