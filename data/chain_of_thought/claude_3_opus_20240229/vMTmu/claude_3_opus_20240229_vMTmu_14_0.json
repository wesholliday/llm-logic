It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P, then Q\") is accepted, and the consequent does not hold (not-Q), then the negation of the antecedent (not-P) can be inferred.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = The bear was in the cave\n   Q = The wolf must have been in the den\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. (If P, then Q)\n   It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the bear was not in the cave. (Not P)\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
