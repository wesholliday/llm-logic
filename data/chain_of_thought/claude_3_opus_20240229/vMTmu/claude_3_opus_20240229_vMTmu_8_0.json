            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not P\n\n2) This is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens, or denying the consequent. It says that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   Q = \"the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n   So the argument is saying:\n   If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n   It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n   Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\n4) This follows the valid modus tollens form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nSo, is the argument form valid? Yes, it is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
