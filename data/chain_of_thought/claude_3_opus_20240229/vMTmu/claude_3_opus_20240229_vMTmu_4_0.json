It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P, then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"the alien visited Mars\"\n   Q = \"the robot must have visited Jupiter\"\n\n   The argument is saying:\n   If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n   It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n   Therefore, the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n4) This follows the modus tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
