            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Not P\n\n2) This is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens, or denying the consequent. \n\n3) In modus tollens, if the first premise is true (i.e., P really does imply Q), and the second premise is also true (i.e., Q is indeed false), then the conclusion (not P) must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"the car was red\"\n   Q = \"the truck must have been blue\"\n\n5) The first premise states that P implies Q. The second premise states that Q is false. Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must also be false, which is exactly what the conclusion states.\n\n6) So, the argument follows a logically valid form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
