It states that if a conditional statement is true (If P then Q), and the consequent does not hold (not Q), then the negation of the antecedent (not P) must follow.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = Tom watched football\n   Q = Jen must have watched basketball\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. (If P then Q)\n   It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Tom did not watch football. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This follows the modus tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
