It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is accepted, and the consequent does not hold (not-Q), then the negation of the antecedent (not-P) can be inferred.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = Sue chose pizza\n   Q = Bob must have chosen pasta\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. (If P then Q)\n   It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza. (Therefore, Not P)\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
