Premise 1 doesn't just say \"If P, then Q\", it says \"If P, then necessarily Q\". \n\n4) The negation in Premise 2 is of \"necessarily Q\", not just of Q.\n\n5) So the argument is actually of the form:\n   If P, then necessarily Q\n   Not necessarily Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n6) This form of argument is not valid in standard propositional logic. Just because Q is not necessarily true, it doesn't mean it's false. Q could still be contingently true, in which case we can't conclude that P is false.\n\n7) Therefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
