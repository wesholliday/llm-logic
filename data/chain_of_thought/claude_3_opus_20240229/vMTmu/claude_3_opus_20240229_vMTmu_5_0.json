It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy must have played tennis\"\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. (If P then Q)\n   It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
