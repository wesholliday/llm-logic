It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Alex finished the race\"\n   Q = \"Chris must have finished the race\"\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. (If P then Q)\n   It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Alex did not finish the race. (Therefore, Not P)\n\n4) This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
