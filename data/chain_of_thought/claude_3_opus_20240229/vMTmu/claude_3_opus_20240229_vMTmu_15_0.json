It says that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = Sam took a plane\n   Q = Erin must have taken a train\n\n4) The argument is saying:\n   If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. (If P, then Q)\n   It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Sam did not take a plane. (Therefore, not P)\n\n5) This follows the valid modus tollens form exactly.\n\nTherefore, yes, this argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
