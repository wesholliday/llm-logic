It says that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = The cake was chocolate\n   Q = The muffins must have been blueberry\n\n4) The argument is saying:\n   If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n   It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n   Therefore, the cake was not chocolate.\n\n5) This follows the modus tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
