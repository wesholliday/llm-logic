            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not P\n\n2) This is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens, or denying the consequent. \n\n3) In modus tollens, if the first premise is true (i.e., P really does imply Q), and the second premise is also true (i.e., Q is indeed false), then the conclusion (not P) must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   Q = \"the pants must have been denim\"\n\n   Premise 1 states that P implies Q.\n   Premise 2 states that Q is false.\n   The conclusion states that P is false.\n\n5) This follows the exact structure of modus tollens. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
