It says that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = The book was written by James\n   Q = The book must be a mystery novel\n\n   The argument is saying:\n   If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n   It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n   Therefore, the book was not written by James.\n\n4) This follows the modus tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, this is a valid form of argument. The validity of an argument doesn't depend on the truth of the premises, but on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, it does.\n\nAnswer: yes"
