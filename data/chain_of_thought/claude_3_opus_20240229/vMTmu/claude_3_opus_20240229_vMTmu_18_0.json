It says that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = The doll was plastic\n   Q = The truck must have been metal\n\n4) The argument is saying:\n   If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. (If P, then Q)\n   It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the doll was not plastic. (Not P)\n\n5) This follows the valid modus tollens form exactly.\n\nTherefore, yes, this argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
