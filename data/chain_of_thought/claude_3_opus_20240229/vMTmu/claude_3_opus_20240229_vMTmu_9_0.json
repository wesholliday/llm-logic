The general structure of Modus Tollens is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n4) So, the given argument, which has the form of Modus Tollens, is indeed a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
