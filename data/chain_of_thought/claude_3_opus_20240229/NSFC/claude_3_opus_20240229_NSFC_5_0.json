            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Sarah might study biology or chemistry\" uses the word \"or,\" which in logic is typically interpreted as an inclusive disjunction. This means that at least one of the options must be true, but both could be true as well.\n\nWhen we break down the statement into \"Sarah might study biology\" and \"Sarah might study chemistry,\" we are essentially saying that each of these options is independently possible. Sarah has the possibility of studying biology, and she also has the possibility of studying chemistry.\n\nThe original statement does not exclude the possibility of Sarah studying both subjects. It simply states that she will study at least one of them. Therefore, it is valid to infer that \"Sarah might study biology and Sarah might study chemistry\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
