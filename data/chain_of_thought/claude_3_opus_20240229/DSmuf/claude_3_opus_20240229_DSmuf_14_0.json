It says that it's not true that the milk must be in the fridge.\n\n4) In logic, when we have a disjunction (P or Q), and we negate one of the disjuncts (not P), we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (therefore Q).\n\n5) Applying this to our statements:\n   - The milk is either in the fridge or on the counter (P or Q)\n   - It's not the case that the milk must be in the fridge (not P)\n   - Therefore, the milk must be on the counter (therefore Q)\n\n6) So yes, from the given statements, we can validly infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
