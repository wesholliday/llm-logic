In other words, the book is either on the table or on the shelf, but not both and not neither.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the first possibility in the disjunction. It states that it is not necessarily true that the book is on the table.\n\n4) However, statement (b) does not completely rule out the possibility of the book being on the table. It just says that it's not necessarily on the table.\n\n5) So from (b), we can't conclude that the book is definitely not on the table. It might still be on the table, just not necessarily.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't definitively conclude from these two statements alone that the book must be on the shelf. It could still possibly be on the table.\n\nAnswer: no"
