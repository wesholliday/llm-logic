            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\"\n\n2) The first statement presents an either/or situation. It states that one of two things must be true: either the sunglasses are on her head, or they are in her bag.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of these possibilities. It says that it's not true that the sunglasses must be on her head.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n   - If it's not the case that the sunglasses must be on her head (as per the second statement), \n   - And if the sunglasses must be either on her head or in her bag (as per the first statement),\n   - Then the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n5) This is a valid inference. If we negate one of the two possibilities in an either/or situation, then the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
