In other words, either \"Fido must be in the garden\" is true, or \"Fido is inside\" is true, or both are true.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the first part of the disjunction in (a). It states that \"Fido must be in the garden\" is not true.\n\n4) If we combine the information from (a) and (b), we can conclude:\n   - From (a), at least one part of the disjunction must be true.\n   - From (b), we know that the first part (\"Fido must be in the garden\") is not true.\n   - Therefore, the second part (\"Fido is inside\") must be true, because if it were false, then both parts of the disjunction in (a) would be false, contradicting the meaning of the disjunction.\n\n5) Thus, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
