It's an either/or situation.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. It says that it's not true that the remote must be under the couch.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we're left with only one possibility: the remote is on the coffee table.\n\n5) This is because the first statement said it must be one or the other, and the second statement eliminated one of those options.\n\n6) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. There's no other possibility left.\n\nAnswer: yes"
