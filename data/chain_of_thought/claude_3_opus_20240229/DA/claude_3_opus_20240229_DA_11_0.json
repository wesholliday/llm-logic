            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n   - \"The cake was not chocolate\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the cake was chocolate\" is true, then the consequence \"the muffins were blueberry\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that the condition in the first statement is not true: the cake was not chocolate.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition (or antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth of the consequence (or consequent). \n\n5) In other words, knowing that the cake was not chocolate doesn't tell us anything about whether the muffins were blueberry or not. They could have been blueberry, or they could have been another flavor.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: no"
