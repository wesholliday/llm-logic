It states that Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race. In other words, if Alex did not finish, we cannot conclude anything about whether Chris finished or not.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the condition in the first statement (Alex finishing the race) is not met.\n\n4) Since the condition is not met, we cannot make any conclusion about the result (whether Chris finished the race).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether or not Chris finished the race. The information given is insufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
