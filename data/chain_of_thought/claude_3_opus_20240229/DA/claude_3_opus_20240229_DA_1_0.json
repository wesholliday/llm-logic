            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"Mary was not at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if Mary is not at the wedding, we cannot conclude anything about whether Sue was there or not.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\n4) Combining these two pieces of information, we can see that the condition in the first statement (Mary being at the wedding) is not met. \n\n5) Therefore, the first statement doesn't give us any information about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. Sue could have been at the wedding, or she could have not been at the wedding. We simply can't infer anything about Sue's attendance from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
