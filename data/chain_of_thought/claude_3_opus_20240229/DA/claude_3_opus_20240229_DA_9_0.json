            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". We can represent this as:\n   Lisa bought red shirt \u2192 Mark bought blue shirt\n\n2) The second statement tells us that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". In other words, the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3) In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional is false, the conditional statement is always true, regardless of whether the consequent (the \"then\" part) is true or false. This is known as \"vacuous truth\".\n\n4) So, even though Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can't conclude anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. Mark might have bought the blue shirt, or he might not have - we simply don't have enough information to say.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no"
