            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given the conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\". \n   In logical terms, this can be written as: \"Griffin in forest \u21d2 Unicorn in forest\"\n\n2) We are also given the statement: \"The griffin was not in the forest\". \n   In logical terms, this is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\n3) From the negation of the antecedent, we cannot infer anything about the consequent. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the antecedent is true, not what happens if it's false.\n\n4) For example, consider the statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\". \n   If it's not raining, the ground could still be wet from a previous rain, or from someone watering the plants. So we can't conclude that the ground is not wet just because it's not raining.\n\n5) Similarly, in this case, just because the griffin was not in the forest, we can't conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest. The unicorn could have been in the forest for reasons unrelated to the griffin.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no"
