            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The doll was not plastic\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition (or antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any conclusion about the truth of the consequent. In other words, if \"the doll was plastic\" is false, we cannot conclude anything about whether \"the truck was metal\" is true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The truck was not metal\". The truck could have been metal or not metal, we simply don't have enough information to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no"
