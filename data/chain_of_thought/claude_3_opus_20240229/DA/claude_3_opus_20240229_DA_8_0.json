            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n   - \"The vampire was not awake\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is true, then the consequence \"the mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that \"the vampire was not awake\". This means that the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the consequence. The consequence could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot definitively say whether the mummy was awake or not. The mummy could have been awake for some other reason, or it could have been asleep.\n\n6) We don't have enough information to infer that \"the mummy was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: no"
