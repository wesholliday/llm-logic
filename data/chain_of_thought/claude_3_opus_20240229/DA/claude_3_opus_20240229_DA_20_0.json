            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n   - \"The apple was not red\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that the condition \"the apple was red\" is not true.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition (or antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any conclusion about the truth of the consequence (or consequent). \n\n5) In other words, if the apple was not red, the first statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the banana was yellow or not. The banana could have been yellow, or it could have been any other color.\n\n6) Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow\".\n\nAnswer: no"
