            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given the conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". \n   In logic, this is represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\n2) We are also given the statement: \"Tom did not watch football\". \n   This is the negation of P, represented as \u00acP.\n\n3) The question is, from these two statements, can we infer \"Jen did not watch basketball\", which is the negation of Q (\u00acQ)?\n\n4) To determine this, let's consider the truth table for the implication P \u2192 Q:\n\n   P | Q | P \u2192 Q\n   T | T |   T\n   T | F |   F\n   F | T |   T\n   F | F |   T\n\n5) We are in the situation where P is false (\u00acP). Looking at the last two rows of the truth table, we see that when P is false, the implication P \u2192 Q is always true, regardless of the value of Q.\n\n6) Therefore, the fact that Tom did not watch football (\u00acP) does not allow us to infer anything about whether Jen watched basketball or not. Jen could have watched basketball or not, and the given statements would still be true.\n\nSo, we cannot logically infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
