            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given the conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". \n   In logical terms, this can be written as: \"Joe went to the park\" (p) \u2192 \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (q)\n\n2) We are also given the statement: \"Joe did not go to the park\". \n   This is the negation of p, which we can write as ~p.\n\n3) The question is, from these two statements, can we infer \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\", which would be the negation of q, or ~q?\n\n4) To determine this, let's consider the truth table for the implication p \u2192 q:\n\n   p | q | p \u2192 q\n   --+---+------\n   T | T |   T\n   T | F |   F\n   F | T |   T\n   F | F |   T\n\n5) We are in the situation where p is false (~p). Looking at the last two rows of the truth table, we see that when p is false, q can be either true or false, and the implication p \u2192 q is still true.\n\n6) Therefore, the fact that Joe did not go to the park (~p) does not allow us to infer anything about whether or not Lucy went to the zoo. She could have gone or not gone, and the original implication would still be true.\n\nAnswer: no"
