            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n   - \"The car was not red\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if a certain condition is met (the car being red), then a certain consequence follows (the truck being blue).\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that the condition in the first statement is not met - the car was not red.\n\n4) When the condition in a conditional statement is not met, we cannot make any conclusion about the consequence. The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what color the truck is when the car is not red.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck. It might be blue, or it might not be blue. We simply don't have enough information to say.\n\nAnswer: no"
