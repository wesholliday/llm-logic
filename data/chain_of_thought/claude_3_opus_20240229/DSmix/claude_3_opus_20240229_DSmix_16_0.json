This means that the sneg must be one of these two things - it's either crampled, or it's sproted. It can't be neither, and it can't be both.\n\n2) The second statement says \"The sneg might not be sproted\". This suggests that it's possible that the sneg is not sproted. \n\n3) If the sneg is not sproted, then according to the first statement, it must be crampled. The first statement doesn't allow for the possibility of the sneg being neither crampled nor sproted.\n\n4) Therefore, if we accept that the sneg might not be sproted (as per the second statement), then we must conclude that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
