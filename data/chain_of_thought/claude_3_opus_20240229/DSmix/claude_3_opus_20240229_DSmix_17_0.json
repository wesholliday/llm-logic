This means that the flob has to be one or the other - it's either skizzled, or it's movated. It can't be neither, and it can't be both.\n\n2) The second statement says \"The flob might not be movated\". This suggests that there's a possibility that the flob is not movated. \n\n3) If the flob is not movated, then according to the first statement, it must be skizzled. The first statement doesn't allow for the possibility of the flob being neither skizzled nor movated.\n\n4) Therefore, if we accept that the flob might not be movated (as per the second statement), then we can infer from the first statement that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
