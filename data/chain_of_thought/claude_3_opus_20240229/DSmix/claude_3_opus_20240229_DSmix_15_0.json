This means that the dreb has to be either vroombed or spened, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement says \"The dreb might not be spened\". This means there's a possibility that the dreb is not spened.\n\n3. If the dreb is not spened, then according to the first statement, it must be vroombed, because it has to be one or the other.\n\n4. Therefore, if we know that the dreb might not be spened, we can infer that it is vroombed, because that's the only other option according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
