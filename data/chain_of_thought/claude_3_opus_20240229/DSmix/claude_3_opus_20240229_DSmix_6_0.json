This means that the grommet has to be either sploffed or plopped, but not both. In logic, we call this an \"exclusive or\".\n\n2) The second statement says \"The grommet might not be plopped\". This means there's a possibility that the grommet is not plopped. \n\n3) Now, if the grommet is not plopped, then according to the first statement, it must be sploffed. \n\n4) However, the second statement doesn't say that the grommet is definitely not plopped, only that it might not be. So we can't be absolutely certain that it is sploffed.\n\n5) In other words, while it's possible that the grommet is sploffed, we can't infer this with certainty from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
