It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The wug is flooped\n   - The wug must be bimmed\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible the wug is not bimmed. In other words, it might be false that the wug must be bimmed.\n\n4) If the second part of the disjunction in (1) is possibly false, then in order for the entire disjunction to be true, the first part must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if \"The wug might not be bimmed\" is true, then in order for \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" to also be true, it must be the case that \"The wug is flooped\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
