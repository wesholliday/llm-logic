            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. \n   In logical terms, this is equivalent to: bluttered \u2192 surned\n\n2) The second statement says: It might not have been surned. \n   This means there's a possibility that it was not surned. Let's represent 'not surned' as \u00acsurned.\n\n3) We are asked whether we can infer: The fleeg was not bluttered. \n   Let's represent 'not bluttered' as \u00acbluttered.\n\n4) From (1), we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, it must have been surned. But (2) says it might not have been surned. \n\n5) If it was not surned (\u00acsurned), then according to (1), it could not have been bluttered. Because if it was bluttered, it must have been surned, which contradicts (2).\n\n6) However, (2) only says it MIGHT not have been surned. It doesn't say for certain that it was not surned. There's still a possibility that it was surned, in which case we can't say anything definite about whether it was bluttered or not.\n\n7) Therefore, we can't definitively infer that the fleeg was not bluttered (\u00acbluttered). We can only say that it might not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no"
