            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement can be logically represented as: \n   If A (the sneg was crampled), then B (the sneg must have sproted the frink).\n   In symbolic logic, this is written as: A \u2192 B\n\n2) The second statement says:\n   The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n   This means there's a possibility that B is not true. Let's represent this as \u00acB (not B).\n\n3) Now, we're asked if we can infer from these two statements that:\n   The sneg was not crampled.\n   This is the negation of A, which we can write as \u00acA.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens. It states that if we have A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we can infer \u00acA.\n\n5) However, the second statement in our problem is not exactly \u00acB. It says B might not be true, but it doesn't say B is definitely not true.\n\n6) Therefore, we don't have a definite \u00acB, which means we can't apply modus tollens to infer \u00acA with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
