But the second statement says it's possible that it didn't quank.\n\n5) So, if it's possible that the splat didn't quank, then it must be possible that the splat wasn't morphed. Because if it was definitely morphed, it would have definitely quanked, contradicting the second statement.\n\n6) Therefore, yes, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
