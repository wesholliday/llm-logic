In other words, \"Not Crinked\" is a possibility.\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from these statements.\n\n4) If the fribble was indeed snurgled, then according to the first statement, it must have crinked. \n   But the second statement says that it's possible that the fribble did not crink.\n\n5) So, if the fribble did not crink, then it could not have been snurgled, because if it was snurgled, it must have crinked.\n\n6) Therefore, the possibility that the fribble did not crink (as stated in the second statement) leads to the conclusion that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
