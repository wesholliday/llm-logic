In other words, we can't say for certain that the flugel was zargled.\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\".\n\n4) If the flugel was indeed blimmed, then according to the first statement, it must have been zargled. \n   But the second statement suggests that the flugel might not have been zargled.\n\n5) These two statements are not directly contradictory, because the second statement doesn't say definitively that the flugel was not zargled, only that it might not have been.\n\n6) So, while the statements suggest that the flugel might not have been blimmed, we can't say for certain. The flugel could have been blimmed and zargled, or it could have been neither blimmed nor zargled.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no"
