            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n   - \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it necessarily follows that the sprocket was daggled. In other words, cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for daggling the sprocket.\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible that the sprocket was not daggled. This means that daggling the sprocket is not certain.\n\n4) Now, the question is whether we can infer from these two statements that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\n5) If the sprocket was not daggled (which is possible according to the second statement), then according to the first statement, it cannot be the case that the sprocket was cranked. Because if it was cranked, it must have been daggled, but we know it might not have been daggled.\n\n6) Therefore, if the sprocket might not have been daggled, then it must not have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
