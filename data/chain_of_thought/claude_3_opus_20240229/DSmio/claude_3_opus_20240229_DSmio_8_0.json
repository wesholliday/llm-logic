However, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that it could be under the couch.\n\n3) The second statement presents two possibilities in an \"either-or\" format: the remote is either on the coffee table or under the couch. This statement suggests that these are the only two possible locations for the remote.\n\n4) If we were to infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\", we would need to be certain that it is not under the couch. \n\n5) However, the first statement only suggests that the remote might not be under the couch, but doesn't provide certainty.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\". The remote could still possibly be under the couch, even if it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no"
