However, it doesn't definitively say they are not on her head.\n\n3) The second statement presents an either/or scenario: the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head. There are no other options given.\n\n4) If we were to definitively know that the sunglasses are not on her head, then based on the second statement, we could infer that they must be in her bag.\n\n5) However, the first statement only says the sunglasses \"might not\" be on her head, which leaves open the possibility that they could still be on her head.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot make a definitive inference that the sunglasses are in her bag. The possibility that they are on her head has not been entirely ruled out.\n\nAnswer: no"
