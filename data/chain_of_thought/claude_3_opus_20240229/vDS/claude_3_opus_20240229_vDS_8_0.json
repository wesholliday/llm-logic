This is the definition of a valid argument form.\n\n5) In this specific case:\n   - A is \"The remote control is on the coffee table\"\n   - B is \"The remote control is hiding under the couch\"\n   - The argument follows the valid Disjunctive Syllogism form.\n\n6) Therefore, this specific argument is valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
