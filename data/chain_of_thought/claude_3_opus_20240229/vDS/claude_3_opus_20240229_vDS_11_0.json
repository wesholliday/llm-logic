There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n5) So, regardless of what A and B stand for, as long as the argument has this form, it is valid.\n\n6) In this specific case:\n   A = The newspaper is in the driveway\n   B = The newspaper is sitting on the porch\n\n7) The argument has the correct form of Disjunctive Syllogism, so it is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
