So we can replace A and B with any propositions, and as long as the structure remains the same, the argument will be valid.\n\n4) In this case:\n   A = The milk is on the counter\n   B = The milk is chilling in the fridge\n\n5) The argument follows the valid structure of Disjunctive Syllogism:\n   Premise 1: Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge. (Either A or B)\n   Premise 2: The milk isn't chilling in the fridge. (Not B)\n   Conclusion: Therefore, the milk is on the counter. (Therefore, A)\n\n6) Since the argument has a valid logical form, it is a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
