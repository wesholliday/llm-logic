If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n4) In this case, if it's true that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, and it's also true that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, then it must be true that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is indeed logically valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
