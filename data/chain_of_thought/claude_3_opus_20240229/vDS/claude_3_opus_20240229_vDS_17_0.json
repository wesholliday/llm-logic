If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n5) In the given argument:\n   A = The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\n   B = The scarf is draped on the coat rack\n\n   The argument has the exact same structure as the valid form.\n\n6) Therefore, the given argument is an instance of a valid argument form.\n\nAnswer: yes"
