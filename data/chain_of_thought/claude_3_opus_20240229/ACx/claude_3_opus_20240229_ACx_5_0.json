It only tells us what happens if the zinger was fraggled. \n\n5) Just because the zinger was smoogled doesn't necessarily mean it was fraggled. There could be other reasons why the zinger was smoogled besides being fraggled.\n\n6) The conditional statement would allow us to infer the zinger was smoogled if we knew it was fraggled. But here we are trying to go in the opposite direction - to infer the zinger was fraggled from knowing it was smoogled. The conditional statement doesn't support that inference.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no"
