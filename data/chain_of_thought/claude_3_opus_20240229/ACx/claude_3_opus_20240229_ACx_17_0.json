In other words, if skizzling happens, movating is guaranteed to happen.\n\n5) However, the statement does not say anything about skizzling being necessary for movating. It's possible that the flob could movate without being skizzled.\n\n6) The fact that the flob did movate (from statement 2) does not allow us to conclude that it must have been skizzled, because there could be other reasons for the flob to movate.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the flob was definitely skizzled just from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
