There could be other reasons why the clug snugged.\n\n6) The fact that the clug snugged (statement 2) does not necessarily mean that the reason it snugged was because it was fleeked. \n7) The clug could have snugged for some other reason, unknown to us.\n\n8) Therefore, we cannot infer from the given statements that the clug was definitely fleeked. The clug snugging is not sufficient to conclude the clug was fleeked, since the snugging could have happened for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no"
