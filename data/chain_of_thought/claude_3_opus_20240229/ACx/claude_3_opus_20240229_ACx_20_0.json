It states that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the conditional statement does not say anything about what happens if the fleeg surned. It could be that the fleeg surned because it was bluttered, or it could be that the fleeg surned for some other reason entirely.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that \"The fleeg surned\", but it doesn't tell us why. \n\n5) So, while it's possible that the fleeg surned because it was bluttered, we can't be certain of this. The fleeg might have surned for some other reason that we don't know about.\n\n6) Therefore, we do not have enough information to infer that \"The fleeg was bluttered\". The given statements do not necessarily imply this.\n\nAnswer: no"
