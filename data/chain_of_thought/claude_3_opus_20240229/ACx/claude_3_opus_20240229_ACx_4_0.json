It states that if the condition \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, then the consequence \"the fribble crinked\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the conditional statement does not say anything about the reverse case. It does not state that \"if the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\". \n\n4) The second statement tells us that \"the fribble crinked\" is indeed true.\n\n5) But just because the consequence (\"the fribble crinked\") is true, we cannot infer that the condition (\"the fribble was snurgled\") must also be true. \n\n6) The fribble could have crinked for some other reason, not necessarily because it was snurgled.\n\n7) Therefore, we do not have enough information to infer that \"the fribble was snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: no"
