Modus ponens states that given a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and the assertion of the antecedent (p), we can infer the consequent (q).\n\n5) However, in this case, we have the conditional statement (vroombed \u2192 spened) and the assertion of the consequent (spened), not the antecedent. \n\n6) Asserting the consequent does not allow us to infer the antecedent. This would be the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
