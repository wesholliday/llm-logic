It states that if the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" is true, then the consequence \"it was garpled\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the conditional statement does not say anything about the reverse. In other words, it does not state that if the wug was garpled, then it must have been sproinged.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that \"the wug was garpled\". \n\n5) But just because the wug was garpled, we cannot conclude that it was sproinged. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled, not just being sproinged.\n\n6) The given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the wug was definitely sproinged.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"the wug was sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: no"
