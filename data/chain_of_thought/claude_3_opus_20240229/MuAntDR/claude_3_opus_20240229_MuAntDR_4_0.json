            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting took place at 2 PM, or it was cancelled. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that only one of these two possibilities is true, but we don't know which one.\n\nIf we infer that \"The meeting must have been cancelled,\" we are assuming that the second possibility (the meeting being cancelled) is definitely true. However, based on the original statement, we cannot be certain that the meeting was cancelled, as there is an equal possibility that it took place at 2 PM.\n\nTo infer that the meeting must have been cancelled, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the meeting taking place at 2 PM. Without such information, we cannot make this inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
