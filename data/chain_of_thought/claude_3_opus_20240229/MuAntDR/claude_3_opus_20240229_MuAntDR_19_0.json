            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application must have been completed online or in person\" presents two possible ways in which the application could have been completed: either online or in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are the only two options available.\n\nHowever, the statement does not specify that the application must have been completed in person. It merely states that completing the application in person is one of the two possible ways.\n\nTo infer that \"The application must have been completed in person,\" we would need additional information or context that eliminates the possibility of the application being completed online. Without such information, we cannot make that inference based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
