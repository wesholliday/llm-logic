            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possible scenarios:\n1. The document was signed.\n2. The document was notarized.\n\nThe use of the word \"or\" indicates that either one of these scenarios is sufficient to satisfy the requirement. In other words, the document could have been signed, or it could have been notarized, or it could have been both signed and notarized.\n\nHowever, the statement does not imply that the document must have been notarized. It only states that notarization is one of the acceptable options, but it is not the only option. The document being signed is also a valid possibility.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that \"The document must have been notarized\" because it is not a necessary condition. The document could have been signed instead of being notarized, and it would still satisfy the requirement.\n\nAnswer: no"
