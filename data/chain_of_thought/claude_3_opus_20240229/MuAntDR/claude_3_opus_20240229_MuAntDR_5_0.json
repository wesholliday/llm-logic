            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" presents two possible days when the package could have been delivered: yesterday or the day before yesterday. The word \"or\" indicates that only one of these two options is true, but we don't know which one specifically.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, \"The package must have been delivered the day before,\" narrows down the delivery date to only one option: the day before yesterday. However, based on the original statement, we cannot be certain that this is the case. The package could have been delivered yesterday instead.\n\nSince the original statement allows for two possible delivery dates and the inferred statement chooses only one of those dates, we cannot logically conclude that the inferred statement must be true. The inferred statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true based on the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
