            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" presents two possibilities for the type of event: it was either formal or semi-formal. This is an inclusive \"or\" statement, meaning that either one or both of the options could be true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The event must have been semi-formal\" narrows down the possibilities to only one option: the event being semi-formal. This excludes the possibility of the event being formal.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the event to be either formal or semi-formal, we cannot logically infer that it must have been semi-formal. The event could have been formal, which would still satisfy the conditions of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
