This means there is a possibility that the meeting will be cancelled. \n\n2) However, if there is a possibility that the meeting will be cancelled, that also implies that there is a possibility that the meeting will not be cancelled, i.e., it will be scheduled as planned.\n\n3) So, from the original statement, we can infer two possibilities: either the meeting will be cancelled, or it will be scheduled.\n\n4) The second statement, \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\", is saying exactly this: there are two possibilities, either the meeting will be scheduled or it will be cancelled.\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement correctly captures the implications of the first statement. We can indeed infer \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" from \"The meeting might be cancelled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
