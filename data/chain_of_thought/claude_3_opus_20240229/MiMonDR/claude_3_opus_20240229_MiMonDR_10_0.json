If we don't know for certain that the computer is broken, then it could still potentially be working.\n\n3) The statement 'The computer might be working or broken' captures both possibilities - it allows for the computer to be either working or broken. \n\n4) Since the original statement only mentions the possibility of the computer being broken, but does not rule out the possibility of it working, the second statement is a logical inference. It broadens the possibilities to include both states of the computer.\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement 'The computer might be broken', we can indeed infer that 'The computer might be working or broken'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
