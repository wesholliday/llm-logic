These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: it states that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the milk.\n\n5) The only remaining possibility, then, is that the milk is on the counter.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the truth of the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
