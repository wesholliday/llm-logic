In other words, the missing sock must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket (or possibly both).\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed. This eliminates one of the two possibilities from the first statement.\n\n4) Since we know the sock must be in one of the two places (from the first statement), and we've eliminated the possibility of it being under the bed (from the second statement), the only remaining possibility is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
