These are the only two options given.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n4) If the pen is not on the desk, and the only other possibility given is that it's in the bag, then we can conclude that the pen must be in the bag.\n\n5) This is a valid inference using the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism: if we have a statement of the form \"A or B\", and we also have \"not A\", then we can conclude \"B\".\n\nTherefore, yes, from these two statements we can validly infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
