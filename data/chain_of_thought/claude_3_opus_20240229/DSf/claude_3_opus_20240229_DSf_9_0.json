These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of those possibilities. It states that the missing piece is not on the floor.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the missing piece. \n\n5) With one option eliminated, and given that the initial statement presented these as the only two possibilities, we are left to conclude that the other possibility must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the truth of both given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
