These are presented as the only two possibilities, and they are mutually exclusive (it can't be both).\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the book is not on the table.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the book. The only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n5) Therefore, if the initial statements are true, we can indeed infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
