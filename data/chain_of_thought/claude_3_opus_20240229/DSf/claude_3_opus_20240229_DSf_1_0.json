In other words, Fido must be either in the garden or inside (or possibly both, but we don't know that from this statement alone).\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of these possibilities, namely \"Fido is in the garden\", is false.\n\n4) If we have a disjunction where one of the possibilities is false, then for the disjunction to be true (which it must be, given the first statement), the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"Fido is in the garden\" is false, \"Fido is inside\" must be true for the first statement to hold.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer \"Fido is inside\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
