These are the only two possibilities given.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the keys are not in the cabinet.\n\n4) If the keys are not in the cabinet, and the only other possibility presented is that they are in the drawer, then we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\n5) This is a valid inference based on the information given. If we assume the initial statements are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: yes"
