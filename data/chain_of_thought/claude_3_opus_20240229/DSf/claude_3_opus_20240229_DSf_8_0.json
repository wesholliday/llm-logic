These are presented as the only two possibilities.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: it states that the remote is not under the couch.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then only one possibility remains from the first statement: the remote must be on the coffee table.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
