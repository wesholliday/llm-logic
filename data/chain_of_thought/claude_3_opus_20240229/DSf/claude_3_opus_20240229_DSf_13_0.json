            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box\"\n   - \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\"\n\n2) The first statement is a disjunction, which means at least one of the two parts must be true. In other words, the toy must be either on the shelf or in the box (or possibly both, but we'll come back to that).\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the first part of the disjunction (\"the toy is sitting on the shelf\") is false.\n\n4) If the first part of a disjunction is false, then for the whole disjunction to be true (which it must be, given the first statement), the second part must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the toy isn't on the shelf, it must be in the box for the first statement to be true.\n\n6) The only way the first statement could be true while the second part (\"it is in the toy box\") is false, is if the toy was both on the shelf and in the box at the same time. But this is not possible based on our common understanding of how toys and containers work.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
