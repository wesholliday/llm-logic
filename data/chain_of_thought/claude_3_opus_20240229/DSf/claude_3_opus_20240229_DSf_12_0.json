It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the jacket is in the closet, or it's on the chair.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the jacket is not in the closet.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\n5) The only remaining possibility is the other option presented in the first statement: that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the truth of both given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
