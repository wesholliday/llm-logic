These are the only two options given.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\n5) Therefore, if the sunglasses are not on her head, and the only other option is that they are in her bag, we can infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n6) This is a valid inference based on the given statements and the process of elimination.\n\nAnswer: yes"
