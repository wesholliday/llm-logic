It says that one of two things must be true: either the notebook is on the nightstand, or it's in the drawer.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of the possibilities in the first statement. It says the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n4) If we know that the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer (from statement 1), and we also know it's not on the nightstand (from statement 2), then there's only one possibility left: it must be in the drawer.\n\n5) This is a valid inference. If we assume the two given statements are true, then we can logically conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
