It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the scarf is on the coat rack, or it's in the backpack.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n4) If the scarf must be either on the coat rack or in the backpack (first statement), and it's not on the coat rack (second statement), then there's only one possibility left: it must be in the backpack.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
