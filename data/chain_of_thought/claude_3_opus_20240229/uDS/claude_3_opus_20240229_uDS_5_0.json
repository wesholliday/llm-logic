The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n\n2. The first statement (a) presents two possible locations for the cookies: the jar or the pantry. It also implies that the cookies can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n3. The second statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. It tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\n4. Since we know that the cookies must be in either the jar or the pantry (from statement a), and we also know that they are not in the pantry (from statement b), we can logically conclude that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\n5. This is because the jar is the only remaining location for the cookies, given the information we have.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
