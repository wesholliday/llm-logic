The newspaper isn't on the porch.\n\n2. The first statement presents two possible locations for the newspaper: the driveway or the porch. It also implies that these are the only two possible locations.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of the two possible locations mentioned in the first statement. It tells us that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n4. Since we know that the newspaper must be in one of the two locations (driveway or porch), and we have eliminated the porch as a possibility, the only remaining option is the driveway.\n\n5. Therefore, we can logically infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
