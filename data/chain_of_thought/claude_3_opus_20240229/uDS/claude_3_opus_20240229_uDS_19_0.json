The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\n2. The first statement presents two possible locations for the watch: charging on the dresser or on his wrist. These are the only two options given.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n4. Since we know that the watch must be in one of the two locations mentioned in the first statement, and we have eliminated one of those locations in the second statement, we can conclude that the watch must be in the other location.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
