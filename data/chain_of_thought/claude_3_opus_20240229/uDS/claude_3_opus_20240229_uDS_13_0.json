The toy isn't on the shelf.\n\n2. From the first piece of information, we know that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the toy box or the shelf.\n\n3. The second piece of information eliminates one of these possibilities: the toy isn't on the shelf.\n\n4. Since there were only two possible locations for the toy, and one of them has been eliminated, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
