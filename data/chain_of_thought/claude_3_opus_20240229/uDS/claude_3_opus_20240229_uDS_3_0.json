The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents an either/or situation, meaning that only one of the two possibilities can be true. The keys can either be in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, but not both.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities presented in statement (a). We now know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\n4. Since we have eliminated one of the two possibilities, and we know that one of them must be true, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
