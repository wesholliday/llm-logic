These are presented as the only two possibilities.\n\n3) The second statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the only two possible locations for the missing sock.\n\n5) With only one possibility remaining from the original two, we can indeed infer that the missing sock must be in the other location, which is the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, if we take both given statements to be true, we can logically conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
