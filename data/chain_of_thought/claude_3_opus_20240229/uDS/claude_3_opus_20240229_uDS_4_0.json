The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possibilities: the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. It can't be doing both at the same time.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities presented in statement (a). We now know that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\n4. Since we started with two possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, the only remaining possibility must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, if the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
