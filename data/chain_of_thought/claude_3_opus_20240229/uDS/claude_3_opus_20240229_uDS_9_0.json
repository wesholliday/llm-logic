The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it's either in the box or blending in on the floor. These are the only two options given.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of those possibilities. It states that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\n4. Since we started with only two possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, we are left with only one remaining possibility: the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
