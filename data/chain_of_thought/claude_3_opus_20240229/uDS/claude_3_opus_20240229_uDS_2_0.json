            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a. Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n   b. The book isn't resting on the table.\n\n2. The first statement presents two possible locations for the book: on the shelf or resting on the table. It also implies that the book can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement. It tells us that the book is not resting on the table.\n\n4. Since we know that the book must be either on the shelf or resting on the table (from statement 1), and we also know that it is not resting on the table (from statement 2), we can logically conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\n5. This is because the shelf is the only remaining location for the book, given the information provided in the two statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can infer that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
