It can't be both, and it must be one of these two places.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. We know the pen isn't on the desk.\n\n4) Since we started with only two possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, the only remaining possibility must be true.\n\n5) The only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the pen is in the bag. If it must be either in the bag or on the desk, and it's not on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
