The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possible locations for the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head. It also implies that these are the only two possible locations.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the two possible locations mentioned in statement (a). It tells us that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\n4. Since we know that the sunglasses must be in one of the two locations (from statement (a)), and we have eliminated one of those locations (from statement (b)), we can conclude that the sunglasses must be in the other location.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
