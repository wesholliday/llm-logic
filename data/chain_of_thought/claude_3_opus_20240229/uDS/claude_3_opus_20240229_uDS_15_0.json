The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possible locations for the shoes: in the closet or lined up by the door. It also implies that the shoes can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities presented in statement (a). It tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n4. Since we know that the shoes must be in one of the two locations (from statement (a)), and we have eliminated one of those locations (from statement (b)), we can conclude that the shoes must be in the remaining location.\n\n5. The remaining location is in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
