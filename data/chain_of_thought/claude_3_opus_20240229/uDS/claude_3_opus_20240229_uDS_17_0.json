The scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know there are only two possible locations for the scarf: the backpack or the coat rack.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities by telling us that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n4. Since there were only two possible locations for the scarf, and one of them has been ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the process of elimination, we can logically infer that the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
