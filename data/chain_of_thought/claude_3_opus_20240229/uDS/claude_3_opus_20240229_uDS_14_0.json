The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\n\n2. The first statement presents two possible locations for the milk: on the counter or in the fridge. It also implies that the milk can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement. It tells us that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\n4. Since we know that the milk can only be either on the counter or in the fridge (from statement 1), and we also know that it is not in the fridge (from statement 2), we can logically conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
