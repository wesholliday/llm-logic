Statement (a) presents two possibilities: Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden. These are the only two options given.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of those possibilities. We now know that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n4. Since we started with only two possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, we are left with only one possibility: Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
