The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\n2. The first statement presents two possible locations for the umbrella: in the car or in the closet. It also implies that the umbrella can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement. It tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4. Since we know that the umbrella must be in one of the two locations (car or closet), and we have eliminated the closet as a possibility, the only remaining option is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the process of elimination, we can logically infer that the umbrella is indeed in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
