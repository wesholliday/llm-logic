We are given two statements:\n   a. \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   b. \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possibilities: the phone is either in the living room or ringing in the kitchen. It can't be both, and it must be one of these two options.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities presented in statement (a). We now know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\n4. Since we started with only two possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, we are left with only one option: the phone must be in the living room.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
