The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possible locations for the remote control: on the coffee table or under the couch. It also implies that these are the only two possible locations.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in statement (a). It tells us that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\n4. Since we know that the remote control must be in one of the two locations mentioned in statement (a), and statement (b) has eliminated the possibility of it being under the couch, we can conclude that the remote control must be in the other location mentioned: on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
