The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possibilities for the jacket's location: it is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. These are the only two options given.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in statement (a). It tells us that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n4. Since we started with only two possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, we are left with only one possibility: the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
