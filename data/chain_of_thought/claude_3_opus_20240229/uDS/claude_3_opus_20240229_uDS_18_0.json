The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possible locations for the notebook: the drawer or the nightstand. It also implies that the notebook can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n3. Statement (b) eliminates one of the possibilities presented in statement (a). It tells us that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n4. Since we know the notebook must be in one of the two locations (drawer or nightstand), and we have eliminated the possibility of it being on the nightstand, there is only one remaining possibility: the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\n5. Therefore, we can logically infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
