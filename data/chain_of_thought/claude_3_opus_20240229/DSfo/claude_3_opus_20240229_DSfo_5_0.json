It says that one of two things must be true: either the cookies are in the pantry, or they are in the jar.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry. \n\n4) If the cookies are not in the pantry, then the first part of the disjunction in the second statement (\"the cookies are hidden in the pantry\") must be false.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"the cookies are hidden in the pantry\" is false, then \"they are in the jar\" must be true.\n\n7) So, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
