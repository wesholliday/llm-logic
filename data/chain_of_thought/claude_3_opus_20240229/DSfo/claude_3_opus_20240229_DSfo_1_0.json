In this case, the two possibilities are:\n   - \"Fido is in the garden\"\n   - \"Fido is inside\"\n\n3) The first statement, \"Fido is not in the garden\", directly contradicts one of these possibilities. It tells us that \"Fido is in the garden\" is false.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one of the possibilities is false, the other must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since we know \"Fido is in the garden\" is false, and the disjunction is presumed to be true, we can infer that the other possibility, \"Fido is inside\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
