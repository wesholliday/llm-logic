It states that only one of two possibilities can be true: either the book is on the table, or it is on the shelf.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the book is not on the table.\n\n4) If the book must be either on the table or on the shelf, and we know it's not on the table, then the only remaining possibility is that it is on the shelf.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
