In other words, the shoes must be either by the door or in the closet (or possibly both).\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the shoes are not by the door. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the second statement.\n\n4) Since we know the shoes are not by the door, and we know they must be either by the door or in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that they are in the closet.\n\n5) Therefore, we can indeed infer from these two statements that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
