It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the umbrella is in the closet, or it is in the car.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities (the umbrella being in the closet) is not true.\n\n4) If one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other possibility must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the umbrella is not in the closet, and we know that it must be either in the closet or in the car, then we can infer that it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
