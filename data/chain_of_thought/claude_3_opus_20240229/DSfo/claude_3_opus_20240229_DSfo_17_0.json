It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the scarf is on the coat rack, or it's in the backpack.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack. This eliminates one of the two possibilities from the second statement.\n\n4) If the scarf is not on the coat rack, and it must be either on the coat rack or in the backpack, then the only remaining possibility is that it's in the backpack.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
