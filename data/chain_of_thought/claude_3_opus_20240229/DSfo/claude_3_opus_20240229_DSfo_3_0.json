There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the keys are not in the cabinet, and the second statement says they must be either in the cabinet or in the drawer, we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\n5) This is because if they are not in the cabinet (which we know they are not), the only other possibility according to the second statement is that they are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer from these two statements that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
