There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the newspaper is not on the porch, and the second statement says it must be either on the porch or in the driveway, we can conclude that it must be in the driveway.\n\n5) If it's not on the porch (which we know it's not), and it's either on the porch or in the driveway (which are the only two possibilities given), then it must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer from these two statements that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
