There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the notebook is not on the nightstand, and the second statement says it must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer, we can conclude that it must be in the drawer.\n\n5) If it's not on the nightstand (which we know it's not), and it's either on the nightstand or in the drawer, then it has to be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
