These are the only two possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, then out of the two possibilities given in the second statement, only one remains: the pen must be in the bag.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
