It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the sunglasses are on her head, or they are in her bag.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\n4) If one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other possibility must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the sunglasses are not on her head, and the disjunction is true, then the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n6) The disjunction is assumed to be true (it's given to us as a fact), so we can indeed infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
