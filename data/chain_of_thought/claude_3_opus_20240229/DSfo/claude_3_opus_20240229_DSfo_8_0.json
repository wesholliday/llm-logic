There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the remote is not under the couch, and the second statement says it must be either under the couch or on the coffee table, we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\n5) This is because if it's not under the couch (which we know it's not), then the only other option according to the second statement is that it's on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
