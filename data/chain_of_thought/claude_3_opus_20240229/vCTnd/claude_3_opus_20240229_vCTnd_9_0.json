The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\".\n\n3) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n4) In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. \n\n5) Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n6) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n7) Since the conclusion follows logically from the premise, this form of argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
