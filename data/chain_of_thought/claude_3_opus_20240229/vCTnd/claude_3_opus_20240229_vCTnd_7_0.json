The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". \n\n3) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4) In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. \n\n5) Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n6) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. \n\n7) So this form of argument, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
