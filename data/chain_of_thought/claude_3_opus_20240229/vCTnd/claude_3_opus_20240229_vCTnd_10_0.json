It's a form of contraposition.\n\n3) Contraposition says that a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) In this case, the premise \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" has the form \"If P then not Q\". \n\n5) The conclusion \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" is the contrapositive of the premise. It has the form \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
