The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\".  \n\n3) The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. That means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4) In this case, the conclusion \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" is the contrapositive of the premise \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\".\n\n5) Since the conclusion is the logically equivalent contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
