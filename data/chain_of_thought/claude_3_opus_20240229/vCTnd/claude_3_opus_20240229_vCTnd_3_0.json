The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\".  \n\n3) The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. That means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4) In this case, the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" is the contrapositive of the premise \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\". \n\n5) Since the conclusion is the logically equivalent contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
