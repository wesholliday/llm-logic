The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\".\n\n3) For the argument to be valid, the conclusion must be the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n4) The premise is: \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\"\n   Let P = \"the job was completed\", Q = \"the job was completed well\"\n   So the premise is: \"If P, then not Q\"\n\n5) The contrapositive of this would be: \"If Q, then not P\"\n   In other words: \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\"\n\n6) This is exactly the conclusion of the argument.\n\n7) Therefore, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, so the argument form is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
