The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3) The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. That is, if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n4) In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. \n\n5) Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n6) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n7) So, since the conclusion must be true if the premise is true, this form of argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
