The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". \n\n3) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also guaranteed to be true.\n\n4) So if the premise \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, the argument form which derives the contrapositive as the conclusion from the original statement as a premise is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
