Contraposition says that a statement of the form \"If P then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q then not P\".\n\n3) In this case, the premise \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" has the form \"If P then not Q\". \n\n4) The conclusion \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" has the form \"If Q then not P\".\n\n5) This is exactly the contrapositive form of the premise. \n\n6) Since a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the argument form here is valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
