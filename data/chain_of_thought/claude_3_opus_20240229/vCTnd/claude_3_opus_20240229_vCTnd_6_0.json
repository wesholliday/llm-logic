The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". \n\n3) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4) So if the premise \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, the argument form that derives the contrapositive (the conclusion) from the original statement (the premise) is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
