            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form: \n   Premise: If P, then not Q\n   Conclusion: If Q, then not P\n\n2) This is actually the contrapositive form. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". \n\n3) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also guaranteed to be true.\n\n4) So if the premise \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" must also be true.\n\n5) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Here, if we assume the premise is true, then the conclusion is guaranteed to be true based on the logic of contrapositives.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
