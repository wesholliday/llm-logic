We can represent this as:\n   ~(Wolf in den)\n\n3) Now, we have a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent. This is the setup for a logical rule called Modus Tollens. \n\n4) Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q), and we also know that the consequent is false (~Q), then we can infer that the antecedent must also be false (~P).\n\n5) Applying Modus Tollens to our statements:\n   Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den\n   ~(Wolf in den)\n   Therefore, ~(Bear in cave)\n\n6) So, yes, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
