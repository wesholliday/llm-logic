We can write this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that Q is false: the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens which states that if we have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, and we also know that Q is false, then we can infer that P must also be false.\n\n5) Applying Modus Tollens to our statements:\n   - We have: If the griffin was in the forest (P), then the unicorn was in the forest (Q). (P \u2192 Q)\n   - We also know: The unicorn was not in the forest. (Not Q)\n   - Therefore, we can infer: The griffin was not in the forest. (Not P)\n\nSo, using the rules of logic, specifically Modus Tollens, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
