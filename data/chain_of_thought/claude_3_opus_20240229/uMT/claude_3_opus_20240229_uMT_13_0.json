In logical terms, this is saying:\n   \n   Car is red \u2192 Truck is blue\n\n2) The second statement tells us that the truck is not blue. In logical terms:\n   \n   Truck is not blue\n\n3) Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it says:\n   \n   Truck is not blue \u2192 Car is not red\n\n4) We know from step 2 that \"Truck is not blue\" is true. Therefore, from the contrapositive in step 3, we can infer that \"Car is not red\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
