            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   - The mummy was not awake.\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional: If P (vampire awake), then Q (mummy awake). In logic, this is written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that Q is false: the mummy was not awake. In logic, this is written as \u00acQ.\n\n4) We are asked if we can infer that the vampire was not awake, i.e., if \u00acP is true.\n\n5) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Tollens. It states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we also know that the consequent (Q) is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n6) In this case, we have:\n   - P \u2192 Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n   - \u00acQ (The mummy was not awake)\n\n7) By Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n   - \u00acP (The vampire was not awake)\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
