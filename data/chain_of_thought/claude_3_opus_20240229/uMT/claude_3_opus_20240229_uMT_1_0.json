In other words, if Mary was there, then Sue must have been there too.\n\n2) The second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This is a fact.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the two possible scenarios:\n\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then according to the first statement, Sue must have been at the wedding too. But this contradicts the second statement which says Sue was not at the wedding. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n   b) If Mary was not at the wedding, then there is no contradiction. The first statement doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary was not at the wedding. And this scenario is consistent with the fact that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n4) Since scenario a) leads to a contradiction and scenario b) does not, we can infer that scenario b) must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
