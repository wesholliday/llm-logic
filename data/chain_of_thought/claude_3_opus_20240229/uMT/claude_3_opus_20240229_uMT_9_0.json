            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This is the negation of the second part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. In logic, there's a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the second part (the consequent) is false, then the first part (the antecedent) must also be false.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - The conditional statement is true: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - The second part is false: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   - Therefore, the first part must also be false: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\n5. So, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
