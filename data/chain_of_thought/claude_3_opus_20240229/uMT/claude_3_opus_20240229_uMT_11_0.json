In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   Chocolate cake \u2192 Blueberry muffins\n\n2. The second statement says that the muffins were not blueberry. In other words, the consequent of the conditional in step 1 is false.\n\n3. In a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the antecedent. The antecedent could be either true or false.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer whether the cake was chocolate or not. The cake could have been chocolate or not chocolate - we don't have enough information to decide.\n\nAnswer: no"
