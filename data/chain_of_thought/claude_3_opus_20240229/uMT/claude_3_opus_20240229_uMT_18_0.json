            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   - The truck was not metal.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"the truck was not metal\". This contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n\n4. In logic, when the consequence of a conditional statement is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the condition. In other words, if \"the truck was metal\" is false, we cannot infer whether \"the doll was plastic\" is true or false.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say whether the doll was plastic or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
