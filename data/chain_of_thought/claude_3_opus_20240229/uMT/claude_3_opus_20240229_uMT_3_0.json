In other words, James only writes mystery novels.\n\n2) The second statement tells us that the book in question is not a mystery novel.\n\n3) Now, if James had written this book, it would have to be a mystery novel (according to the first statement). \n\n4) But we know that this book is not a mystery novel (according to the second statement).\n\n5) Therefore, it cannot be the case that James wrote this book. If he had, it would be a mystery novel, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that James did not write this book.\n\nAnswer: yes"
