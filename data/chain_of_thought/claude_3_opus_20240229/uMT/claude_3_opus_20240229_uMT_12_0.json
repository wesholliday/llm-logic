The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it reverses and negates both parts of the conditional. It would be:\n   Lucy did not go to zoo \u2192 Joe did not go to park\n\n4) We know from the second statement that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is true. \n\n5) Therefore, from the contrapositive (step 3), we can infer that \"Joe did not go to park\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
