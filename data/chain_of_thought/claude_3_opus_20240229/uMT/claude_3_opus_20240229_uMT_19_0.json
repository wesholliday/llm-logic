            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is the negation of the second part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. In logic, there's a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the second part (the consequent) is false, then the first part (the antecedent) must also be false.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our problem:\n   - The conditional statement is true: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - The second part is false: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   - Therefore, the first part must also be false: \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n5. So, yes, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
