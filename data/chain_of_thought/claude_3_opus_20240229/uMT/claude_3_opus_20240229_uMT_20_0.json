            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step using deductive logic:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" \n   This means that if we know the apple was red, we can infer the banana was yellow. \n   However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the apple was not red.\n\n2. The second statement tells us \"the banana was not yellow.\" \n\n3. We are asked if we can infer that \"the apple was not red.\"\n\n4. From the first statement alone, we can't make this inference. If the apple was not red, the first statement doesn't tell us anything about the color of the banana.\n\n5. However, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement: \n   \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n   This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6. Now, using the contrapositive and the second statement together:\n   - We know the banana was not yellow (from the second statement)\n   - The contrapositive tells us that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n   - Therefore, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
