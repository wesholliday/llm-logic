            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. We can represent this as:\n   Dog inside \u2192 Cat outside\n\n2. The second statement tells us that the cat was not outside. We can represent this as:\n   \u00ac(Cat outside)\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it states:\n   If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n   \u00ac(Cat outside) \u2192 \u00ac(Dog inside)\n\n4. From step 2, we know that \u00ac(Cat outside) is true.\n\n5. Using modus ponens (if P \u2192 Q is true, and P is true, then Q must be true), we can conclude from steps 3 and 4 that:\n   \u00ac(Dog inside) is true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
