            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement gives a conditional: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. We can represent this as:\n   Shirt is cotton \u2192 Pants are denim\n\n2. The second statement says that the pants were not denim. In other words:\n   Pants are not denim\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it reverses and negates both parts of the conditional:\n   Pants are not denim \u2192 Shirt is not cotton\n\n4. We know from the second statement that \"Pants are not denim\" is true. And from the contrapositive in step 3, we know that if \"Pants are not denim\" is true, then \"Shirt is not cotton\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
