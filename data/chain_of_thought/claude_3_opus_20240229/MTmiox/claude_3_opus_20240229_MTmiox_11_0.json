This means there's a possibility the flug was not zimmed. \n\n2) We are also told \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\". This is a conditional statement. It means that blumming the flug is a sufficient condition for the flug to have been zimmed. In other words, if the flug was blummed, then we can conclude with certainty that it was zimmed.\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed\". \n\n4) From (1), we know the flug might not have been zimmed. If the flug was not zimmed, then according to the contrapositive of statement (2), the flug could not have been blummed.\n\n5) Therefore, since there's a possibility that the flug was not zimmed, there's also a possibility that the flug was not blummed.\n\n6) However, the given statements do not allow us to conclude with certainty that the flug was not blummed. We can only say that it might not have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: no"
