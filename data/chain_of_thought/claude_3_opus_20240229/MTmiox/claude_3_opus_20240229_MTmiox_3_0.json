            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat might not have quanked\"\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n\n2) The first statement tells us that it's possible the splat did not quank. In other words, we can't be certain that the splat quanked.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it says that if the splat was morphed, then it necessarily quanked. We can rephrase this as \"Morphing is sufficient for quanking\" or \"Quanking is necessary for morphing\".\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that the splat was not morphed. \n\n5) From the first statement, we know quanking is uncertain. From the second statement, we know that if morphing happened, then quanking must have happened.\n\n6) So if quanking is uncertain, then morphing must also be uncertain (because if morphing definitely happened, then quanking would definitely have happened too, contradicting statement 1).\n\n7) Therefore, we can indeed infer that the splat was not definitely morphed. If it was definitely morphed, it would definitely have quanked, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
