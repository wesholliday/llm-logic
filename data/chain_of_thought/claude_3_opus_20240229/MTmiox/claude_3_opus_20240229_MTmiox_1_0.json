In other words, we can't be certain that the flugel was zargled.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it necessarily follows that the flugel was zargled.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\".\n\n5) Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that the flugel was blimmed. If this were the case, then according to the second statement, the flugel must have been zargled.\n\n6) However, this would contradict the first statement, which tells us that the flugel might not have been zargled.\n\n7) Therefore, our supposition that the flugel was blimmed leads to a contradiction. The only way to avoid this contradiction is if the flugel was not blimmed.\n\n8) Thus, we can indeed infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
