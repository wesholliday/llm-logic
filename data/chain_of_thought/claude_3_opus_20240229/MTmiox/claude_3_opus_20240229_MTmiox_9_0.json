This means there's a possibility the twonk was not varnished. \n\n2. We are also told \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished\". This is a conditional statement. It means that being plinked is a sufficient condition for the twonk to have been varnished. In other words, if we know the twonk was plinked, then we can infer for certain that it was varnished.\n\n3. Now, we want to know if we can infer that the twonk was not plinked. Let's consider the two possibilities:\n\n   a) If the twonk was plinked, then according to statement 2, it must have been varnished. But this contradicts the possibility in statement 1 that it might not have been varnished. \n\n   b) If the twonk was not plinked, then statement 2 doesn't tell us anything about whether it was varnished or not. This is consistent with statement 1.\n\n4. Therefore, the only possibility that is consistent with both statements is that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
