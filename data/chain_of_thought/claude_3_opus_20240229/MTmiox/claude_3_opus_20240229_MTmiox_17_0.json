            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The flob might not have movated\"\n   - \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\"\n\n2) The first statement tells us it's possible the flob did not movate. In other words, it's not certain that the flob movated.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it says that if the flob was skizzled, then it necessarily movated. \n\n4) We want to know if we can infer from these two statements that \"The flob was not skizzled\".\n\n5) Well, the second statement tells us that if the flob was skizzled, it must have movated. But the first statement says the flob might not have movated.\n\n6) So if the flob was skizzled, that would contradict the first statement, because then the flob would have had to movate.\n\n7) Therefore, in order for both statements to be true, it must be the case that the flob was not skizzled. That way, the flob could have not movated, without contradicting the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
