            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The fleeg might not have been surned\"\n   - \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\"\n\n2) The first statement suggests that it's possible that the fleeg was not surned. It doesn't say for certain that it wasn't surned, just that it might not have been.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it says that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. In other words, being bluttered is a sufficient condition for being surned.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\n5) If the fleeg was bluttered, then according to the second statement, it must have been surned. But the first statement says the fleeg might not have been surned.\n\n6) So, if the fleeg was bluttered, we would have a contradiction: it would have to be surned (according to statement 2) and yet it might not be surned (according to statement 1).\n\n7) The only way to avoid this contradiction is if the fleeg was not bluttered. That way, statement 2 doesn't apply, and there's no conflict with statement 1.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
