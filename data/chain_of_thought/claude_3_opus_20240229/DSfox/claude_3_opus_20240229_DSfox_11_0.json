We are also told \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\". This is a logical disjunction - it means at least one of those two possibilities must be true. Either the flug is zimmed, or the flug is blummed, or possibly both.\n\n3. From statement 1, we know the flug is not zimmed. Therefore, the first possibility in the disjunction from statement 2 is false.\n\n4. In a disjunction, if one possibility is false, the other possibility must be true in order for the overall disjunction to be true.\n\n5. Therefore, since we know \"the flug is zimmed\" is false, then in order for the disjunction \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\" to be true, it must be the case that \"the flug is blummed\" is true.\n\nSo yes, from those two statements, we can logically infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
