The first statement clearly tells us that the splat is not quanked. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - it says the splat must be either quanked or morphed. It can't be both, and it must be one of the two.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the splat is definitely not quanked, then looking at the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
