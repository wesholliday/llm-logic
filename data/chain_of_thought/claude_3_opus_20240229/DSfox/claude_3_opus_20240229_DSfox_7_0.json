We are given two statements:\n   - \"The whiffle is not tinked\"\n   - \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked\"\n\n2. The first statement clearly tells us that the whiffle is not tinked. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - the whiffle must be either tinked or shanked. These seem to be the only two possibilities.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the whiffle is not tinked, and the second statement says it must be either tinked or shanked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n5. Therefore, by process of elimination using the information from the two given statements, we can logically infer that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
