We are given two statements:\n   - \"The grommet is not plopped\"\n   - \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\"\n\n2. The first statement clearly tells us that the grommet is not plopped. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - the grommet must be either plopped or sploffed. There are no other options given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the grommet is not plopped, then according to the second statement, it must be sploffed.\n\n5. If the grommet is not plopped, and it must be either plopped or sploffed, then logically it has to be sploffed.\n\nTherefore, yes, from the given statements we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
