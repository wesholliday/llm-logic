We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket is not daggled\"\n   - \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\"\n\n2. The first statement clearly tells us that the sprocket is not daggled. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - the sprocket must be either daggled or cranked. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket is definitely not daggled, then looking at the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the sprocket is indeed cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
