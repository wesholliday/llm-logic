The first statement clearly tells us that the flob is not movated. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - the flob must be either movated or skizzled. It can't be both, and it must be one of the two.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flob is not movated, then in the either/or scenario presented in the second statement, it must be the case that the flob is skizzled.\n\n5. If the flob was not skizzled, then according to the second statement it would have to be movated. But we know it's not movated based on the first statement. Therefore, it must be skizzled.\n\nSo, by combining the information from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
