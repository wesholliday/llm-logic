The first statement clearly tells us that the wug is not bimmed. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - it says the wug must be either bimmed or flooped. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the wug is definitely not bimmed, then looking at the either/or scenario in the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the wug must be flooped.\n\n5. Therefore, putting the information from the two statements together, we can logically infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
