We are given two statements:\n   - \"The twonk is not plinked\"\n   - \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished\"\n\n2. The first statement clearly tells us that the twonk is not plinked. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - the twonk must be either plinked or varnished. It can't be both, and it must be one of the two.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the twonk is not plinked, then in the either/or scenario presented in the second statement, we must conclude that the twonk is varnished.\n\n5. If the twonk was not varnished, then according to the second statement it would have to be plinked. But we know it's not plinked based on the first statement. Therefore, it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
