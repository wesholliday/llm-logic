The first statement clearly states that the wug is not garpled. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - it says the wug must be either garpled or sproinged. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the wug is definitely not garpled, then in the either/or situation presented in the second statement, the wug must be sproinged.\n\n5. If the wug was not sproinged, then according to the second statement it would have to be garpled. But we know it is not garpled based on the first statement. Therefore, it must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
