It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the sneg is sproted, or the sneg is crampled.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the sneg is not sproted. This eliminates one of the two possibilities from the second statement.\n\n4) If the sneg is not sproted, and it must be either sproted or crampled, then the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
