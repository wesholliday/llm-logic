The first statement clearly tells us that the clug is not snugged. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or situation - it says the clug must be either snugged or fleeked. It can't be both, and it must be one of those two options.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the clug is definitely not snugged, that eliminates the first option in the either/or statement. \n\n5. That only leaves the second option - the clug must be fleeked. There are no other possibilities given the information we have.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
