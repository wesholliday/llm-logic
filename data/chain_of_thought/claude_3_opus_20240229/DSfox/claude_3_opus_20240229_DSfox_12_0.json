We are also told \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped\". This is an either/or statement - one of the two options must be true. \n\n3. Since we know from step 1 that \"The smip is lupped\" is false, for the either/or statement in step 2 to be true, the other option \"The smip is shripped\" must be the true one.\n\n4. Therefore, we can logically infer that \"The smip is shripped\" based on the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
