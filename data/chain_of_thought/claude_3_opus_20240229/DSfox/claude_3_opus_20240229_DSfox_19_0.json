We are also told \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled\".\n\n3. From the first statement, we know the smonk is not plagged. \n4. The second statement gives us two possibilities - either the smonk is plagged, or it is vreebled.\n5. But we already know from the first statement that the smonk is not plagged. \n6. Therefore, for the second statement to be true, the other possibility must be the case - the smonk must be vreebled.\n\n7. So yes, from these two statements together, we can logically infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
