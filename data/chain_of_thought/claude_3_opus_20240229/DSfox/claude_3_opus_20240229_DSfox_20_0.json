These are the only two options presented.\n\n4) But we know from the first statement that the fleeg is not surned. \n\n5) Therefore, of the two possibilities given in the second statement, the first one (the fleeg is surned) must be false.\n\n6) If the first part of an \"either/or\" statement is false, then logically the second part must be true in order for the overall statement to be true.\n\n7) So if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered, based on the information provided in the two statements.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
