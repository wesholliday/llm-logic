These are the only two options presented.\n\n4) However, we know from the first statement that the flugel is not zargled. \n\n5) Therefore, of the two possibilities given in the second statement, the first one (the flugel is zargled) must be false.\n\n6) If the second statement is true, and we know the first possibility in it is false, then the second possibility (the flugel is blimmed) must be true.\n\n7) So yes, from the two given statements, we can logically conclude that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
