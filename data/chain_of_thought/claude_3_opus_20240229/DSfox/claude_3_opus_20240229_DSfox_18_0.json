The first statement clearly tells us that the shank is not nugged. \n\n3. The second statement presents an either/or scenario - it says the shank must be either nugged or plooked. \n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the shank is definitely not nugged, that eliminates the first possibility in the either/or statement.\n\n5. That only leaves the second possibility from the either/or statement - if the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer from the given statements that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
