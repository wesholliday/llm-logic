These are the only two options presented.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the dreb is not spened, that eliminates the first possibility in the second statement.\n\n5) That leaves us with only one remaining possibility from the second statement - the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer from the given statements that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
