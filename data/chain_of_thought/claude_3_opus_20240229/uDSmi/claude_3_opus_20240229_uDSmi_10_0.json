It must be in one of those two places.\n\n3) Statement (b) suggests that there's a possibility that the sock is not under the bed. However, it doesn't say for certain that the sock is not under the bed.\n\n4) If the sock is not under the bed, then according to statement (a), it must be in the laundry basket.\n\n5) However, the word \"might\" in statement (b) leaves open the possibility that the sock could still be under the bed.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't say for certain that the sock is in the laundry basket. It could be there, but it could also still be under the bed.\n\nAnswer: no"
