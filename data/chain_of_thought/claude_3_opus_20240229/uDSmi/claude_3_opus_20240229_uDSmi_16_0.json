The pen might not be on my desk.\n\n2. The first statement presents two possibilities: the pen is either in the bag or on the desk. There are no other options given.\n\n3. The second statement introduces uncertainty about one of those possibilities. It suggests that the pen being on the desk is not certain.\n\n4. However, the second statement does not definitively rule out the possibility of the pen being on the desk. It only says it \"might not\" be there, which means it could still be there.\n\n5. Since we can't be sure that the pen is not on the desk, we cannot logically infer that it must be in the bag. The pen could be in either location based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
