There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) suggests that there's a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\n4) If the cookies are not in the pantry, and the only other option given is the jar, then we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\n5) However, the word \"might\" in statement (b) introduces some uncertainty. It doesn't definitively state that the cookies are not in the pantry, only that they might not be.\n\n6) If there's a chance that the cookies are in the pantry, then we can't be absolutely certain that they are in the jar.\n\n7) To infer with certainty that the cookies are in the jar, we would need a definitive statement that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no"
