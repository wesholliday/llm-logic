This means that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper: the driveway or the porch.\n\n2) We are also told that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. This means that it's possible that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n3) If the newspaper is not on the porch, and there are only two possible locations (the driveway or the porch), then the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\n4) However, the statement \"the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\" does not definitively state that the newspaper is not on the porch. It only states that it's possible that it's not on the porch.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. It could be in the driveway, but it could also still be on the porch.\n\nAnswer: no"
