This means that these are the only two possible locations for the milk.\n\n2) We are also told that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. This means that it's possible that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\n3) If the milk is not in the fridge, and the only other possible location is the counter, then the milk must be on the counter.\n\n4) Therefore, if the milk might not be in the fridge, we can infer that it might be on the counter.\n\n5) However, the word \"might\" introduces some uncertainty. Just because the milk might not be in the fridge doesn't necessarily mean it definitely is on the counter. There's still a possibility it could be in the fridge.\n\n6) To infer with certainty that the milk is on the counter, we would need a stronger statement, like \"the milk is not in the fridge\".\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can't infer with 100% certainty that the milk is on the counter. We can only say it might be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no"
