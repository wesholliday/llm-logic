This means that these are the only two possible locations for the toy.\n\n2) We are also told that the toy might not be sitting on the shelf. This means that it's possible that the toy is not on the shelf.\n\n3) If the toy is not on the shelf, and the only other possible location is the toy box, then the toy must be in the toy box.\n\n4) However, the statement \"the toy might not be sitting on the shelf\" does not definitively tell us that the toy is not on the shelf. It only tells us that it's possible that the toy is not on the shelf.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy is in the toy box. It could be in the toy box, but it could also still be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no"
