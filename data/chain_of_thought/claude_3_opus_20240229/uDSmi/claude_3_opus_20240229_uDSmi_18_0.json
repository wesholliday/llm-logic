There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) suggests that there's a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n4) If the notebook is not on the nightstand, and according to statement (a) it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand, then the only remaining possibility is that it is in the drawer.\n\n5) Therefore, based on the given statements, if the notebook is not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nHowever, statement (b) only says that the notebook \"might not\" be on the nightstand, which means there's still a possibility that it is on the nightstand. \n\n6) So while we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer if it's not on the nightstand, we can't definitively say it's in the drawer because there's still a possibility it's on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: no"
