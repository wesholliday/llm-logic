The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possibilities: the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet. It's an either/or situation.\n\n3. Statement (b) suggests that there's a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. However, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that they are in the cabinet.\n\n4. If we were to conclude that the keys are definitely in the drawer, we would need a stronger statement that completely eliminates the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet.\n\n5. Since statement (b) only suggests that the keys might not be in the cabinet, we can't infer with certainty that they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no"
