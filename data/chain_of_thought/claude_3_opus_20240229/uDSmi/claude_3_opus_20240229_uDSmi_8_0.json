It must be in one of these two locations.\n\n3) Statement (b) introduces some uncertainty about one of these locations. If the remote control might not be under the couch, then it's possible that it's not under the couch.\n\n4) However, statement (b) doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that the remote is under the couch. It just says it might not be there.\n\n5) So, while it's possible that the remote is on the coffee table (and this possibility might even seem more likely given the uncertainty about it being under the couch), we can't infer this with certainty. The remote could still be under the couch, even if it might not be.\n\n6) To infer with certainty that the remote is on the coffee table, we would need a stronger statement, like \"The remote control is definitely not under the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
