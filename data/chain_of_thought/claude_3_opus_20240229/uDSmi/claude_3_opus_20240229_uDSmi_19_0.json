This means that there are only two possible locations for the watch: on the dresser charging, or on his wrist.\n\n2. We are also told that the watch might not be on his wrist. This means that it's possible that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n3. If the watch is not on his wrist, and there are only two possible locations for the watch (on the dresser charging or on his wrist), then the watch must be on the dresser charging.\n\n4. However, the statement \"the watch might not be on his wrist\" does not definitively tell us that the watch is not on his wrist. It only tells us that it's possible that it's not on his wrist.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser. It could be, but we don't have enough information to say for sure.\n\nAnswer: no"
