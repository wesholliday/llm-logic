The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possible locations for the umbrella: in the car or in the closet. It also implies that these are the only two possible locations.\n\n3. Statement (b) suggests that there is a possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet. However, it doesn't definitively state that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4. If we were to conclude that the umbrella is definitely in the car, we would need to know with certainty that it is not in the closet. Statement (b) doesn't provide that certainty.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the umbrella is in the car. It might be in the car, but there's still a possibility that it could be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: no"
