This means that these are the only two possible locations for the book.\n\n2) We are also told that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that it's possible that the book is not on the table.\n\n3) If the book is not on the table, and the only other possible location is the shelf, then the book must be on the shelf.\n\n4) However, the statement \"the book might not be resting on the table\" does not definitively state that the book is not on the table. It only states that it's possible that the book is not on the table.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf. It could be on the shelf, but it could also still be on the table.\n\nAnswer: no"
