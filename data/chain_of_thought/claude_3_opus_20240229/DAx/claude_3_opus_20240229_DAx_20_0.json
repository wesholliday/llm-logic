It states that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that \"the fleeg was not bluttered\". In other words, the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition (antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any conclusion about the consequence (consequent). The consequence could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether \"the fleeg surned\" or \"the fleeg did not surn\". There is not enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
