It states that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the consequence \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that \"the splat was not morphed\". In other words, the condition in the first statement is not true.\n\n4) Now, when the condition (or antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequence (or consequent). The consequence could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively say whether \"the splat quanked\" or \"the splat did not quank\". There is not enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
