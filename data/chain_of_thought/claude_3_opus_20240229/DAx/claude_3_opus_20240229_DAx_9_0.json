'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' is a conditional statement. It can be represented as:\n   P (plinked) \u2192 V (varnished)\n\n2. 'The twonk was not plinked' negates the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement. It can be represented as:\n   ~P (not plinked)\n\n3. From the given information, we have:\n   P \u2192 V\n   ~P\n\n4. To infer 'The twonk was not varnished' (~V), we would need to have the logical structure:\n   P \u2192 V\n   ~V\n   Therefore, ~P\n\n   This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional statement.\n\n5. However, in this case, we have the negation of the antecedent (~P) instead of the negation of the consequent (~V). The logical structure we have is:\n   P \u2192 V\n   ~P\n   \n   This does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about V (whether the twonk was varnished or not).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not varnished'.\n\nAnswer: no"
