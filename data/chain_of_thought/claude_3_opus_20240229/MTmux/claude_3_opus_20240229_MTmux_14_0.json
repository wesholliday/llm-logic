            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It says that if the clug was fleeked, then it necessarily follows that the clug was snugged.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It says that it's not necessarily the case that the clug was snugged.\n\n4) Now, in logic, there's a rule called modus tollens. It says that if we have a conditional statement, and we negate the consequent, we can infer the negation of the antecedent.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens here:\n   - The conditional is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"\n   - The negation of the consequent is: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\"\n   - Therefore, we can infer the negation of the antecedent: \"The clug was not fleeked\"\n\n6) So, by the rule of modus tollens, yes, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
