            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the consequence \"the splat must have quanked\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the splat must have quanked\" is not true.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional, if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false. This is because a true condition in a conditional always leads to a true consequence.\n\n5) Applying this to our problem: since the consequence \"the splat must have quanked\" is not true (as per the second statement), the condition \"the splat was morphed\" must also not be true.\n\n6) Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
