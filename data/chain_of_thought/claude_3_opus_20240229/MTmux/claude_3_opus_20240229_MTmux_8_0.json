            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It says that if the sprocket was cranked, then it necessarily follows that the sprocket was daggled.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It says that it's not necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled.\n\n4) Now, if the sprocket was indeed cranked, then according to the first statement, it must have been daggled. But the second statement contradicts this - it says the sprocket didn't have to be daggled.\n\n5) The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the antecedent of the first statement (the \"if\" part) is false. That is, the sprocket was not cranked.\n\n6) This is an application of the logical rule of modus tollens: if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
