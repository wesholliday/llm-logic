Let's symbolize this as: \u00acC\n\n3) Now, we want to know if from these two statements, we can infer: \"The fribble was not snurgled\". \n   This would be symbolized as: \u00acS\n\n4) In propositional logic, there is a rule of inference called Modus Tollens. It states that:\n   If we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and we also have the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\n5) In this case, we have:\n   - The conditional statement: S \u2192 C\n   - The negation of the consequent: \u00acC\n   Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer the negation of the antecedent: \u00acS\n\n6) \u00acS is exactly the statement we were trying to infer: \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nTherefore, yes, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
