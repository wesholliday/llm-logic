            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zibble might be frobbed and quorked\" uses the conjunction \"and\". In propositional logic, we can simplify a conjunction by dropping one of the conjuncts. This is because if both A and B are true, then A is true and B is true individually as well.\n\nSo in this case, \"The zibble might be frobbed and quorked\" implies both \"The zibble might be frobbed\" and \"The zibble might be quorked\" separately. We can infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes"
