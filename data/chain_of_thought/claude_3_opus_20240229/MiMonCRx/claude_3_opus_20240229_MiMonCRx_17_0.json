            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The quibble might be frazzled and gronked\" uses the conjunction \"and\" to join the two predicates \"frazzled\" and \"gronked\". In propositional logic, when two propositions P and Q are joined by \"and\", the resulting compound proposition \"P and Q\" is true if and only if both P and Q are true individually.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"The quibble might be frazzled and gronked\" is true, then it must be the case that both \"The quibble might be frazzled\" and \"The quibble might be gronked\" are true separately.\n\nSo, from the truth of \"The quibble might be frazzled and gronked\", we can validly infer the truth of \"The quibble might be gronked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
