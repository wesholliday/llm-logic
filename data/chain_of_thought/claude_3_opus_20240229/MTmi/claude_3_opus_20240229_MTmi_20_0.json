            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\". We can represent this as:\n   Red Apple \u2192 Yellow Banana\n\n2) The second statement says: \"The banana might not have been yellow\". This means there's a possibility that the banana was not yellow. In other words, it's not certain that the banana was yellow. We can represent this as:\n   Possibly (Not Yellow Banana)\n\n3) Now, we're asked if we can infer that \"The apple was not red\". \n\n4) From the first statement alone, we can't say anything definitive about the color of the apple. The statement only tells us about the banana's color under the condition that the apple was red. It doesn't tell us whether the apple was actually red or not.\n\n5) The second statement introduces uncertainty about the banana's color. However, this doesn't directly affect our knowledge about the apple's color.\n\n6) Even if the banana was not yellow, this doesn't necessarily mean that the apple was not red. The first statement only says that a red apple implies a yellow banana. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the banana is not yellow.\n\n7) Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no"
