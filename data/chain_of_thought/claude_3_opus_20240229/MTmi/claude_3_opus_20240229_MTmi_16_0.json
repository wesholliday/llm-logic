            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\n   - \"The pants might not have been denim\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the consequence \"the pants must have been denim\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement suggests that there's a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\n4) Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and is formed by negating both parts of the conditional and swapping them. So the contrapositive would be:\n   - \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\"\n\n5) The second statement aligns with the condition in the contrapositive. If the pants might not have been denim, then according to the contrapositive, the shirt was not cotton.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
