            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". We can represent this as:\n   Lisa bought red => Mark bought blue\n\n2) The second statement says \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\". This means there's a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. In other words, it's not certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it says:\n   Mark did not buy blue => Lisa did not buy red\n\n4) From (2), we know there's a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If this is the case, then from (3), we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n5) However, (2) doesn't say that Mark definitely did not buy the blue shirt, only that he might not have. So while we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can't be certain that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
