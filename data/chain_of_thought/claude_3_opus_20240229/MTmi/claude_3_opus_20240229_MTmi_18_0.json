            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n   - \"The truck might not have been metal\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It says that if the doll was plastic, it necessarily follows that the truck was metal. In other words, a plastic doll implies a metal truck.\n\n3. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the truck being metal. It suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\n4. Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic\".\n\n5. If the doll was indeed plastic, then based on the first statement, the truck must have been metal. However, this conflicts with the second statement which allows for the possibility of the truck not being metal.\n\n6. Therefore, to resolve this conflict and maintain consistency with both statements, we must conclude that the doll could not have been plastic.\n\n7. If the doll was not plastic, then the first statement (being a conditional) doesn't tell us anything about the truck. This allows the second statement to be true without causing a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
