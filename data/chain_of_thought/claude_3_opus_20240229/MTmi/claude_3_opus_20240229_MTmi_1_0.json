            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n   - \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue's presence at the wedding is necessary for Mary's presence. In other words, if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding either.\n\n3) The second statement introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence at the wedding. \"Might not\" suggests that it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n4) Now, if Sue was not at the wedding (which is possible, according to the second statement), then based on the first statement, Mary could not have been at the wedding either.\n\n5) However, the second statement doesn't say for certain that Sue was not at the wedding, only that she might not have been. So we can't say for sure that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n6) In other words, the information given is not sufficient to definitively conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. Sue's uncertain status at the wedding leaves open the possibility that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
