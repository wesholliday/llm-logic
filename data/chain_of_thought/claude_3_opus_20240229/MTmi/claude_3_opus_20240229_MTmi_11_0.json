            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n   - \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the cake was chocolate, then it necessarily follows that the muffins were blueberry. In other words, chocolate cake implies blueberry muffins.\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry. This means that the muffins being blueberry is not certain.\n\n4) Now, if we assume that the cake was indeed chocolate, then according to the first statement, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, this contradicts the second statement, which says that the muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\n5) Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that our assumption in step 4 was wrong. In other words, the cake could not have been chocolate.\n\n6) Thus, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
