            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or flump wibble\" presents two possibilities for what the snorkel might be: either flibbit wibble or flump wibble. The question is asking whether we can infer a restatement of this that makes the two possibilities more explicit by saying \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble\".\n\nLogically, the two statements are equivalent. The original statement already implies that there are two distinct possibilities, and the rephrased version just states this more explicitly by repeating \"might be\" for each possibility. The meaning is the same in both cases.\n\nSince the rephrased version doesn't add, remove, or change the meaning compared to the original statement, we can validly infer it from the original. The inference is logically sound.\n\nAnswer: yes"
