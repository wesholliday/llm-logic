            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zizz might be quank bimboozle or wobble\" presents two possibilities for what the zizz might be: either quank bimboozle or wobble. The rephrased statement \"The zizz might be quank bimboozle or it might be wobble\" conveys the same meaning, just with slightly different wording. It still presents the same two possibilities for what the zizz might be. Since the meaning and logical structure are preserved, we can indeed infer the rephrased statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes"
