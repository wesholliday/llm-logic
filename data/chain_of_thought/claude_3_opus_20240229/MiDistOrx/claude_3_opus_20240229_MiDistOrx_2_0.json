            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle\" presents two possible locations for the wibble: on the zizz, or in the snizzle. These are presented as alternatives joined by the word \"or\".\n\nThe proposed inference \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It explicitly states the two possibilities using the word \"might\" for each one. This is logically equivalent to the original phrasing.\n\nSince both statements express the same idea - that there are two possible locations for the wibble - the proposed inference is valid. The meaning has not been changed, only the wording.\n\nAnswer: yes"
