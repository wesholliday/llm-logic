            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank\" presents two possible locations for the snork: either in the wibble or on the quank. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are the only two possibilities being considered.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It breaks down the two possibilities into separate clauses, emphasizing that the snork could be in either location. The use of \"it\" in the second clause refers back to \"the snork,\" maintaining the same subject as the original statement.\n\nSince both the original statement and the proposed inference express the same idea - that the snork is possibly in one of two locations - the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
