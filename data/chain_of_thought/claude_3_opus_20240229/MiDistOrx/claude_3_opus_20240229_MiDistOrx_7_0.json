The original statement \"The frazzle might be snizzle or blurble\" presents two possibilities - that the frazzle could be snizzle, or that it could be blurble. \nThe rephrased statement \"The frazzle might be snizzle or it might be blurble\" conveys the same idea, just broken out more explicitly into two clauses. It still presents the same two possibilities for what the frazzle could be.\nSince the meaning of the two statements is logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the rephrased version from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
