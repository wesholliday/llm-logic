            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\"\n   - \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\"\n\n2) The first statement can be rephrased as:\n   - \"It's possible that the sunglasses are not perched on her head\"\n\n3) The second statement is a disjunction (an \"either-or\" statement), which means at least one of the two parts must be true.\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that it's possible that the first part of the disjunction (\"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\") is false.\n\n5) If the first part of a disjunction is false, then for the disjunction to be true (which it must be, given the information), the second part must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" is false, then \"they are in her bag\" must be true.\n\n7) Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" to be false, we can infer that in this case, \"they are in her bag\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
