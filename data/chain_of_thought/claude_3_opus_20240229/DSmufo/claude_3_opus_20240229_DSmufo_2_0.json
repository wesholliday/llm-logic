            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\"\n   - \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\"\n\n2) The first statement can be rephrased as:\n   - \"It is possible that the book is not resting on the table\"\n\n3) The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either-or\" situation):\n   - The book must be resting on the table, OR\n   - The book is on the shelf\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that it's possible that the book is not on the table. This means that the first part of the disjunction in the second statement (\"The book must be resting on the table\") is not necessarily true.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one part is not true, then the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"The book must be resting on the table\" is not necessarily true, then \"The book is on the shelf\" must be true, given that the disjunction in the second statement is assumed to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
