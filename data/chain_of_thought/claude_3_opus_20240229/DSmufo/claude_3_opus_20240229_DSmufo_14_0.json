It states that one of two things must be true:\n   - The milk is chilling in the fridge, or\n   - The milk is on the counter\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that it's not necessarily the case that the milk is chilling in the fridge. In other words, the milk might not be in the fridge.\n\n5) If the milk is not in the fridge, and we know that it must be either in the fridge or on the counter (from the second statement), then the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
