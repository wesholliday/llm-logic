This means the first part of the disjunction in the second statement is not necessarily true.\n\n5) However, for the disjunction to be true, if one part is not necessarily true, the other part must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"The shoes must be lined up by the door\" is not necessarily true, then \"The shoes are in the closet\" must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes"
