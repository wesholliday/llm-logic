The toy may or may not be on the bookshelf.\n\n5) However, the second statement tells us that if the first possibility is not true, then the second one must be true. In other words, if the toy is not on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
