It states that one of two possibilities must be true:\n   - The umbrella is tucked away in the closet, OR\n   - The umbrella is in the car\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that the first possibility in the disjunction is not true. The umbrella is not tucked away in the closet.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one of the possibilities is false, then the other must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, since the first possibility is false, the second possibility must be true: The umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
