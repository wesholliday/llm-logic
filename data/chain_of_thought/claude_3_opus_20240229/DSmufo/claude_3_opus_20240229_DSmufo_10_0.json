In other words, it might be under the bed, but it's not certain.\n\n3) Statement (b) presents an either/or situation: the sock is either definitely under the bed, or it's in the laundry basket. There are no other options given.\n\n4) Now, statement (a) rules out the first option in statement (b). If the sock is not necessarily under the bed, then it can't be the case that it must be under the bed.\n\n5) With the first option in statement (b) eliminated, we are left with only the second option: the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
