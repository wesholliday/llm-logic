There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4) From the first statement, we know the pen is not definitely on the desk. \n\n5) Looking at the second statement, if the pen is not definitely on the desk, the only other option is that it's in the bag.\n\n6) Therefore, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the pen is in the bag. If it's not definitely on the desk, and the only other possibility is the bag, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
