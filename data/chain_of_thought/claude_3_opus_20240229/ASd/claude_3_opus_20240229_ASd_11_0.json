This means that getting enough sleep is sufficient to not be tired.\n\n2) The question is asking whether we can infer: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\". \n\n3) This new statement is adding an additional condition - doing hard labor - to the original sufficient condition of getting enough sleep.\n\n4) However, doing hard labor is likely to make you tired, even if you have gotten enough sleep. The original statement doesn't account for this additional factor that could lead to tiredness.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot confidently infer that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\". The additional condition of hard labor undermines the sufficiency of getting enough sleep for not being tired.\n\nAnswer: no"
