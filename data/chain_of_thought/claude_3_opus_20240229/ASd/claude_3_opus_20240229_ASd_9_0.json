            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\". This is a conditional statement. It states that a well-written essay is sufficient for getting an A.\n\n2) The question is asking whether we can infer: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\".\n\n3) This new statement adds an additional condition - that the essay is turned in late. \n\n4) The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if the essay is turned in late. It's possible that turning in a well-written essay late could result in a lower grade, depending on the teacher's policy.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one. The original statement is not enough to conclude that a well-written but late essay will still get an A.\n\nAnswer: no"
