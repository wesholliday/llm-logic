This means that filling up the gas tank is sufficient for the car to run.\n\n2) The second statement adds a new condition: \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run\". \n\n3) If there is a hole in the gas tank, then even if you fill it up, the gas will leak out and the car will not have the fuel it needs to run.\n\n4) Therefore, the additional condition (the hole in the gas tank) negates the sufficiency of filling up the gas tank. With a hole, filling up the tank is no longer enough to make the car run.\n\n5) So, the second statement does not follow logically from the first. We cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
