This would likely cause a delay in the package arriving.\n\n5) So even if the package has shipped, if it was misrouted, it's not guaranteed to arrive today. The additional condition of misrouting undermines the sufficiency of shipping for same-day arrival.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one. The original statement does not consider the possibility of misrouting, so it does not cover this case.\n\nAnswer: no"
