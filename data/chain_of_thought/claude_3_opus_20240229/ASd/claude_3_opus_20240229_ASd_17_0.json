This is a conditional statement where changing the oil is sufficient for the car running smoothly.\n\n2) The question is asking whether we can infer \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly\" from the original statement.\n\n3) The second statement introduces a new condition - the transmission being shot. This is a significant change from the original statement.\n\n4) A car with a shot transmission will not run smoothly, regardless of the oil being changed. The original statement does not account for other potential issues with the car, like a faulty transmission.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. The first statement alone is not enough to conclude that the car will run smoothly if the oil is changed and the transmission is shot.\n\nAnswer: no"
