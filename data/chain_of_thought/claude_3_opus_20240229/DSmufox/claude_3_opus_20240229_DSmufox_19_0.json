In other words, it's possible that the smonk is not plagged.\n\n2) We are also told \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\". This is an either/or statement. It means one of these two things must be true - either the smonk must be plagged, or the smonk is vreebled. \n\n3) From step 1, we know the smonk does not have to be plagged. So the first part of the either/or statement in step 2 is not true.\n\n4) In an either/or statement, if one part is not true, the other part must be true. Since \"the smonk must be plagged\" is not true, then \"the smonk is vreebled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
