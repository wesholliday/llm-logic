This is equivalent to saying \"The whiffle does not have to be tinked\". \n\n2) We are also given \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked\". This is a disjunction - it says one of the two options must be true. \n\n3) From 1), we know the first option in 2) is false - it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one option is false, the other must be true in order for the whole statement to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since the first option is false, the second option must be true in order for the disjunction in 2) to be true.\n\n6) The second option in 2) is \"it is shanked\", referring to the whiffle. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the statement \"The whiffle is shanked\" must be true, given the two statements we started with.\n\nAnswer: yes"
