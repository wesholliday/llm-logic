In other words, it might be zimmed, but it's not required to be.\n\n3) The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the flug must be zimmed, or it is blummed. \n\n4) From the first statement, we know that the flug does not have to be zimmed. So in the second statement, the first possibility (that the flug must be zimmed) is ruled out.\n\n5) That leaves us with the second possibility from the second statement: the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
