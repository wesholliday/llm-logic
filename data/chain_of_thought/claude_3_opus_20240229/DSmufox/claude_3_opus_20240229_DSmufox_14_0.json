In other words, the clug does not have to be snugged. \n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or situation - either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know the first part of the either/or in the second statement is false - the clug does not have to be snugged.\n\n4) In an either/or statement, if one part is false, the other part must be true in order for the whole statement to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since the clug does not have to be snugged, for the second statement to be true it must be the case that the clug is fleeked.\n\nSo, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
