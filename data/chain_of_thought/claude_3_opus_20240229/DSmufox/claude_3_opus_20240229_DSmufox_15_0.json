This means that it is not necessary for the dreb to be spened. In other words, the dreb might be spened, or it might not be.\n\n2) The second statement is \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed\". This is an either/or statement. It means that one of these two things must be true: either the dreb must be spened, or the dreb is vroombed.\n\n3) Now, from the first statement, we know that it's not true that the dreb must be spened. \n\n4) Therefore, in the either/or statement, the first part (\"the dreb must be spened\") cannot be true.\n\n5) In an either/or statement, if one part is not true, then the other part must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, the second part of the either/or statement must be true: the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
