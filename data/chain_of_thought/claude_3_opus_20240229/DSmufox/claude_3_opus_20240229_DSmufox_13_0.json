In other words, the glip being tragged is not a necessity.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the glip must be tragged, or it is slogged. \n\n3) From the first statement, we know that the first part of the either/or in the second statement is false - it is not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\n4) In an either/or statement, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the statement \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\" is true, and we know from the first statement that \"the glip must be tragged\" is false, then the other part, \"it is slogged\", must be true.\n\n6) So yes, from these two statements together, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
