In other words, there are cases where the flugel is not zargled.\n\n2) The second statement presents a disjunction (an either/or): either the flugel must be zargled, or it is blimmed. \n\n3) From 1), we know that the first disjunct (\"the flugel must be zargled\") is false. \n\n4) In a disjunction, if one disjunct is false, the other must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, for the second statement to be true, the second disjunct (\"it is blimmed\") must be true.\n\n6) So yes, from those two statements together, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
