It states that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - \"The sneg must be sproted\"\n   - \"The sneg is crampled\"\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that \"The sneg must be sproted\" is not true.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, since \"The sneg must be sproted\" is not true, for the disjunction to be true, \"The sneg is crampled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
