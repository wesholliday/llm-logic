In other words, the wug being garpled is not a certainty.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the wug must be garpled, or it is sproinged. \n\n3) From the first statement, we know that the first option in the either/or (the wug must be garpled) is not true.\n\n4) In an either/or statement, if one option is not true, then the other option must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since the wug is not necessarily garpled (from statement 1), and it is either garpled or sproinged (from statement 2), we can conclude that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
