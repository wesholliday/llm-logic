In other words, the fleeg may or may not be surned.\n\n2) The second statement gives us a disjunction (an either/or): either the fleeg must be surned, or it is bluttered. \n\n3) From the first statement, we know that the first part of the disjunction in the second statement (\"the fleeg must be surned\") is not necessarily true.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if \"the fleeg must be surned\" is not true, then for the second statement to be true, \"the fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\nSo, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
