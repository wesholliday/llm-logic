In other words, it might be movated, or it might not be - we don't know for sure that it must be.\n\n3) The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the flob must be movated, or it is skizzled. \n\n4) From the first statement, we know that it's not true that the flob must be movated. So in the second statement, the first possibility (that the flob must be movated) cannot be true.\n\n5) In an \"either A or B\" statement, if A is false, then B must be true. \n\n6) Therefore, since \"the flob must be movated\" is false, the other possibility, \"it is skizzled\", must be true.\n\nSo yes, from the two given statements, we can logically conclude that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
