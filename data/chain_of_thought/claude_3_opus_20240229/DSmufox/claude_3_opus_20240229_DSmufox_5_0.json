In other words, the zinger being smoogled is not necessary or required.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the zinger must be smoogled, or it is fraggled. These are presented as the only two possibilities.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that the first possibility in the second statement (the zinger must be smoogled) is not true. \n\n4) Since the two possibilities in statement 2 are presented as the only options, and we've ruled out the first one, the second one must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
