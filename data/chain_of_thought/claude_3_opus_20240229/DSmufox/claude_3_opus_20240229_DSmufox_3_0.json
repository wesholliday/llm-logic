In other words, it's possible that the splat is not quanked.\n\n3) The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the splat must be quanked, or it is morphed. \n\n4) Now, from the first statement, we know that it's not true that the splat must be quanked. So in the second statement, the first possibility (that the splat must be quanked) is ruled out.\n\n5) Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the splat is morphed.\n\n6) So, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
