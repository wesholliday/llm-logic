            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\". This means that it's possible that the book is not on the table. But it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that the book is on the table - it just says it's not necessarily on the table.\n\n2) The second statement says \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these two options must be true. \n\n3) Now, if we knew for certain that the book is not on the table, then from the second statement we could indeed infer that the book must be on the shelf. \n\n4) However, the first statement doesn't give us that certainty. It only says that it's not necessarily true that the book is on the table. It leaves open the possibility that the book might still be on the table, just not necessarily.\n\n5) So while the second statement limits us to two possibilities (shelf or table), the first statement doesn't completely eliminate the 'table' possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can't be certain that the book is on the shelf. It might be, but it could also still be on the table.\n\nAnswer: no"
