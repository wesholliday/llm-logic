In other words, they might be perched on her head, but they don't have to be.\n\n3) The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the sunglasses are in her bag, or they must be perched on her head.\n\n4) Now, from the first statement, we know that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This eliminates the second possibility in the second statement.\n\n5) With one of the possibilities eliminated, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
