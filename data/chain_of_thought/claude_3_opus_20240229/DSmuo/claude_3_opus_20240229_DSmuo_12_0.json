It says that one of these two things must be true:\n   - The jacket is draped over the chair\n   - The jacket must be hanging in the closet\n\n4) From the first statement, we know that the second option in the either/or statement is not necessarily true. The jacket doesn't have to be in the closet.\n\n5) In an either/or situation, if one option is not true, then the other option must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, since the jacket doesn't have to be in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
