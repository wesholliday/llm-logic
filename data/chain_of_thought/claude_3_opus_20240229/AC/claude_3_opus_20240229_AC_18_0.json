            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The truck was metal\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, this does not mean that the reverse is necessarily true. In other words, just because the truck was metal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.\n\n4) Consider this example: Let's say the truck is always metal, regardless of what the doll is made of. In this case, the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" would still be true, because whenever the doll is plastic, the truck is indeed metal. But the truck being metal doesn't imply anything about the doll.\n\n5) The second statement \"The truck was metal\" doesn't give us any information about the doll.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements alone that \"The doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: no"
