            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The software must have been updated and restarted\" is a conjunction of two propositions:\n1. The software must have been updated.\n2. The software must have been restarted.\n\nIn propositional logic, when a conjunction is true, both of its component propositions must also be true. This is known as the \"elimination rule\" for conjunction.\n\nTherefore, if we know that \"The software must have been updated and restarted\" is true, we can infer that each of its components, including \"The software must have been updated,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
