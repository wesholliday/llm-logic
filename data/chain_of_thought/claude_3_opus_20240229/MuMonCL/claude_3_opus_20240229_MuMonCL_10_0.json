            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" contains two requirements: the document must have been signed, and it must have been notarized. These two conditions are connected by the word \"and,\" which means both of them need to be satisfied.\n\nIn logic, when we have a statement in the form \"A and B,\" if the entire statement is true, then each individual part (A and B) must also be true. This is known as the \"rule of conjunction.\"\n\nIn this case, \"The document must have been signed\" is one part of the original statement. If the original statement is true (i.e., the document must have been signed and notarized), then it necessarily follows that the document must have been signed, as this is a requirement for the original statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The document must have been signed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
