The medicine must have been taken with food.\n2. The medicine must have been taken twice daily.\n\nSince the two requirements are connected by the word \"and,\" both conditions must be satisfied. In other words, the medicine needs to be taken with food, and it also needs to be taken twice a day.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The medicine must have been taken with food\" from the original statement because it is explicitly mentioned as one of the necessary conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes"
