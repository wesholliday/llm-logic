            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The meeting must have been at 2 PM\n2. The meeting must have been in the conference room\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. This is known as the rule of conjunction.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, then both parts must be true independently. In other words, if it is true that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room,\" then it must also be true that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" and \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" separately.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
