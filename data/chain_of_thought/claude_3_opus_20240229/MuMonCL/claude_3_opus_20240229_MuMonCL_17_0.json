The report must have been accurate\n2. The report must have been submitted by noon\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and\", both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. This means that each individual statement must be true on its own.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can infer that \"The report must have been accurate\" is true, because it is one of the necessary conditions for the entire statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
