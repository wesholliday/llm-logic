            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" is a compound statement that consists of two parts connected by the word \"and\":\n1. The concert must have been sold out\n2. The concert started at 8 PM\n\nIn logic, when a compound statement is connected by \"and\", both parts of the statement must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each part of the statement must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the first part of the statement is \"The concert must have been sold out\". Since the entire statement is assumed to be true, we can infer that this part of the statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
