            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The package must have been delivered today\n2. The package was signed for\n\nThe use of \"and\" implies that both parts of the statement are true. In other words, for the original statement to be true, it must be the case that the package was delivered today AND that it was signed for.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer \"The package must have been delivered today\" from the original statement. Since this is one of the two parts that make up the original statement, and both parts are required to be true for the original statement to be true, we can indeed make this inference. If the original statement is true, then it must also be true that the package was delivered today.\n\nAnswer: yes"
