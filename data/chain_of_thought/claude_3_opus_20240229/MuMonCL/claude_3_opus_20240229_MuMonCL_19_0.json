The application must have been completed online\n2. The application included references\n\nThe word \"and\" indicates that both parts of the statement must be true. In other words, for the entire statement to be true, it is necessary that the application was completed online and that it included references.\n\nSince the first part of the statement, \"The application must have been completed online,\" is directly stated as a requirement in the original statement, we can logically infer that this part is true on its own.\n\nAnswer: yes"
