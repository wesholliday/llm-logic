In other words, they could be in the pantry, or they could be somewhere else.\n\n3) The second statement gives us two possibilities: the cookies are definitely in the pantry, or they are in the jar. There are no other options given.\n\n4) Now, if we consider both statements together, the first statement rules out the possibility of the cookies definitely being in the pantry. \n\n5) Since the second statement only gives us two options (pantry or jar), and the first statement eliminates the pantry option, we are left with only one possibility: the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
