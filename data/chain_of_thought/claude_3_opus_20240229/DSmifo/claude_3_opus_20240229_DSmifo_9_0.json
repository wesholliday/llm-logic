However, it doesn't definitively say that the piece is not on the floor.\n\n3) Statement (b) presents two possibilities: either the piece is blending in on the floor, or it is in the box. These are presented as the only two options.\n\n4) If we were to infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\", we would need to be certain that it is not blending in on the floor.\n\n5) However, statement (a) only suggests that it might not be on the floor, not that it definitely isn't. There's still a possibility that it is on the floor, even if it's not certain.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't be certain that the piece is in the box. It could still possibly be on the floor, even though it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no"
