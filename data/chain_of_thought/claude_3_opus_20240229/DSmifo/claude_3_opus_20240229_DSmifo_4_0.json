However, it doesn't definitively say that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\n3) The second statement presents an either/or scenario: the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch. \n\n4) If we could definitively say that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then based on the second statement, we could infer that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\n5) However, the first statement only says that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom. There's still a possibility that the cat is playing in the bedroom.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't definitively infer that the cat is napping on the couch. The cat could still be playing in the bedroom, despite the possibility presented in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
