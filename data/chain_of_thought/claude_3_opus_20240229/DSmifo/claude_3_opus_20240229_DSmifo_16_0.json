There are no other options.\n\n4) Now, if we try to infer \"The pen is in my bag\", we would need to be certain that the pen is not on the desk. \n\n5) However, the first statement only says the pen might not be on the desk, not that it definitely isn't. So there's still a possibility it could be on the desk.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't be certain that \"The pen is in my bag\". The pen could still possibly be on the desk, based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
