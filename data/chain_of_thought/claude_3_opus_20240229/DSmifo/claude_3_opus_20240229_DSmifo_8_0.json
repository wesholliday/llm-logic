However, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that it could be under the couch.\n\n3) The second statement presents a disjunction: it states that one of two possibilities must be true - either the remote is under the couch, or it's on the coffee table.\n\n4) If we were to infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\", we would need to be certain that it's not under the couch. \n\n5) However, the first statement only says that the remote \"might not\" be under the couch, not that it definitely isn't. There's still a possibility that it could be under the couch.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't be certain that the remote is on the coffee table. The possibility that it's under the couch hasn't been completely eliminated.\n\nAnswer: no"
