The proposed inference is \"The frazzle must be gribble quimble quorple\". \n\nThe original statement asserts two things about the frazzle:\n1) It must be quazzle\n2) It must be gribble quimble quorple\n\nThe proposed inference only asserts the second part - that the frazzle must be gribble quimble quorple. It omits the requirement that the frazzle must also be quazzle.\n\nSince the inference leaves out a key part of what was originally stated about the frazzle, we cannot logically make this inference. The inference is not equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
