This means the quimble must satisfy two conditions:\n1) It must be crunk zizz \n2) It must be glorp zooble gronk\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"The quimble must be glorp zooble gronk\". This is stating only the second condition from the original statement.\n\nIn logic, if A and B are true, then we can always infer that A is true by itself, and B is true by itself. But if only given that A is true, or only given that B is true, we cannot infer that both A and B are true together.\n\nTherefore, given the original statement that the quimble must satisfy both condition 1 and condition 2, we can validly infer the simpler statement that the quimble must satisfy condition 2.\n\nAnswer: yes"
