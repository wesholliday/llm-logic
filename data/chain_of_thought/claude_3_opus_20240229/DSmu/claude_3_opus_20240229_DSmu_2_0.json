It says that one of two things must be true: either the book is on the shelf, or the book must be on the table.\n\n3) The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the book must be on the table.\n\n4) In logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q), and we know that one part of the disjunction is false (not Q), then we can infer that the other part must be true (P).\n\n5) Applying this to our statements:\n   - P: \"The book is on the shelf\"\n   - Q: \"The book must be resting on the table\"\n   - We know \"not Q\" is true\n\n6) Therefore, since we have \"P or Q\" and \"not Q\", we can infer that \"P\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
