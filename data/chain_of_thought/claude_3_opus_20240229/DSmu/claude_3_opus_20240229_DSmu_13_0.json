In other words, either the toy is in the box, or it must be on the shelf, or both.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the second part of the disjunction in (a). It says that it's not true that the toy must be on the shelf.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n   - From (a), we know the toy is either in the box or on the shelf.\n   - From (b), we know it's not true that the toy must be on the shelf.\n   - Therefore, the toy doesn't have to be on the shelf.\n   - But from (a), we know it has to be either in the box or on the shelf.\n   - So if it doesn't have to be on the shelf, it must be in the box.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
