In other words, either the pen is in the bag, or the pen must be on the desk, or both.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the second part of the disjunction in (a). It states that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n\n4) If we combine these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n   - If the pen is not necessarily on the desk (from statement b),\n   - And either the pen is in the bag or it must be on the desk (from statement a),\n   - Then it must be the case that the pen is in the bag.\n\n5) This is because statement (b) eliminates the possibility of the pen being on the desk, leaving only one possibility from statement (a) - that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
