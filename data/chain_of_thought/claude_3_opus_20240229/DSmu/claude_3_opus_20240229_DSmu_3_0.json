There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the keys must be in the cabinet.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the two possibilities presented in statement (a).\n\n5) The only remaining possibility from statement (a) is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept the truth of both given statements, we can indeed infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
