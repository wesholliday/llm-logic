We can represent the statements as follows:\n\nLet p = \"The shoes are in the closet\"\nLet q = \"The shoes must be lined up by the door\"\n\nThe first statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" can be represented as a disjunction:\np \u2228 q\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\" can be represented as a negation:\n\u00acq\n\nNow, we want to see if we can infer p from these two statements.\n\nIn propositional logic, there is a rule called \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" which states:\nIf we have a disjunction (p \u2228 q) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acp or \u00acq), then we can infer the other disjunct.\n\nIn this case, we have:\np \u2228 q\n\u00acq\n\nBy Disjunctive Syllogism, we can indeed infer p, which is \"The shoes are in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
