            "content": "Explanation: The two statements are very similar, with only a slight difference in wording. The first statement says \"the gribble must be flim on snork and it must blimple quazzle flim\". The second statement says \"the gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim\". \n\nThe only difference is the word \"it\" in the first statement, which is omitted in the second statement. However, this does not change the meaning of the sentence. \"It\" in the first sentence refers to \"the gribble\", so saying \"the gribble must blimple quazzle flim\" means the same thing as \"it must blimple quazzle flim\", where \"it\" refers to the gribble.\n\nTherefore, since the two statements have the same meaning, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
