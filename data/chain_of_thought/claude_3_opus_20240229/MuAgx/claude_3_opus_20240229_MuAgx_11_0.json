            "content": "Explanation: The two statements are logically equivalent. The original statement \"The glorp must be wobble and it must be zooble\" means that for something to be a glorp, it is required to have both the properties of being wobble and being zooble. \n\nThe rephrased statement \"The glorp must be wobble and zooble\" conveys the same meaning - that a glorp must possess both the wobble and zooble properties. The only difference is the second \"it must be\" is omitted, but this does not change the logical meaning.\n\nSince the two statements have the same logical implications about the required properties of a glorp, we can indeed infer the rephrased version from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes"
