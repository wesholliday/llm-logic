            "content": "Explanation: The two statements are very similar, with only a small difference:\n\nOriginal: \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and it must frazzle at wozzle zump\"\nProposed inference: \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump\"\n\nThe only difference is the removal of \"it must\" in the second part of the sentence. \n\nLogically, if the wobble must be wumble fizzle, and it must frazzle at wozzle zump, then it follows that the wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump. The \"it must\" is implied in the shortened version.\n\nSo yes, the proposed inference logically follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
