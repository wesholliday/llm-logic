            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The quibble must be froodle quank or frazzle fribble\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the parts must be true for the whole statement to be true. We are told that \"The quibble must be froodle quank\" is true. If that part of the disjunction is true, then it doesn't matter whether \"frazzle fribble\" is true or not - the whole disjunction \"The quibble must be froodle quank or frazzle fribble\" must be true. So yes, we can validly infer the disjunction from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
