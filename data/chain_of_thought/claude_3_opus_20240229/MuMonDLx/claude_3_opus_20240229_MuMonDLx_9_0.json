In other words, all zibbles are glorp.\n\nThe statement \"The zibble must be glorp or plonk\" means that being either glorp or plonk is a necessary condition for being a zibble. In other words, all zibbles are either glorp or plonk (or both).\n\nIf all zibbles are glorp, then it logically follows that all zibbles are either glorp or plonk, because any zibble that is glorp satisfies the condition of being \"glorp or plonk\".\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The zibble must be glorp\", we can indeed infer that \"The zibble must be glorp or plonk\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
