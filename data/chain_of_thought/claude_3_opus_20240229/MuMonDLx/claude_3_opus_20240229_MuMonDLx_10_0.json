We are told that \"The frazzle must be froodle\". If the frazzle must be froodle, then the disjunction \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble\" must also be true, regardless of whether \"The frazzle must be wobble\" is true or not. The truth of one of the disjuncts is sufficient to make the entire disjunction true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
