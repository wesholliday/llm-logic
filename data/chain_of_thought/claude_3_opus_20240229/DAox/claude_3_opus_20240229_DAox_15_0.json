            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the statement \"The dreb was not vroombed\". Let's call this statement P.\n\n2. We are also given the conditional statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". We can rewrite this as \"If P, then Q\", where Q represents the statement \"The dreb was spened\".\n\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer the statement \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given information. Let's call this statement not-Q.\n\n4. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we also know \"not-Q\", then we can infer \"not-P\".\n\n5. However, in this case, we don't have \"not-Q\". Instead, we have \"not-P\" from the first given statement.\n\n6. From \"not-P\" and \"If P, then Q\", we cannot infer \"not-Q\". This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when P is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
