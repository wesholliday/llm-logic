It states that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, from the first statement, we know that \"the fleeg was not bluttered\". In other words, the condition in the second statement is not met.\n\n4) When the condition of an if-then statement is not met, we cannot make any conclusion about the consequence. The consequence could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot determine whether \"the fleeg did not surn\". It might have surned, or it might not have surned. We simply don't have enough information to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no"
