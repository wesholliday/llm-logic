In other words, if Joe did not go to the park, we cannot conclude anything about Lucy going to the zoo.\n\n2) The second statement tells us that \"Joe went to the park.\" This satisfies the condition in the first statement.\n\n3) Since the condition is satisfied, we can conclude that the consequence must also be true. In other words, since Joe went to the park, it must also be true that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes"
