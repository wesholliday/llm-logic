            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement: Lisa buying the red shirt is the condition, and Mark buying the blue shirt is the consequence.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that Lisa did in fact buy the red shirt. This means the condition in the first statement has been met.\n\n3. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition is also true, then the consequence must be true as well.\n\n4. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - The conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n   - The condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is also true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must be true.\n\nSo, based on the given statements and the rules of logic, we can indeed infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
