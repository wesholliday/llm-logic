The first statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Since the condition in the first statement is true, and the first statement tells us that if the condition is true, the conclusion must be true, we can infer that the conclusion \"the truck was metal\" is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
