            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   - The car was red.\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional statement. It states that if a certain condition is met (the car being red), then a certain consequence follows (the truck being blue).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the car was indeed red.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens. It states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (antecedent) is also true, then the consequence (consequent) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"the car was red\" is also stated to be true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"the truck was blue\" must be true as well.\n\n6) So, based on the given statements and the rule of Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: yes"
