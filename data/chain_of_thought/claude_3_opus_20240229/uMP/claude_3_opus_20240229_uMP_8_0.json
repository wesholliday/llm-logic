            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   - The vampire was awake.\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake. In other words, if the vampire is awake, it necessarily means the mummy is awake too.\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition (the \"if\" part) of the first statement. It states that the vampire was indeed awake.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then we can infer that the consequence (the \"then\" part) is true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is given as true.\n   - The condition \"the vampire was awake\" is also given as true.\n   - Therefore, we can infer that the consequence \"the mummy was awake\" is true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes"
