            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n   - Tom watched football.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\n3. The second statement affirms that the condition in the first statement, \"Tom watched football,\" is indeed true.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement and we know that the condition (the \"if\" part) is true, we can infer that the consequence (the \"then\" part) must also be true. This is known as the law of detachment or modus ponens.\n\n5. Therefore, since we know that \"Tom watched football\" is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can infer that \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
