            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   - The book was written by James.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement. It states that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain conclusion follows (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n3. The second statement affirms the condition of the first statement. It states that the book was indeed written by James.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement and we affirm the condition, we can infer the conclusion. This is known as the modus ponens rule of inference.\n\n5. Applying modus ponens to our statements:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (conditional)\n   - The book was written by James. (affirming the condition)\n   - Therefore, the book is a mystery novel. (conclusion)\n\nSo, based on the given statements and the rules of logical inference, we can indeed infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes"
