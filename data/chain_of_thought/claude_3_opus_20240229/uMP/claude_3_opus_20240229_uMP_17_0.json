The first statement is a conditional: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Ben ate pasta.\" This means the condition in the first statement is indeed true.\n\n3. Since the condition is true, and we have a rule that says if the condition is true then the consequence must also be true, we can infer that the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" is true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: yes"
