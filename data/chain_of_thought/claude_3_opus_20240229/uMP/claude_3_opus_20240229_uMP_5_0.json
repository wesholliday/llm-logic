The first statement is a conditional: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Jeff played basketball.\" This means the condition in the first statement is indeed true.\n\n3. Since the condition is true, and we have a conditional statement, we can conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, yes, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes"
