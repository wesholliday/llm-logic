It means that if the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\n2. \"The apple was red.\" This statement affirms that the condition in the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, let's apply the rule of inference called Modus Ponens:\n- If P (the apple was red) implies Q (the banana was yellow), and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- P (the apple was red) implies Q (the banana was yellow)\n- P (the apple was red) is true\n\nTherefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer that Q (the banana was yellow) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
