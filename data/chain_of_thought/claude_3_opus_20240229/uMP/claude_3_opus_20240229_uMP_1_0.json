In other words, if Mary is at the wedding, we can be sure that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\n2) The second statement tells us that \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This is the condition in the first statement.\n\n3) Since the condition in the first statement is met (Mary was at the wedding), we can apply the conditional and conclude that the consequence must also be true (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
