            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   - The shirt was cotton.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement. It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the consequence \"the pants were denim\" must also be true.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is indeed true.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a true conditional statement and we know that its condition is true, we can infer that the consequence must also be true. This is known as the law of detachment or modus ponens.\n\n5. Applying the law of detachment to our statements:\n   - The conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true.\n   - The condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true.\n   - Therefore, we can infer that the consequence \"the pants were denim\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
