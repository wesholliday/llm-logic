There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) suggests that there's a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet. It doesn't say they definitely aren't, but it introduces doubt.\n\n4) If we combine these statements, we have:\n   - The keys are either in the drawer or in the cabinet.\n   - The keys might not be in the cabinet.\n\n5) If the keys might not be in the cabinet, then we can't be certain they are in the cabinet. But we know they are either in the drawer or in the cabinet.\n\n6) Therefore, if we can't be sure about the cabinet, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n7) So, based on the given statements, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
