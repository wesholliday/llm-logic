It suggests that the sock being under the bed is not certain.\n\n4) However, statement (b) does not completely rule out the possibility of the sock being under the bed. It just says it \"might not\" be there, which means it could still be there.\n\n5) For the inference \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\" to be valid, we would need to be certain that the sock is not under the bed. But statement (b) does not give us that certainty.\n\n6) Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: no"
