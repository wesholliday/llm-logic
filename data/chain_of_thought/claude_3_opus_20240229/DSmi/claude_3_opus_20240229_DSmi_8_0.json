There are no other options given.\n\n3) The second statement suggests that there's a possibility that the remote is not under the couch. It doesn't say for certain that it's not under the couch, just that it might not be.\n\n4) If the remote might not be under the couch, that means there's still a possibility that it is under the couch. \n\n5) So the second statement doesn't eliminate the possibility of the remote being under the couch.\n\n6) Therefore, we can't be certain that the remote is on the coffee table. It could still be under the couch, based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
