This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these two options must be true. Let's call \"the book is on the shelf\" proposition P, and \"the book is resting on the table\" proposition Q.\n\n   So the first statement can be symbolized as: P \u2228 Q\n\n2) The second statement says \"The book might not be resting on the table\". This suggests that Q might be false. But it doesn't say that Q is definitely false.\n\n3) Now, the question is whether we can infer P (that the book is on the shelf) from these two statements.\n\n4) If we knew that Q was definitely false, then yes, we could infer P. Because if Q is false, then given the first statement (P \u2228 Q), P would have to be true.\n\n5) However, the second statement doesn't say that Q is definitely false, only that it might be false. So we can't be certain that P is true.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no"
