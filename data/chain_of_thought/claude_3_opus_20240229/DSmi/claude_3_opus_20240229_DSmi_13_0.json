This means that the toy can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n2) The second statement says \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\". This means there's a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n\n3) If the toy is not on the bookshelf, and we know from the first statement that it can only be either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\n4) However, the second statement doesn't say that the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf, only that it might not be. There's still a possibility that it is on the bookshelf.\n\n5) Therefore, we can't say for certain that the toy is in the toy box. It could be, but it could also be on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: no"
