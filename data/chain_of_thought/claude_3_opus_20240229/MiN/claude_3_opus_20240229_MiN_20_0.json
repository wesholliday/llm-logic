This means there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\n2) The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\".\n\n3) If something \"must\" be true, that means there is no possibility of it not being true. It is necessarily true.\n\n4) The original statement says there is a possibility of the sunglasses not being in her bag. This directly contradicts the idea that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag, then it cannot be the case that they must be in her bag.\n\n6) So, from the original statement, we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
