This means there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\n2) The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\".\n\n3) If something \"must\" be the case, that means there is no possibility of it not being the case. It's a certainty.\n\n4) The original statement says there is a possibility of the watch not charging on the dresser. This directly contradicts the idea that the watch \"must\" be charging on the dresser.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser, then it cannot be the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\n6) So, the inference \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" follows logically from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
