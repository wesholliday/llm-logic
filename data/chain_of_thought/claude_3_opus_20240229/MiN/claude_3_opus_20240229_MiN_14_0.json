In other words, it's not certain that the milk is on the counter.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' means it's not necessary or obligatory for the milk to be on the counter.\n\n3) If it's possible that the milk is not on the counter (as stated in the first sentence), then it logically follows that it's not necessary or obligatory for the milk to be on the counter.\n\n4) In other words, if there's a chance the milk isn't on the counter, then it can't be the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, from 'The milk might not be on the counter', we can indeed infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
