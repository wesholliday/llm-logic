In other words, it's not certain that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair' means that it's not necessary or obligatory for the jacket to be draped over the chair.\n\n3) If it's possible that the jacket is not draped over the chair (as stated in the first sentence), then it logically follows that it's not necessary or obligatory for the jacket to be draped over the chair.\n\n4) In other words, if there's a chance the jacket isn't draped over the chair, then it can't be the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, from 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair', we can indeed infer 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
