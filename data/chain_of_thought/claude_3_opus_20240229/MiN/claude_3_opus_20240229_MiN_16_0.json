In other words, it's not certain that the pen is in the bag.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag' means it's not necessarily true that the pen is in the bag. In other words, there is no certainty or obligation for the pen to be in the bag.\n\n3) Both statements express the idea that there is no certainty about the pen being in the bag. The first statement says it might not be there, while the second says it's not necessarily there.\n\n4) Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent. If it might not be in the bag, then it's not the case that it must be in the bag, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes"
