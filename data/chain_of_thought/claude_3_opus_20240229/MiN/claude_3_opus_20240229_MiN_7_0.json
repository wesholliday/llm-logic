In other words, it is not certain that Alex finished the race.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\". This means that it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race. \n\n3) If Alex might not have finished the race (as stated in the first statement), then it cannot be the case that Alex must have finished the race. If there's a possibility he didn't finish, then it's not certain (or \"must be true\") that he did finish.\n\n4) Therefore, the second statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" follows logically from the first statement \"Alex might not have finished the race\". If the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
