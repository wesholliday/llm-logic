In other words, it is not certain that Sue chose pizza.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\". This means that it is not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza. \n\n3) If it's not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza, then there must be a possibility that she did not choose pizza.\n\n4) This aligns with the meaning of the first statement - that there is a possibility Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" follows logically from the first statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\". If Sue might not have chosen pizza, then it cannot be the case that she must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
