In other words, it's not certain that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway' means it's not necessary or obligatory for the newspaper to be in the driveway.\n\n3) If it's possible that the newspaper is not in the driveway (as stated in the first sentence), then it logically follows that it's not necessary for the newspaper to be in the driveway.\n\n4) In other words, if there's a chance the newspaper isn't in the driveway, then we can't say it must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, from 'The newspaper might not be in the driveway', we can indeed infer 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
