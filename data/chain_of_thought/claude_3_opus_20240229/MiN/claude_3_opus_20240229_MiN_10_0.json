In other words, it's not certain that the dog was inside.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside' means it's not true that the dog was definitely inside. \n\n3) If it's not certain that the dog was inside (from 1), then it can't be true that the dog was definitely inside.\n\n4) Therefore, 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside' follows logically from 'The dog might not have been inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
