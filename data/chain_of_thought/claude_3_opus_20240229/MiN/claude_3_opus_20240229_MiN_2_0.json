This means there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n2) The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".\n\n3) If the griffin \"must have been\" in the forest, that would mean there is no possibility that it wasn't in the forest. It was definitely, 100% in the forest.\n\n4) But the original statement says there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. So it's not definite, not 100%.\n\n5) Therefore, it's true that \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\". If there's a possibility it wasn't in the forest, then it's not the case that it must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
