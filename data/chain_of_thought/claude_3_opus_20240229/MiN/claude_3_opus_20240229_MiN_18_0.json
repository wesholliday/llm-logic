In other words, it's not certain that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' means that it's not necessary or obligatory for the notebook to be in the drawer. \n\n3) If it's not certain that the notebook is in the drawer (as stated in the first sentence), then it follows that it's not necessary or obligatory for the notebook to be in the drawer.\n\n4) Therefore, from 'The notebook might not be in the drawer', we can indeed infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
