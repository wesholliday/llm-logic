This means there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. In other words, it's not certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\". This is saying that it's not true that the alien was required or compelled to visit Mars.\n\n3) If the alien was not required to visit Mars, then it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars. This aligns with the original statement.\n\n4) Therefore, if it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars, then it follows that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\n5) So, from the statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\", we can indeed infer that \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
