            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" means there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In other words, it's not certain that she bought it.\n\n2) The phrase \"might not\" indicates possibility, not certainty. It suggests that while it's possible she didn't buy the shirt, it's also possible that she did buy it.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\". \n\n4) The phrase \"must have\" indicates certainty or necessity. If Lisa must have bought the shirt, then there's no possibility that she didn't buy it.\n\n5) The second statement negates this certainty. It says it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the shirt. In other words, it's not certain that she bought it.\n\n6) This aligns with the meaning of the first statement. If it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the shirt (first statement), then it can't be certain that she bought it (second statement).\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
