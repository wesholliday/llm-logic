In other words, it is not certain that Jeff played basketball.\n\n2) The statement \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" means that it is not necessarily true that Jeff played basketball. \n\n3) If it's possible that Jeff did not play basketball (as stated in the first sentence), then it cannot be the case that Jeff must have played basketball. If Jeff must have played basketball, then it would not be possible that he did not play.\n\n4) Therefore, if \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" is true, then \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" must also be true.\n\n5) The inference from \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" to \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
