            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" can be rephrased as \"It's possible that Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\n2) The modal verb \"might\" expresses possibility. So if it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, then it's not certain that she was at the wedding.\n\n3) Now, let's look at the second statement: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\". \n\n4) The phrase \"must have been\" expresses necessity or certainty. If something must have happened, then it certainly happened.\n\n5) But the second statement negates this certainty. It's saying it's not certain that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n6) This aligns with the first statement. If it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding (first statement), then it can't be certain that she was at the wedding (second statement).\n\n7) Therefore, the second statement follows logically from the first. If the first is true, the second must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
