In other words, it's not certain that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n2) 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' means that it's not necessary or obligatory for the shoes to be in the closet. \n\n3) If it's possible that the shoes are not in the closet (as stated in the first sentence), then it can't be necessary or obligatory that they are in the closet. If it were necessary, then there would be no possibility of them not being in the closet.\n\n4) Therefore, if 'The shoes might not be in the closet' is true, then 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' must also be true.\n\n5) The inference holds. If it's possible that the shoes are not in the closet, then it can't be the case that they must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
