This means there's a possibility that someone other than James wrote the book.\n\n2) The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\". \n\n3) If it MUST have been written by James, that would mean there's no possibility of anyone else having written it.\n\n4) But the original statement says there IS a possibility someone else wrote it.\n\n5) Therefore, it can't be the case that it MUST have been written by James. If there's a chance someone else wrote it, then we can't say it must have been James.\n\n6) So yes, from the original statement, we can infer the second statement. If the book might not have been written by James, then it's not the case that it must have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
