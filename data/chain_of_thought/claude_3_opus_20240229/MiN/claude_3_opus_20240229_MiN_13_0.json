This means there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\n2) The second statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\". This means it's not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n3) If there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box (as stated in the original statement), then it logically follows that it's not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n4) In other words, if the toy might not be in the box, then it can't be the case that it must be in the box. The possibility of it not being in the box precludes the necessity of it being in the box.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
