The two statements are actually converse of each other.\n\nFor example:\nIf it rains, then the ground gets wet. (If P, then Q)\nIf the ground is wet, then it rained. (If Q, then P)\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent, as the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like someone watering the plants.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, just because the robot visited Jupiter, it doesn't necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons for the robot to visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
