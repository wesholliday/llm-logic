This is because P \u2192 Q means that if P is true, Q must be true, but it doesn't necessarily mean the converse (Q \u2192 P) is true.\n\nFor example, consider: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThis does not necessarily mean: \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\" (Q \u2192 P)\nThe ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler or a spilled drink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
