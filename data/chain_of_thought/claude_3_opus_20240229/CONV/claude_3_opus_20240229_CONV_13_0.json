In other words, if P implies Q, it does not necessarily mean that Q implies P.\n\nConsider a counterexample:\nIf it is raining, then the ground is wet. (P \u2192 Q)\nHowever, if the ground is wet, it does not necessarily mean that it is raining, as the ground could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler or a spilled drink. (Q \u219b P)\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, just because the truck being blue is a consequence of the car being red, it does not necessarily mean that the car being red is a consequence of the truck being blue. There could be other reasons for the truck being blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: no"
