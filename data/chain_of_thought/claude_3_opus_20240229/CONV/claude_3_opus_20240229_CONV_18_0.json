            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', let's consider the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' has the form:\nP \u2192 Q\nwhere P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer, 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic', has the form:\nQ \u2192 P\n\nIn general, the converse of a statement (Q \u2192 P) is not logically equivalent to the original statement (P \u2192 Q). In other words, if P \u2192 Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that Q \u2192 P is also true.\n\nConsider a counterexample:\nIf it is a dog, then it is a mammal. (True)\nIf it is a mammal, then it is a dog. (False)\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: no"
