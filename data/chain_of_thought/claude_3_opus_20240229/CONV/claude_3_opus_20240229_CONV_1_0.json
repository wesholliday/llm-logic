            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the converse of this statement, which would be \"If Q, then P\", or in this case, \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\".\n\n3) In general, the converse of a statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is a true statement, but its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n4) In this specific case, the original statement tells us that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence, but it doesn't say anything about the reverse. It's possible that Sue could have been at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
