These are called converse statements, and they are not logically equivalent.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThe converse would be: \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\" (Q \u2192 P)\nHowever, the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a spilled drink, so the converse is not necessarily true.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, Jen could have watched basketball for reasons other than Tom watching football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
