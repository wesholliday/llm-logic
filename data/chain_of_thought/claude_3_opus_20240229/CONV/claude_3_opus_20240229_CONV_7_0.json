The original statement, 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', can be represented as:\n   Alex finished (A) \u2192 Chris finished (C)\n\n2. The statement we want to infer, 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race', can be represented as:\n   Chris finished (C) \u2192 Alex finished (A)\n\n3. In propositional logic, the converse of a statement P \u2192 Q is Q \u2192 P. The converse is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n\n4. In this case, the statement we want to infer is the converse of the original statement. Just because 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' is also true.\n\n5. For example, consider a scenario where Chris always finishes the race, regardless of whether Alex finishes or not. In this case, the original statement would be true, but the converse would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' from 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: no"
