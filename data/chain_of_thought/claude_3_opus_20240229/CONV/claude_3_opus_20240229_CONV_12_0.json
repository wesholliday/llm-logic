This is generally true. However, the converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\", is not necessarily true, because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) In the given statement, just because Lucy going to the zoo follows from Joe going to the park, it doesn't necessarily mean that Joe going to the park follows from Lucy going to the zoo. Lucy could have gone to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
