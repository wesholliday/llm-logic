These are called converse statements, and they are not logically equivalent.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThe converse would be: \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\" (Q \u2192 P)\nHowever, the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a spilled drink, so the converse is not necessarily true.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, just because Erin took a train, it doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons for Erin taking a train that are not related to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
