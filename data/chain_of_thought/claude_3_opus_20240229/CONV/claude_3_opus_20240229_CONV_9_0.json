            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', let's consider the logical structure.\n\nThe original statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' has the form:\nP \u2192 Q\nwhere P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt', has the form:\nQ \u2192 P\n\nIn general, P \u2192 Q is not logically equivalent to Q \u2192 P. This is because P \u2192 Q means that if P is true, then Q must be true, but it doesn't say anything about the case when Q is true.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario:\n- Lisa bought the red shirt (P is true)\n- Mark bought the blue shirt (Q is true)\n\nIn this case, both P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 P are true.\n\nHowever, consider another scenario:\n- Lisa did not buy the red shirt (P is false)\n- Mark bought the blue shirt (Q is true)\n\nIn this case, P \u2192 Q is still true (because P is false, the implication is true regardless of Q), but Q \u2192 P is false (because Q is true, but P is false).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: no"
