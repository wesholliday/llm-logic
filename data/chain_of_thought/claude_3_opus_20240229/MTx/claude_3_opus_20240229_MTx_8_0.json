            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n   - \"The sprocket was not daggled\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true, then the consequence \"the sprocket was daggled\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the sprocket was not daggled\", which is the opposite of \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. This is because of the nature of the conditional: the consequence is guaranteed to be true only if the condition is true. If the consequence is false, the condition cannot be true.\n\n5) Applying this to our statements, since \"the sprocket was daggled\" is false (as per the second statement), then \"the sprocket was cranked\" must also be false.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
