It states that if the condition \"the smonk was vreebled\" is true, then the consequence \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the smonk did not plagged\". In other words, the consequence from the first statement is not true.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional, if the consequence is not true, then the condition cannot be true either. If it were, the conditional would be false, but we are assuming the conditional is true.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the smonk plagged\" is not true, \"the smonk was vreebled\" cannot be true either.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
