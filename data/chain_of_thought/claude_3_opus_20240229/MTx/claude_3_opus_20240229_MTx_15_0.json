It states that if we have a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acq), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acp).\n\n4) Applying Modus Tollens to our statements:\n   - \"vroombed \u2192 spened\" is our conditional (p \u2192 q)\n   - \"\u00acspened\" is the negation of the consequent (\u00acq)\n   Therefore, we can infer \"\u00acvroombed\", which is the negation of the antecedent (\u00acp).\n\n5) \"\u00acvroombed\" translates to \"The dreb was not vroombed\" in plain English.\n\nAnswer: yes"
