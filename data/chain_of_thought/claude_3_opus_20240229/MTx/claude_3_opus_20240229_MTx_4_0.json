It states that if the condition \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, then the consequence \"the fribble crinked\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the fribble did not crink\". In other words, the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional, if the consequence is false, what can we say about the condition? \n   - If the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. \n   - Why? Because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true (that's what the conditional states).\n\n5) So, if \"the fribble crinked\" is false, then \"the fribble was snurgled\" must also be false.\n\n6) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
