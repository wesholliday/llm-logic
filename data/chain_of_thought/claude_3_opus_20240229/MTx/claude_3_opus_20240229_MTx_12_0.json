It states that if the condition \"the smip was shripped\" is true, then the consequence \"the smip lupped the zoint\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the smip did not lup the zoint\".\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the condition? \n   - If the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. \n   - Why? Because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true (according to the conditional statement).\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the smip did not lup the zoint\" (the consequence is false), we can infer that \"the smip was not shripped\" (the condition must be false).\n\nAnswer: yes"
