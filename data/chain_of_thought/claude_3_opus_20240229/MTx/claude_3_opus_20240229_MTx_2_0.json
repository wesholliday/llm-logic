            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\". \n2. This can be symbolically represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the wug was flooped\", and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint\".\n3. We are also given the statement: \"The wug did not bim the zoint\". This is the negation of Q, symbolically represented as \u00acQ.\n4. From the given information, we want to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not flooped\", which is the negation of P, symbolically \u00acP.\n5. In propositional logic, there is a rule called Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, and we also have the negation of Q (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of P (\u00acP).\n6. In this case, we have the conditional statement P \u2192 Q, and we also have \u00acQ. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer \u00acP, which is \"The wug was not flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
