It states that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"The fleeg did not surn\". In other words, the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional, if the consequence is false, what can we say about the condition? \n   - If the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. \n   - Why? Because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true (according to the conditional statement).\n\n5) Therefore, since the consequence \"it surned\" is false, the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
