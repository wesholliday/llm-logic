It states that if the condition \"the twonk was plinked\" is true, then the consequence \"it was varnished\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"The twonk was not varnished\". In other words, the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"it was varnished\" is false (because we are told \"The twonk was not varnished\").\n   - Therefore, the condition \"the twonk was plinked\" must also be false.\n\n6) If \"the twonk was plinked\" is false, that means \"The twonk was not plinked\".\n\nTherefore, yes, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The twonk was not plinked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
