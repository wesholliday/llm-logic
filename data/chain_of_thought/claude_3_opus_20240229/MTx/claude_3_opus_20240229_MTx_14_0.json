It states that if the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, then the consequence \"the clug snugged\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the clug did not snugged\". In other words, the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional statement, if the consequence is false, what can we say about the condition? \n\n   If the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. \n   \n   Why? Because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true (according to the conditional statement). But we know the consequence is false. So the condition must be false.\n\n5) Applying this to our problem: The consequence \"the clug snugged\" is false. Therefore, the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" must also be false.\n\n6) So, yes, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
