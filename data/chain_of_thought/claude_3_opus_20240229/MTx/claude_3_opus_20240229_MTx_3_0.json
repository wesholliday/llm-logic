            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n   - \"The splat did not quank\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the consequence \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the splat did not quank\". In other words, the consequence from the first statement is not true.\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is not true, what can we say about the condition? \n\n5) In logic, this is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Applying this to our problem, the contrapositive of \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\".\n\n7) We know from the second statement that \"the splat did not quank\" is true. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, \"the splat was not morphed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
