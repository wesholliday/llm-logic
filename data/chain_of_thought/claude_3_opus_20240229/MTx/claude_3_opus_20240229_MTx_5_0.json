In logic, this is equivalent to saying \"fraggled zinger \u2192 smoogled zinger\". \n\n2) We are also given the statement \"The zinger was not smoogled\". Logically, this is simply \"not (smoogled zinger)\".\n\n3) What we want to prove is \"The zinger was not fraggled\", i.e., \"not (fraggled zinger)\".\n\n4) From (1), we know that if the zinger was fraggled, it must have been smoogled. \n\n5) But from (2), we know that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\n6) Therefore, it could not have been the case that the zinger was fraggled, because if it were, it would have to be smoogled, which it isn't.\n\n7) Thus, we can indeed conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
