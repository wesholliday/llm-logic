It states that if the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" is true, then the consequence \"the whiffle tinked\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the whiffle did not tink\". In other words, the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional statement, if the consequence is false, what can we say about the condition? \n   - If the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. \n   - Why? Because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true (according to the conditional statement).\n\n5) Applying this to our problem: \n   - The consequence \"the whiffle tinked\" is false (because we are told the whiffle did not tink). \n   - Therefore, the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
