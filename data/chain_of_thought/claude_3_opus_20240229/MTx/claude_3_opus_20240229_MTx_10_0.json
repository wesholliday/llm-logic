            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n   - \"The wug was not garpled\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" is true, then the consequence \"it was garpled\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that \"the wug was not garpled\". This contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens here:\n   - The conditional \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"it was garpled\" is false (because we are told \"the wug was not garpled\").\n   - Therefore, the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" must also be false.\n\n6) So, we can indeed infer that \"the wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
