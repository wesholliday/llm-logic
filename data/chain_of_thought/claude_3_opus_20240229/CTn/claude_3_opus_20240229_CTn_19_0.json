The given statement is: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\n   Let's define:\n   P: Tom watched football\n   Q: Jen watched basketball\n   \n   The given statement can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q (where ~ denotes negation)\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football'.\n   Using the same variables, this statement can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n3. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a statement (P \u2192 Q) is (~Q \u2192 ~P), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of the given statement (P \u2192 ~Q) is: ~~Q \u2192 ~P, which simplifies to Q \u2192 ~P.\n\n5. The statement we want to infer (Q \u2192 ~P) is exactly the same as the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nTherefore, since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
