Note that R is the negation of Q.\n   And \"Joe did not go to the park\" is the negation of P.\n   So the statement we're trying to infer can be written as: R \u2192 ~P\n\n3) In propositional logic, there's a rule called the contrapositive. It states that:\n   If P \u2192 Q is true, then ~Q \u2192 ~P is also true.\n\n4) Applying this rule to our original statement:\n   Given P \u2192 Q, we can infer ~Q \u2192 ~P\n\n5) But ~Q \u2192 ~P is equivalent to R \u2192 ~P, which is exactly the statement we were trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
