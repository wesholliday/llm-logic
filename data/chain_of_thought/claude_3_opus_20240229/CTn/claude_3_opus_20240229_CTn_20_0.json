            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow', let's consider the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow' has the form:\nP \u2192 not Q\nwhere P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was yellow'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red', has the form:\nQ \u2192 not P\n\nIn propositional logic, the rule of inference that allows us to infer Q \u2192 not P from P \u2192 not Q is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive states that for any conditional statement of the form P \u2192 Q, we can infer not Q \u2192 not P.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have P \u2192 not Q, and we want to infer Q \u2192 not P. This is not the same as the contrapositive. In fact, inferring Q \u2192 not P from P \u2192 not Q is a logical fallacy known as the fallacy of the converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no"
