The given statement is: 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue'.\n   Let's call this statement P \u2192 Q, where:\n   P: The car was red\n   Q: The truck was not blue\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red'.\n   Let's call this statement R \u2192 S, where:\n   R: The truck was blue\n   S: The car was not red\n\n3. We can see that:\n   - Q is the negation of R (Q = not R)\n   - S is the negation of P (S = not P)\n\n4. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a statement P \u2192 Q is (not Q) \u2192 (not P).\n   The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. In this case, the statement we want to infer (R \u2192 S) is the contrapositive of the given statement (P \u2192 Q):\n   - R = not Q\n   - S = not P\n\nTherefore, since the statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement, we can indeed infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
