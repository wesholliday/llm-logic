The given statement is: 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n   Let's define:\n   p: The alien visited Mars\n   q: The robot visited Jupiter\n\n   The given statement can be written as: p \u2192 \u00acq\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'.\n   Using the same variables, this statement can be written as: q \u2192 \u00acp\n\n3. To infer q \u2192 \u00acp from p \u2192 \u00acq, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\n4. The contrapositive of p \u2192 \u00acq is: \u00ac(\u00acq) \u2192 \u00acp\n   Simplifying the double negation, we get: q \u2192 \u00acp\n\n5. The contrapositive (q \u2192 \u00acp) is logically equivalent to the original statement (p \u2192 \u00acq).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' from 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
