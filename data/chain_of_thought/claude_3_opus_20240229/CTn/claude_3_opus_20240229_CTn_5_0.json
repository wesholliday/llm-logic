            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. The original statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' can be represented as:\n   Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy did not play tennis\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball', which can be represented as:\n   Amy played tennis \u2192 Jeff did not play basketball\n\n3. To infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\n5. In this case, the contrapositive of 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' would be:\n   If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\n\n6. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, since the statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the original statement, we can conclude that it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
