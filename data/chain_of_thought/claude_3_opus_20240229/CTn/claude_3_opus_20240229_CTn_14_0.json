It states that a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (~Q \u2192 ~P).\n\n4) Applying this rule, we can see that the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is logically equivalent to the statement we're asked about (~Q \u2192 ~P).\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
