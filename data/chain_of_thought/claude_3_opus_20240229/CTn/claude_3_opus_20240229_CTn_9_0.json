            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". \n   Let's call \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" proposition p, and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" proposition q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: p \u2192 q\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n   Let's call \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" proposition r. Note that r is the negation of q.\n   And \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is the negation of p.\n   So the statement we're trying to infer can be written as: r \u2192 not p\n\n3) In propositional logic, the statement \"p \u2192 q\" is not equivalent to \"not q \u2192 not p\". \n   In other words, the converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4) Therefore, from the original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", \n   we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no"
