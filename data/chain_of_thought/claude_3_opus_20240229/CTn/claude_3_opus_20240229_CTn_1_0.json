The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n5) The contrapositive of statement P would be: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\n6) The contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true.\n\n7) The contrapositive of statement P is exactly the same as statement Q.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer statement Q from statement P.\n\nAnswer: yes"
