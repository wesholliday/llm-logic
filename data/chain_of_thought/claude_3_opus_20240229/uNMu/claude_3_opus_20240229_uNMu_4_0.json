The statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" can be rephrased as \"It is not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars.\"\n\n2. If it's not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars, then there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n3. The phrase \"might not have\" suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\n4. Since there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars (based on the given information), we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can indeed infer that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
