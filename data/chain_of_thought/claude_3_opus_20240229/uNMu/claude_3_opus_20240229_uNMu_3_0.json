In other words, there's a possibility that someone else wrote the book.\n\n3) Now, the question is: Can we infer that the book might not have been written by James?\n\n4) If there's a possibility that someone else wrote the book, then it follows that there's a possibility that James did not write the book.\n\n5) \"Might not\" is equivalent to \"possibly not\". So, if it's possible that James did not write the book, then we can say that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
