The statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" can be rephrased as \"It is not necessarily true that Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\n2. If it's not necessarily true that Lisa bought the red shirt, then there is a possibility that she did not buy the red shirt.\n\n3. The phrase \"might not have\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty.\n\n4. Since there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can infer that \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical reasoning above:\n\nAnswer: yes"
