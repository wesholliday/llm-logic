            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n   - \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the first part is true (Joe went to the park), then the second part must also be true (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that the second part of the conditional (Lucy went to the zoo) is actually false.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional, if the second part (the \"then\" part) is false, what can we say about the first part (the \"if\" part)?\n\n5) In logic, this is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive says that if the \"then\" part of a conditional is false, the \"if\" part must also be false.\n\n6) Applying that here: since \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is false, \"Joe went to the park\" must also be false.\n\n7) In other words, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
