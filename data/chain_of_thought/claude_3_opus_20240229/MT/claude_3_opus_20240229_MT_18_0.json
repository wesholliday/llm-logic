            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The truck was not metal\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the truck was not metal\", which is the opposite of \"the truck was metal\".\n\n4) In logic, when the consequence of a conditional statement is false, we cannot determine whether the condition is true or false. The condition could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether \"the doll was plastic\" or \"the doll was not plastic\". The information given is insufficient to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: no"
