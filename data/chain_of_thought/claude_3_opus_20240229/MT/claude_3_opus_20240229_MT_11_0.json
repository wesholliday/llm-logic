            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n   - \"The muffins were not blueberry\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the cake was chocolate\" is true, then the consequence \"the muffins were blueberry\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the muffins were not blueberry\", which is the opposite of \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"the muffins were blueberry\" is false (because we are told \"the muffins were not blueberry\").\n   - Therefore, the condition \"the cake was chocolate\" must also be false.\n\n6) If \"the cake was chocolate\" is false, then \"the cake was not chocolate\" is true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that \"the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
