It states that if the condition \"the dog was inside\" is true, then the consequence \"the cat was outside\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the cat was not outside\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) In logic, when the consequence of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth of the condition. The condition could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, just because \"the cat was not outside\", we cannot infer that \"the dog was inside\". The dog could have been either inside or outside.\n\nAnswer: no"
