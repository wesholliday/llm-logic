            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". In other words, the consequence of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying this rule to our problem:\n   - The conditional \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is false (because we are told \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\").\n   - Therefore, the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
