            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   - \"Jen did not watch basketball\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"Jen did not watch basketball\", which means the consequence in the first statement is false.\n\n4. In logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\". It states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequent \"Jen watched basketball\" is false, as we are told \"Jen did not watch basketball\".\n   - Therefore, according to modus tollens, the antecedent \"Tom watched football\" must also be false.\n\n6. So, we can indeed infer that \"Tom did not watch football\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
