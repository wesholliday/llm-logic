            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n   - \"The banana was not yellow\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the banana was not yellow\".\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the condition? \n\n5) In logic, this is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Applying this to our statements:\n   - The original conditional: \"If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q)\"\n   - The contrapositive: \"If the banana was not yellow (not Q), then the apple was not red (not P)\"\n\n7) We know from the second statement that \"the banana was not yellow\" is true. \n\n8) Therefore, according to the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that \"the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
