            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\n   - \"Amy did not play tennis\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"Amy did not play tennis\". In other words, the consequence in the first statement is false.\n\n4) Now, in a conditional statement, if the consequence is false, what can we say about the condition? \n\n5) In logic, there is a rule called the contrapositive. It states that a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Applying this rule to our problem, the contrapositive of \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" would be \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\n7) We know from the second statement that \"Amy did not play tennis\" is true. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, \"Jeff did not play basketball\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
