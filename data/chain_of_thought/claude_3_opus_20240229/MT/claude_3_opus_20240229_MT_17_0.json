            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\"\n   - \"Kate did not eat the salad\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the consequence \"Kate ate the salad\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Kate did not eat the salad\", which is the opposite of \"Kate ate the salad\".\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the condition? \n\n5) In logic, this is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Applying this to our problem, the contrapositive of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\n7) We know from the second statement that \"Kate did not eat the salad\" is true. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, \"Ben did not eat pasta\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
