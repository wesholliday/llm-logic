            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\"\n   - \"Chris did not finish the race\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that Chris finishing the race is a necessary condition for Alex finishing the race. In other words, Alex finishing implies Chris finishing.\n\n3) The second statement directly states that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n4) Now, let's consider the possible scenarios for Alex:\n   - If Alex finished the race, then according to the first statement, Chris must have finished the race. But this contradicts the second statement. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n   - If Alex did not finish the race, there is no contradiction. The first statement doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex doesn't finish.\n\n5) Since the scenario where Alex finishes the race leads to a contradiction, the only possible scenario is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
