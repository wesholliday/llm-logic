            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"Sue was not at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding either.\n\n3) The second statement directly tells us that \"Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\n4) Combining these two pieces of information:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have been there too (from statement 1)\n   - But Sue was not at the wedding (from statement 2)\n   - Therefore, Mary could not have been at the wedding either.\n\n5) This is a valid inference. If the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, and the premise \"Sue was not at the wedding\" is also true, then we can logically conclude that \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
