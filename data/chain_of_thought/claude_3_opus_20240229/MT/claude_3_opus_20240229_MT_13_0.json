            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n   - \"The truck was not blue\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the car was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was blue\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"the truck was not blue\".\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the condition? \n\n5) In logic, this is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n6) Applying this to our problem, the contrapositive of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\".\n\n7) We know from the second statement that \"the truck was not blue\" is true. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, \"the car was not red\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
