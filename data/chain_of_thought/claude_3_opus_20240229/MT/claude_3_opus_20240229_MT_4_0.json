It states that if the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" is true, then the consequence \"the robot visited Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is false.\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the condition? \n   - If the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. \n   - Why? Because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true (according to the conditional statement).\n\n5) In this case, the consequence \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is false. Therefore, the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" must also be false.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
