It states that if the bear being in the cave is true, then the wolf being in the den must also be true.\n\n3) However, the second statement tells us that \"the wolf was not in the den\" is true.\n\n4) If the wolf was not in the den, then according to the first statement, it cannot be true that the bear was in the cave. If the bear was in the cave, the wolf would have to be in the den, but we know it wasn't.\n\n5) Therefore, given these two statements, we can indeed infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
