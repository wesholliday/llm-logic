            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n   - \"The pants were not denim\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the consequence \"the pants were denim\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that \"the pants were not denim\". In other words, the consequence in the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\". It states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying this rule to our problem:\n   - The conditional \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"the pants were denim\" is false (because we are told \"the pants were not denim\").\n   - Therefore, by modus tollens, the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
