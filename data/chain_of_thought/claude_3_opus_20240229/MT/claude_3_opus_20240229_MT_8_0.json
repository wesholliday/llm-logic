It states that if the vampire was awake, then it necessarily follows that the mummy was awake. \n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the first statement. It states that the mummy was not awake.\n\n4) If the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false.\n\n5) Therefore, since the mummy was not awake, it follows that the vampire must not have been awake either. If the vampire were awake, the conditional would require the mummy to be awake, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
