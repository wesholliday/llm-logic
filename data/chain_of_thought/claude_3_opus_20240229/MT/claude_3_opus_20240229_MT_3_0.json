            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   - The book is not a mystery novel.\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain consequence follows (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n4) Now, if the condition in the first statement were true (i.e., if the book was written by James), then the consequence would also have to be true (the book would have to be a mystery novel). But we know from the second statement that the consequence is not true.\n\n5) Therefore, the condition in the first statement cannot be true either. In other words, the book could not have been written by James, because if it had been, it would have been a mystery novel, which it is not.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
