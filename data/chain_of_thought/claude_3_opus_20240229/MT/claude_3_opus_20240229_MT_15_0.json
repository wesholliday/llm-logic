            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\"\n   - \"Erin did not take a train\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. It states that \"Erin did not take a train\", which is the opposite of \"Erin took a train\".\n\n4) Now, if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, what can we say about the condition? In logic, this is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n5) Applying the contrapositive to our conditional statement, we get:\n   \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\"\n\n6) We know from the second statement that \"Erin did not take a train\" is true. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, \"Sam did not take a plane\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
