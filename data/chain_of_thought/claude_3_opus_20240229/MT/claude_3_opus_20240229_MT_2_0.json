            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n   - \"The unicorn was not in the forest\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that the unicorn being in the forest is a necessary condition for the griffin being in the forest. In other words, if the griffin was in the forest, it's guaranteed that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\n3) The second statement directly contradicts the necessary condition for the griffin being in the forest. We are told that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4) So, if the unicorn was not in the forest, then it cannot be true that the griffin was in the forest, because the necessary condition for the griffin being in the forest (the unicorn being in the forest) is not met.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
