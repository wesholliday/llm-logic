'The muffins were blueberry' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'the cake was chocolate' is true, then the consequence 'the muffins were blueberry' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about the reverse - if the muffins were blueberry, the cake may or may not have been chocolate.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'the muffins were blueberry' is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry, independent of the cake's flavor.\n\nIn other words, while the given statements are consistent with the cake being chocolate, they do not guarantee or require it to be true. The cake could have been vanilla, strawberry, or any other flavor, and the given statements would still be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' must be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
