'Jen watched basketball' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'Tom watched football' is true, then the consequence 'Jen watched basketball' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about what happens if 'Tom watched football' is false.\n\nThe second statement tells us that 'Jen watched basketball' is true, but it does not give us any information about whether or not Tom watched football.\n\nJust because the consequence 'Jen watched basketball' is true, we cannot conclude that the condition 'Tom watched football' must also be true. Jen could have watched basketball for reasons unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine with certainty whether 'Tom watched football' is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no"
