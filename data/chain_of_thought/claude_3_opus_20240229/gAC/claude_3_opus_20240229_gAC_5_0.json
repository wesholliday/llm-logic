'Amy played tennis' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'Jeff played basketball' is true, then the consequence 'Amy played tennis' must also be true. However, it does not say anything about what happens if 'Jeff played basketball' is false.\n\nThe second statement tells us that 'Amy played tennis' is true, but it does not give us any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nJust because the consequence 'Amy played tennis' is true, we cannot conclude that the condition 'Jeff played basketball' must also be true. Amy could have played tennis for reasons unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nFor example, consider these possibilities:\n- Jeff played basketball, and therefore Amy played tennis (consistent with statement 1).\n- Jeff did not play basketball, but Amy played tennis anyway (consistent with statement 2).\n\nSince both possibilities are consistent with the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Jeff played basketball' is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
