'The robot visited Jupiter' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'the alien visited Mars' is true, then the consequence 'the robot visited Jupiter' must also be true. However, it does not say anything about the truth of the consequence implying the truth of the condition.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the consequence 'the robot visited Jupiter' is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition 'the alien visited Mars' must be true. It's possible that the robot visited Jupiter for reasons unrelated to the alien visiting Mars.\n\nIn other words, while the conditional statement says that the alien visiting Mars is sufficient for the robot visiting Jupiter, it is not necessary. The robot could have visited Jupiter even if the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, given the information provided, we cannot conclude that 'The alien visited Mars' must be true.\n\nAnswer: no"
