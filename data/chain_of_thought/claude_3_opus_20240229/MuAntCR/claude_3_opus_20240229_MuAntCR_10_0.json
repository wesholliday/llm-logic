            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies that the document underwent the process of notarization. Notarization is the official process of authenticating a document, which typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. The signer appears in person before a notary public.\n2. The signer signs the document in the presence of the notary.\n3. The notary verifies the signer's identity and witnesses the signing.\n4. The notary affixes their official seal and signature to the document.\n\nBased on these steps, we can see that for a document to be notarized, it must first be signed by the person executing the document. The notary then witnesses the signing and authenticates the document with their seal and signature. Therefore, if a document has been notarized, it necessarily means that it has also been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
