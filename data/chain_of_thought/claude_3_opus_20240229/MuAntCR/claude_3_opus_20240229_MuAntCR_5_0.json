            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been signed for\" implies that at some point in time, the package was delivered and a signature was obtained to confirm receipt. However, this statement alone does not specify when the delivery and signing took place. It could have happened yesterday, but it could also have occurred any other day before the statement was made.\n\nTo infer that \"The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for,\" we would need additional information or context that specifically points to the package being delivered yesterday. Without such information, we cannot make that inference solely based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
