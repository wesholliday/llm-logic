The location of the bed is not specified in the given statement. It is possible that the bed could be on the ground floor or in a basement, for example. Without additional context about the layout of the house or building, we cannot make the inference that the envelope must have been both upstairs and under a bed based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
