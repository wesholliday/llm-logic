However, this statement alone does not give any information about whether the application was completed online or through some other method. It's possible that the application could have been completed on paper, in person, or through various other means, and still included references as required. The given statement is not sufficient to infer that the application must have been completed online in addition to including references. More information would be needed to draw that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
