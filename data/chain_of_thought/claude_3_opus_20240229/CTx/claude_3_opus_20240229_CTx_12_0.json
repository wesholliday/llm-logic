            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip lupped the zoint\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\"?\n\n3) This is a question of contraposition. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) The contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true. \n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
