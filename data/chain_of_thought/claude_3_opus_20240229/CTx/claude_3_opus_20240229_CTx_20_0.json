In logic, this is equivalent to saying \"bluttered fleeg implies surned fleeg\". \n\n2) What we're asked is whether we can infer the statement \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from the original statement.\n\n3) The statement we're asked about is equivalent to saying \"not surned fleeg implies not bluttered fleeg\".\n\n4) In logic, if a statement P implies a statement Q, then the contrapositive \"not Q implies not P\" is also true.\n\n5) In this case, the original statement \"bluttered fleeg implies surned fleeg\" has the contrapositive \"not surned fleeg implies not bluttered fleeg\".\n\n6) The contrapositive in step 5 is exactly the statement we're asked about in step 3.\n\n7) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from the original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
