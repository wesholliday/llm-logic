In other words, \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\".\n\n3) In general, if a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true. \n\n4) The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, from the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\", we can infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
