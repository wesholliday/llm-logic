            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged\".\n\n2) We are asked whether we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\"?\n\n3) This is a question of logical implication. In general, \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is logically equivalent to \"If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining\".\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\", we can indeed infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
