In other words, can we infer \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of the contrapositive is true. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", and this is always true if the original statement is true.\n\n4) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
