In other words, can we infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement. \n\n4) The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". This is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from the original statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\". The inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
