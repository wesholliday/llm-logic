            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\n2) We are asked whether we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\", i.e., \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\n3) This is a question about the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. That means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, yes, we can infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
