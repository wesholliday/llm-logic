            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\"?\n\n3) This is a question of logical implication. In propositional logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) Therefore, from the statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\", we can indeed infer \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
