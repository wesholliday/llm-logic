In other words, \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of a statement is necessarily true. The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".\n\n4) However, the statement we're asked about is not the converse. It's the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n5) A statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. If a statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, from \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\", we can infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
