            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed\".\n\n2) We are asked whether we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from this. In other words, can we infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\"?\n\n3) This is a question about the contrapositive of a statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
