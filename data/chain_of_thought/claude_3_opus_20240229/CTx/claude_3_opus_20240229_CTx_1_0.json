In other words, can we infer \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of a conditional statement is always true. The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".\n\n4) However, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot automatically infer the converse of a conditional statement.\n\n6) In this case, we cannot infer \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" from \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\".\n\nAnswer: no"
