            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened\".\n\n2) We are asked if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P\" from this original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of a conditional statement is always true. The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".\n\n4) However, the converse of a statement is not always true. For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n5) Similarly, in this case, just because we know that \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\", we can't necessarily conclude that \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\". There could be other reasons why the dreb was not spened, even if it was vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
