In other words, can we infer \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4) The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". This is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5) The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\". This is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6) However, in this case, we are asked about the converse of the contrapositive, not the converse of the original statement.\n\n7) Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the converse of the contrapositive is the same as the contrapositive, the converse of the contrapositive is also logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
