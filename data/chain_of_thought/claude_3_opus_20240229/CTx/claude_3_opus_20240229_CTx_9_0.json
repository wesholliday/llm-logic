            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it was varnished\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\"?\n\n3) This is a question of logical implication. In general, a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) Therefore, the statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" is indeed a valid inference from the original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
