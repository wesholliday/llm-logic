In other words, can we infer \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\"?\n\n3) This is a question of logical implication. In general, if a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\n4) Therefore, from the statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\", we can indeed infer \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
