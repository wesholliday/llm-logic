            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\"?\n\n3) This is a question of contraposition. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, yes, we can infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
