We are also told \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\". This is an either/or statement - one of these two things must be true. Either the smonk is definitely plagged, or it is vreebled.\n\n3. From statement 1, we know the smonk is not definitely plagged, since it only \"might not be\". \n\n4. Therefore, for the either/or statement in 2 to be true, the other option must hold - the smonk must be vreebled.\n\n5. So yes, from these two statements we can logically infer that the smonk is vreebled. If it's not definitely plagged, then it must be vreebled for the either/or to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
