This means there is a possibility the flugel is not zargled. \n\n2) We are also told \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\". This is an either/or statement - one of these two things must be true. Either the flugel is zargled, or the flugel is blimmed.\n\n3) Now, from the first statement, we know the flugel might not be zargled. If the flugel is not zargled, then according to the second statement, it must be blimmed. \n\n4) However, the first statement doesn't say the flugel is definitely not zargled, only that it might not be. So we can't say for certain that the flugel is blimmed.\n\n5) The flugel could still be zargled, in which case we don't know if it's also blimmed or not. The statements don't give us enough information to conclude either way.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flugel is blimmed. It might be, but it also might not be.\n\nAnswer: no"
