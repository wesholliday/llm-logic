In other words, it's possible that the flug is not zimmed.\n\n2) The second statement says that either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed. This means there are only two possibilities - the flug is zimmed, or the flug is blummed. \n\n3) Now, from the first statement, we know it's possible the flug is not zimmed. If that's the case, then according to the second statement, the flug must be blummed.\n\n4) However, the first statement doesn't definitively say the flug is not zimmed, only that it might not be. So while we can infer that if the flug is not zimmed, it must be blummed, we can't say for certain that it is blummed.\n\nAnswer: no"
