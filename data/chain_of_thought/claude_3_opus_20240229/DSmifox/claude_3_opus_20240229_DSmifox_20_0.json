In other words, the fleeg being surned is not certain.\n\n3) The second statement gives us a disjunction (an \"either-or\" statement). It says that one of two things must be true: either the fleeg must be surned, or the fleeg is bluttered.\n\n4) Now, from the first statement, we know that the fleeg might not be surned. This means that the first part of the disjunction in the second statement (\"the fleeg must be surned\") is not necessarily true.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one part is not true, then the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"the fleeg must be surned\" is not true, then \"the fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\n7) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
