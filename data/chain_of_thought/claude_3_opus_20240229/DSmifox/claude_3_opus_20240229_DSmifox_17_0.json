But it doesn't definitively say the flob is not movated.\n\n2. We are also told \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\". This is an either/or statement. It says the flob is definitely in one of two states - either movated or skizzled. It can't be neither, and it can't be both.\n\n3. Now, if we knew for certain that the flob was not movated, then from statement 2 we could indeed infer that the flob must be skizzled. \n\n4. However, statement 1 does not say definitively that the flob is not movated. It only says it might not be. There is still a possibility that it is movated.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that the flob is skizzled. It could be skizzled, but it could also be movated. We don't have enough definitive information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
