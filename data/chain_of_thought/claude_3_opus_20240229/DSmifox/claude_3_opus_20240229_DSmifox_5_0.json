We are also told \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\". This is an either/or statement - one of these two things must be true. Either the zinger is smoogled, or the zinger is fraggled.\n\n3. Now, from statement 1, we know the zinger might not be smoogled. If the zinger is not smoogled, then according to statement 2, it must be fraggled. \n\n4. However, statement 1 only says the zinger MIGHT not be smoogled. There is still a possibility that it IS smoogled. In that case, we can't say for certain that it is fraggled.\n\n5. So while the statements allow for the possibility that the zinger is fraggled, they do not guarantee or prove that the zinger must be fraggled. We cannot logically infer that with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
