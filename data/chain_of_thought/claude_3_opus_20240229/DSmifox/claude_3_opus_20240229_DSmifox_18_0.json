We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The shank might not be nugged\"\n   b) \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked\"\n\n2. Statement (a) suggests that it's possible the shank is not nugged, but doesn't say for certain. \n\n3. Statement (b) presents two possibilities: either the shank must be nugged, or the shank is plooked. It has to be one or the other.\n\n4. If we assume statement (a) is true and the shank is indeed not nugged, then looking at statement (b), the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\n5. Therefore, if both given statements are true, and we assume the shank is not nugged based on statement (a), then we can logically infer that the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
