In other words, it's possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n2) The second statement gives us a disjunction (an either/or): either the whiffle must be tinked, or it is shanked. \n\n3) Now, if we assume that the whiffle is not tinked (which is possible according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be shanked.\n\n4) So, if the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked.\n\n5) However, the first statement doesn't say that the whiffle is definitely not tinked, only that it might not be. So we can't say for certain that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n6) In other words, the whiffle being shanked is a possibility given these statements, but not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
