In other words, it's possible that the glip is not tragged.\n\n2) The second statement says that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This means there are only two possibilities - the glip is tragged, or the glip is slogged.\n\n3) Now, if we combine the information from the two statements:\n   - From (1), we know the glip might not be tragged. \n   - From (2), we know that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\n4) Therefore, if the possibility in (1) is true, i.e., if the glip is indeed not tragged, then from (2) we can infer that the glip must be slogged.\n\n5) However, (1) only says that the glip MIGHT not be tragged. It doesn't say for certain that the glip is not tragged. There's still a possibility that the glip is tragged.\n\n6) So while the statements allow for the possibility that the glip is slogged, they don't prove conclusively that the glip is slogged. The glip could still be tragged.\n\nAnswer: no"
