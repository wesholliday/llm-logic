            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement tells us that the fribble being crinked is not certain - it might be crinked, or it might not be. \n\n2) The second statement gives us two possibilities that must be true - either the fribble must be crinked, or it is snurgled. These are the only two options according to this statement.\n\n3) Now, if we put the two statements together, the first one rules out the possibility that the fribble must be crinked. If it might not be crinked, then it cannot be the case that it must be crinked.\n\n4) That leaves us with only one possibility from the second statement - the fribble is snurgled. \n\n5) Since the fribble might not be crinked, and the only other option is that it is snurgled, we can logically infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nTherefore, from the two given statements, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
