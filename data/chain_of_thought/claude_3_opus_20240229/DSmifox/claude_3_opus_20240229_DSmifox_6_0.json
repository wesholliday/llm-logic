We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The grommet might not be plopped\"\n   b) \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\"\n\n2. Statement (a) suggests that it's possible the grommet is not plopped. In other words, the grommet being plopped is not certain.\n\n3. Statement (b) presents an either/or situation - the grommet is either definitely plopped, or it is sploffed. There are no other possibilities given.\n\n4. Now, if we consider both statements together:\n   - From (a), we know the grommet might not be plopped.\n   - But if the grommet is not plopped, then according to (b), it must be sploffed, because those are the only two possibilities.\n\n5. Therefore, the combination of the two statements leads us to the conclusion that the grommet is indeed sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
