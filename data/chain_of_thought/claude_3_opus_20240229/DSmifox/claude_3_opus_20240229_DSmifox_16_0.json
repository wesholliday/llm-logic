But it doesn't definitively say whether the sneg is sproted or not.\n\n2) The second statement is \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\". This is an either/or statement. It means that one of these two things must be true: either the sneg is definitely sproted, or it is definitely crampled. \n\n3) Now, if we combine these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n   - From statement 2, we know the sneg is either sproted or crampled. \n   - But statement 1 says the sneg might not be sproted. \n   - So if the sneg is not sproted, then according to statement 2, it must be crampled.\n\n4) Therefore, from these two statements together, we can infer that the sneg is crampled. If it's not sproted (which is possible according to statement 1), then it must be crampled (according to statement 2).\n\nAnswer: yes"
