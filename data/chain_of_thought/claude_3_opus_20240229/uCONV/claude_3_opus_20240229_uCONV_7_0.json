This does not contradict statement (1), because statement (1) only tells us what happens if Alex finishes the race. It doesn't tell us what happens if Alex doesn't finish the race.\n\n5) In other words, it's possible that Chris could finish the race even if Alex doesn't, and this would not contradict the given information.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer statement (2) from statement (1).\n\nAnswer: no"
