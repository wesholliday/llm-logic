The given statement does not imply the converse.\n\nConsider a counterexample:\nIf the mummy was awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The mummy could have been awake while the vampire was still asleep.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
