The given statement can be represented as: \n   James wrote the book (p) \u2192 the book is a mystery novel (q)\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is:\n   The book is a mystery novel (q) \u2192 James wrote the book (p)\n\n3. The statement we want to infer is the converse of the given statement. \n\n4. In general, the truth of a statement does not imply the truth of its converse. For example:\n   \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet due to other reasons).\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
