Statement (1) would still be true in this case.\n\n5) For example, consider a scenario where Sue was at the wedding but Mary wasn't. This doesn't contradict statement (1), because statement (1) only talks about what happens if Mary was at the wedding. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary wasn't at the wedding.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer statement (2) from statement (1). The presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary.\n\nAnswer: no"
