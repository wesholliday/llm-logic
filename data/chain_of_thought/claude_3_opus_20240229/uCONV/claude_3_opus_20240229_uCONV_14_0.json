For example, the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true because the ground could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler or a recent flood.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the fact that the wolf was in the den does not necessarily imply that the bear was in the cave. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons, even if the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
