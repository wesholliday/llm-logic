In other words, P \u2192 Q does not necessarily imply Q \u2192 P.\n\nFor example:\nIf it is raining, then the ground is wet. (True)\nIf the ground is wet, then it is raining. (Not necessarily true, as the ground could be wet due to other reasons)\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" from the given statement \"if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\".\n\nAnswer: no"
