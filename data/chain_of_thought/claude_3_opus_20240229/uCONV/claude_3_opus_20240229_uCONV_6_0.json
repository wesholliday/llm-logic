They are called converse statements, and they are not logically equivalent.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThe converse would be: \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\" (Q \u2192 P)\nHowever, the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a spilled drink, so the converse is not necessarily true.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, just because Bob choosing pasta implies that Sue chose pizza, it doesn't necessarily mean that Sue choosing pizza is the only reason for Bob to choose pasta. There could be other factors influencing Bob's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
