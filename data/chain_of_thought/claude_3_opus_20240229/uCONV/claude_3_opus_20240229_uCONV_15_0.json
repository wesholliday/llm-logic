However, the converse of a statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThe converse would be: \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\" (Q \u2192 P)\nHowever, the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like someone watering their lawn, so the converse is not necessarily true.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, just because we know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", it doesn't necessarily mean that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\". Erin could have taken a train for reasons unrelated to Sam's travel plans.\n\nAnswer: no"
