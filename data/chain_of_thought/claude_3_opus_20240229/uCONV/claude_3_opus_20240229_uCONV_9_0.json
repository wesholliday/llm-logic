However, the converse of a statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nConsider this example:\nIf it is raining, then the ground is wet. (True)\nIf the ground is wet, then it is raining. (Not necessarily true, as the ground could be wet due to other reasons)\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no"
