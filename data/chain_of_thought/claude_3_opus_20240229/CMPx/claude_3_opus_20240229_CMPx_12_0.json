    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three applicants for renting a bondle: a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp.\n\n2. The owner ranks the applicants in this order of preference: stribben > vanoon > jentapp. \n\n3. We are told that if the vanoon isn't selected, then if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected. In other words, if both the stribben and vanoon are not selected, the jentapp will be selected by default as the only remaining applicant.\n\n4. We are also told that the stribben is likely to be chosen, which implies the vanoon is likely not to be chosen.\n\n5. The question is asking: if the stribben isn't selected, is the jentapp likely to be selected?\n\n6. If the stribben isn't selected, that leaves the vanoon and jentapp. We know the owner prefers the vanoon over the jentapp.\n\n7. Even though the stribben is likely to be selected, if for some reason it isn't, the vanoon would be next in line, not the jentapp. \n\n8. The statement \"if the vanoon isn't selected, then if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected\" doesn't imply that if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp is likely to be selected. It just states what would happen if both the vanoon and stribben are not selected.\n\n9. Therefore, it does not follow that it's likely that if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected. If the stribben isn't selected, the vanoon is more likely to be selected than the jentapp.\n\nAnswer: no"
