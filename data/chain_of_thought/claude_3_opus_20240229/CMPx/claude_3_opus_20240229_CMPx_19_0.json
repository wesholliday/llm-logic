    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three candidates for domer of the year: a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk.\n\n2. The garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance.\n\n3. If the beelhet doesn't become domer, then if the garplex also doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer (since these are the only candidates).\n\n4. It is likely the garplex will become domer, which means it's likely the beelhet won't become domer.\n\n5. The question is: Does it follow that it's likely that, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will?\n\n6. While it's true that if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will (given the beelhet doesn't), this doesn't mean it's *likely* the peedonk will become domer if the garplex doesn't.\n\n7. The likelihood of the peedonk becoming domer if the garplex doesn't depends on the original probabilities. If the garplex is much more likely to win than the beelhet and peedonk combined, then even if the garplex doesn't win, the beelhet is still more likely to win than the peedonk.\n\n8. The problem states the garplex is likely to win, but it doesn't give enough information to determine if the peedonk is likely to win if the garplex doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
