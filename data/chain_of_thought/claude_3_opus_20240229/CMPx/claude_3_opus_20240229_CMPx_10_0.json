    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're told that the fantole, dribban, and cruggit are the top downloaded fillip apps this month, in that order.\n\n2. Market watchers expect the fantole to retain the top spot, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit significantly lower. \n\n3. We're also told that if the dribban isn't the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn't, the cruggit will be. \n\n4. Additionally, since the fantole likely will lead downloads, it's likely the dribban won't be the most downloaded.\n\n5. The question is asking: Given this information, is it likely that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?\n\n6. From points 1 and 2, the most likely scenario is: fantole 1st, dribban 2nd, cruggit 3rd. \n\n7. Point 4 tells us the dribban likely won't be 1st. If the fantole also isn't 1st (unlikely but possible), then point 3 says the cruggit would be 1st in that case.\n\n8. So if the fantole isn't 1st (which is unlikely), the cruggit likely would be, because the dribban also likely won't be 1st.\n\nTherefore, yes, it is likely that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
