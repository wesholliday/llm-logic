    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three players - a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen - who are the top prospects to have a breakout season next year.\n\n2. The likelihood of each having a breakout season, from most likely to least likely, is: flinker, dringen, n\u00fcffen. \n\n3. We're told that if the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\n4. The scouts also think the flinker will likely have a breakout season, and hence the dringen likely won't. \n\n5. The question is asking: given this information, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, is it likely the n\u00fcffen will?\n\n6. If the flinker is likely to have a breakout season, that means the dringen likely won't (based on what the scouts think).\n\n7. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker also doesn't, the n\u00fcffen will (based on the given condition).\n\n8. So if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, we're already in a scenario where the dringen likely hasn't had one either.\n\n9. In this scenario, based on the given condition, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\n10. Therefore, yes, it is likely that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
