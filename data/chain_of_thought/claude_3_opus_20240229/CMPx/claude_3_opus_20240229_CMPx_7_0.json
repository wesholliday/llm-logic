    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are told that the crastin, nivet, and jomial are the top bispets for breeding this season.\n\n2. The breeders expect the crastin to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, and then the jomial with many fewer.\n\n3. It's given that if the nivet doesn't birth the most, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will. This can be logically stated as: \n   If not Nivet, then (if not Crastin, then Jomial)\n\n4. We are also told that the crastin likely will lead births, and hence the nivet likely won't. In other words:\n   If Crastin, then likely not Nivet\n\n5. The question is asking: If the crastin doesn't lead births, is it likely that the jomial will?\n\n6. From (3), we know that if the crastin doesn't lead, the jomial will lead only if the nivet also doesn't lead.\n\n7. However, from (4), we know that if the crastin doesn't lead, it's likely that the nivet will lead.\n\n8. Therefore, if the crastin doesn't lead, it's not likely that the jomial will lead, because the nivet probably will.\n\nAnswer: no"
