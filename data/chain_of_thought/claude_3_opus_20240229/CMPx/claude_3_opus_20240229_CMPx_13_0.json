    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three contenders for Blither of the Year: a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon.\n\n2. The fantug is considered the front runner, the loperit is second, and the frallon is a heavy underdog. \n\n3. We are told that if the loperit doesn't win, then if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon will win. This makes sense because they are the only contenders.\n\n4. We are also told that the fantug likely will win, and hence the loperit likely won't win.\n\n5. The question is asking: Given that the fantug is likely to win, is it likely that if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon will win?\n\n6. If the fantug doesn't win, there are two possibilities: either the loperit wins, or the frallon wins. \n\n7. However, we are told that the loperit likely won't win. So if the fantug doesn't win, it's likely that the frallon will win.\n\nTherefore, yes, it is likely that if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will win.\n\nAnswer: yes"
