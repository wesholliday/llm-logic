The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are told that the fraglen, darpil, and votal are the top bispil teams this season, in that order of expected performance. \n\n2. It's given that if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will. In other words, if neither the fraglen nor darpil lead the league, the votal must.\n\n3. We're also told that the fraglen likely will lead the league, and hence the darpil likely won't. \n\n4. The question is asking: Given this information, is it likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will?\n\n5. If the fraglen doesn't lead the league, there are two possibilities:\n   a) The darpil leads the league\n   b) The votal leads the league\n\n6. We know the fraglen is likely to lead. So if it doesn't, that's an unlikely scenario to begin with.\n\n7. In that unlikely scenario, we're told that if the darpil also doesn't lead, the votal must. But the darpil leading is also unlikely (because the fraglen likely will).\n\n8. So in the unlikely event that the fraglen doesn't lead, it's likely the darpil would, not the votal. The votal leading is contingent on both the fraglen and darpil not leading, which is an even more unlikely scenario.\n\nTherefore, no, it does not follow that it's likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will. If the fraglen doesn't lead, the darpil likely would, not the votal.\n\nAnswer: no"
