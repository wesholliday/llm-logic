    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are told that the jentil, lomfry, and darsal are the leading gardam suppliers.\n\n2. Analysts expect the jentil to sell the most, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal selling significantly less.\n\n3. These three dominate the gardam market. So if the lomfry doesn't sell the most, then either the jentil or the darsal will.\n\n4. We are also told that if the jentil doesn't sell the most, the darsal will. This is because the lomfry likely won't sell the most (since the jentil likely will).\n\n5. The question is asking: If the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, is it likely that the darsal will?\n\n6. Based on the information given, if the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will. This is directly stated in the passage.\n\n7. The word \"likely\" in the question refers back to the likelihood of the jentil leading gardam sales. But the conclusion about the darsal leading if the jentil doesn't is presented as a certainty, not just a likelihood.\n\nTherefore, yes, it does follow that if the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will (not just likely, but certainly).\n\nAnswer: yes"
