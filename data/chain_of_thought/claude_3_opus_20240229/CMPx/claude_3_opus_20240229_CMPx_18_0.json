    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We have three major bafwidgers: a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil. These are the only major bafwidgers.\n\n2. Experts expect the blimfet will likely bafwidge the most, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. \n\n3. If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet also doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most (since these are the only major bafwidgers).\n\n4. The blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most, which means the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most.\n\n5. The question is asking: if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, is it likely that the narzil will?\n\n6. From points 2 and 4, the blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most. So the scenario of the blimfet not bafwidging the most is unlikely to begin with.\n\n7. However, if that unlikely scenario does occur, and the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then point 3 tells us the narzil will bafwidge the most (since the crongle also likely won't bafwidge the most).\n\nTherefore, while the scenario itself is unlikely, if it does occur that the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then yes, the narzil likely will bafwidge the most in that case.\n\nAnswer: yes"
