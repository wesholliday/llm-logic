    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three applicants for one open zulision: a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect.\n\n2. The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect.\n\n3. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then either the jantiz or the sulect will get it.\n\n4. It's stated that the jantiz is likely to get the zulision.\n\n5. Consequently, the cramen is likely to not get the zulision.\n\n6. The question is asking: If the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, is it likely that the sulect will get it?\n\n7. If the jantiz doesn't get it, there are only two possibilities: either the cramen gets it or the sulect gets it.\n\n8. We know the cramen is more qualified than the sulect.\n\n9. So if the jantiz doesn't get it, it's more likely that the cramen would get it over the sulect, based on their qualifications.\n\n10. Therefore, even if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, it's not necessarily likely that the sulect will get it. The cramen is still more likely to get it than the sulect in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: no"
