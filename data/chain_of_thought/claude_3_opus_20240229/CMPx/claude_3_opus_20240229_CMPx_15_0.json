    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're told the fantole is the most likely to win the Rizzle Cup, followed by the dribban, and the snorpul is a heavy longshot.\n\n2. We're also told that if the dribban doesn't win, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win. This makes sense because these are the only top contenders.\n\n3. The question also states that the fantole likely will win the cup, and hence the dribban likely won't win. \n\n4. Now, the question is asking: Given that the fantole is likely to win, does it follow that if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul likely will?\n\n5. If the fantole doesn't win, there are two possibilities: either the dribban wins, or the snorpul wins. \n\n6. But we're told the dribban likely won't win. So if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul is the more likely alternative, even though it's a heavy longshot overall.\n\n7. Therefore, it does follow that if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul likely will, relative to the dribban.\n\nAnswer: yes"
