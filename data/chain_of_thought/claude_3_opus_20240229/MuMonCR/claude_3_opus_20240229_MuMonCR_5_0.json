            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The package must have been delivered today\n2. The package must have been signed for\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. This is known as the \"elimination rule\" for conjunction.\n\nTherefore, if we accept the original statement as true, we can infer that each part of the statement is also true independently. In this case, we can infer \"The package must have been signed for\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
