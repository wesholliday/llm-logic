            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The car must have been in the garage.\n2. The car needed repairs.\n\nThe use of \"and\" implies that both parts of the statement are true. In logic, when a compound statement with \"and\" is true, it means that each individual part of the statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, if we know that \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs\" is true, we can infer that each part of the statement, including \"The car must have needed repairs,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
