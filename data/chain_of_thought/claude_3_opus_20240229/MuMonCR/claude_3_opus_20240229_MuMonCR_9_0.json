The flight must have been delayed\n2. The flight must have been rerouted\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and\", both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. This means that if the original statement is true, then both parts must also be true individually.\n\nTherefore, if \"The flight must have been delayed and rerouted\" is true, then \"The flight must have been rerouted\" must also be true, as it is one of the two parts that make up the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
