            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The concert must have been sold out.\n2. The concert started at 8 PM.\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. This means that if the original statement is true, then both parts must be true independently.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\" from the original statement because it is one of the two parts that are connected by \"and.\" If the original statement is true, then this part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
