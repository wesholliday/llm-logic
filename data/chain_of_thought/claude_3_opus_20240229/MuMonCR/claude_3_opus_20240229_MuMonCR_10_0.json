            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" contains two requirements joined by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The document must have been signed.\n2. The document must have been notarized.\n\nIn propositional logic, when a statement P and a statement Q are joined by \"and\" (P \u2227 Q), both P and Q must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if we know that \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is true, we can infer that each individual part of the statement is also true.\n\nSo, if \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is true, then \"The document must have been notarized\" must also be true, as it is one of the necessary conditions specified in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
