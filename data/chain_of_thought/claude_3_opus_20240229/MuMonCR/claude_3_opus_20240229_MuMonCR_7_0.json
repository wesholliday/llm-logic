            "content": "Explanation: The given statement, \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The exam must have been difficult.\n2. The exam must have covered all chapters.\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by the conjunction \"and,\" both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the given statement is true, then both parts of the statement must also be true independently.\n\nThe second part of the statement, \"The exam must have covered all chapters,\" is exactly what we are asked to infer. Since this is already a part of the given statement, and the conjunction \"and\" ensures that both parts are true, we can indeed infer that \"The exam must have covered all chapters\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
