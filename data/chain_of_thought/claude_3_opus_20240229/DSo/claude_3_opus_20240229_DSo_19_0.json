It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the watch is charging on the dresser, or it is on his wrist.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n4) If one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other possibility must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, and we know that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist, then it must be true that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n6) So, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
