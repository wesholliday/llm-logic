In other words, the sunglasses must be either in her bag or on her head.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the sunglasses are not on her head. This eliminates one of the two possibilities from the second statement.\n\n4) Since we know the sunglasses are not on her head, and we know they must be either in her bag or on her head, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag.\n\n5) Therefore, we can indeed infer from these two statements that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
