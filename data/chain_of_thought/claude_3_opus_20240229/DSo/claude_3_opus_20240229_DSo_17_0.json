It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the scarf is in the backpack, or it's on the coat rack.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities (the scarf being on the coat rack) is not true.\n\n4) If one part of an \"either-or\" statement is false, then the other part must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the scarf is not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack, assuming the initial statements are true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
