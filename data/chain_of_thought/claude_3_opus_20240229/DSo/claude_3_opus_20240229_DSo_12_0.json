It says the jacket must be in one of two places: either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n4) If the jacket is not hanging in the closet, and it must be either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, then the only remaining possibility is that it is draped over the chair.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
