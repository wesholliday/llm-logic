These are presented as the only two possibilities.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the book is not resting on the table.\n\n4) If one of the two possibilities is not true, and these are the only two possibilities, then the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the book is not resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nSo, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
