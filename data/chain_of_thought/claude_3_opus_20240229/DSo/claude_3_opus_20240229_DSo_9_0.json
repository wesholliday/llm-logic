In other words, it is false that the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\n\n3) The second statement presents an either/or situation: the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or it is blending in on the floor. This means that at least one of these two options must be true, and they cannot both be false.\n\n4) Now, from the first statement, we know that \"the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor\" is false.\n\n5) Therefore, for the second statement to be true, the other option, \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\", must be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
