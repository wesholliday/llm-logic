It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the shoes are in the closet, or they are lined up by the door.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true: the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n4) If one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other one must be true. Otherwise, the disjunction would be false, but we are told that it is true.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the shoes are lined up by the door\" is false, \"the shoes are in the closet\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
