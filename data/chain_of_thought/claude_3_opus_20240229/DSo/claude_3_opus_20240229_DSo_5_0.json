It says that one of two things must be true: either the cookies are in the jar, or they are hidden in the pantry.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the second part of the disjunction is false: the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the cookies are hidden in the pantry\" is false, \"the cookies are in the jar\" must be true, assuming the original disjunction is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
