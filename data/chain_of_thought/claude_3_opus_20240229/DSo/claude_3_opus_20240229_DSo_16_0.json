These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) The first statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n4) If the pen is not on the desk, and the only other possibility presented is that it is in the bag, then we can infer that the pen must be in the bag.\n\n5) The two statements together logically lead to the conclusion that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
