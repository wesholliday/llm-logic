There are no other options given.\n\n4) Since we know from the first statement that the newspaper is not on the porch, and the second statement says it must be either in the driveway or on the porch, we can conclude that it must be in the driveway.\n\n5) If it's not on the porch (which we know it's not), and it's either on the porch or in the driveway (which are the only two options given), then it must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
