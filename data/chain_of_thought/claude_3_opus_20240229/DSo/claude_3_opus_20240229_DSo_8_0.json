It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the remote is on the coffee table, or it's under the couch.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities (the remote being under the couch) is not true.\n\n4) If one of the two possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other one must be true. Otherwise, the disjunction would be false, but we are told that it is true.\n\n5) Therefore, since the remote is not under the couch, and since one of the two locations must be true, it follows that the remote must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
