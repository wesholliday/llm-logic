It says the toy is in one of two possible locations: either in the toy box or on the shelf.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of these possibilities is not true. The toy is not on the shelf.\n\n4) If the toy is not on the shelf, and it must be either in the toy box or on the shelf, then the only remaining possibility is that it is in the toy box.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
