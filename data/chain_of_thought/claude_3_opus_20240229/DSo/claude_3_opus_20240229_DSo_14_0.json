It says the milk must be in one of two possible states: either on the counter or chilling in the fridge.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that one of those possibilities - the milk chilling in the fridge - is not true.\n\n4) If the milk must be either on the counter or in the fridge (from statement 2), and we know it's not in the fridge (from statement 1), then the only remaining possibility is that it's on the counter.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, from these two statements we can infer that the milk is on the counter. If it's not in the fridge, and it must be either in the fridge or on the counter, then it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
