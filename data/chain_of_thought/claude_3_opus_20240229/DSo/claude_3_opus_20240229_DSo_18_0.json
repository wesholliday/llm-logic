We are given two statements:\n   - \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\"\n   - \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\"\n\n2. The second statement presents an either/or situation: the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. There are no other possibilities mentioned.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that the notebook isn't on the nightstand. This eliminates one of the two possibilities from the second statement.\n\n4. Since we have eliminated the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand, and the second statement says it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand, we can conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
