And if they were in fact denim, then the shirt could have been cotton, contrary to the conclusion.\n\n8) In other words, the possibility of the pants not being denim doesn't rule out the shirt being cotton.\n\n9) Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. The premises can be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: no"
