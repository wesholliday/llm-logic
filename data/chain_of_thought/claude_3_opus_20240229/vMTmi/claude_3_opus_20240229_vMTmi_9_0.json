The structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n5) Denying the consequent is a valid form of argument. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n6) However, in this case, the second premise is not \"Not Q\" but \"Possibly not Q\". \n\n7) \"Possibly not Q\" is not the same as \"Not Q\". \"Possibly not Q\" means Q might be false, but it could also be true. It's not a definitive statement.\n\n8) Therefore, the argument is not valid. The conclusion \"Not P\" does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
