The valid form of denying the consequent is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n5) However, the second premise in the given argument is \"Possibly not Q\" or \"The book might not be a mystery novel\", which is not the same as \"Not Q\" or \"The book is not a mystery novel\".\n\n6) \"Possibly not Q\" does not necessarily imply \"Not Q\". For example, it's possible that I don't have a dollar in my pocket, but that doesn't mean I definitely don't have a dollar in my pocket.\n\n7) Therefore, the argument is not valid. The second premise needs to be a definite statement, not a possibility, for the argument to be logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
