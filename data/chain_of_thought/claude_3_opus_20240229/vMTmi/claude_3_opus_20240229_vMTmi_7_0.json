This is equivalent to saying \"P implies Q\".\n\n3) Premise 2 states that Chris might not have finished the race. In other words, it's possible that Q is false.\n\n4) The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race (not P).\n\n5) For the argument to be valid, the truth of the premises must guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n6) However, just because Q might be false (Premise 2), it doesn't necessarily mean that P is false. P could be true while Q is false, which would make Premise 1 false but would not affect the truth of the conclusion.\n\n7) In other words, the possibility of Q being false does not rule out the possibility of P being true. Therefore, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n8) This means that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
