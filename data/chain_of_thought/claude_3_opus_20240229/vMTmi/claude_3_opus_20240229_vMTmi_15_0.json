This introduces an element of uncertainty.\n\n4) The presence of 'might' or 'possibly' in the second premise means that we are not certain about the truth of '\u00acQ'. We are only saying it's a possibility, not a certainty.\n\n5) For Modus Tollens to work and for the argument to be valid, we need to be certain about the truth of '\u00acQ'. The possibility of '\u00acQ' is not enough to conclude '\u00acP' with certainty.\n\n6) Therefore, the given form of argument with 'might' or 'possibly' in the second premise is not logically valid. We cannot draw the conclusion with certainty based on the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
