It states that Bob choosing pasta is dependent on Sue choosing pizza. In other words, if Sue did not choose pizza, then we cannot infer anything about whether or not Bob chose pasta based on this statement alone.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that Sue did not choose pizza. \n\n4) However, this information does not allow us to conclude anything definite about Bob's choice. Bob could have chosen pasta or not, independent of Sue's choice, given the information we have.\n\n5) Therefore, we do not have enough information to infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"
