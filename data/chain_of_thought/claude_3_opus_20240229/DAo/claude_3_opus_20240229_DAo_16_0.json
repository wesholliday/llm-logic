            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The shirt was not cotton\"\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the conclusion \"the pants were denim\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the first statement tells us that \"the shirt was not cotton\". This means that the condition in the second statement is not met.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the conclusion (the \"then\" part). The conclusion could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, just because the shirt was not cotton, we cannot conclude anything about whether the pants were denim or not. The pants could have been denim, or they could have been some other material.\n\n6) We do not have enough information to infer that \"the pants were not denim\".\n\nAnswer: no"
