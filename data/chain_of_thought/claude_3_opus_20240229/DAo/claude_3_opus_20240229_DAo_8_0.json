            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given the statement \"The vampire was not awake\". Let's call this statement P.\n\n2) We are also given the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". This can be rephrased as \"If P, then Q\", where Q represents the statement \"The mummy was awake\".\n\n3) Now, we want to determine if we can infer the statement \"The mummy was not awake\" from these two pieces of information. Let's call this statement not-Q.\n\n4) In logic, the structure we have here is called modus tollens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", and we also know \"not Q\", then we can infer \"not P\".\n\n5) However, that's not the structure we have here. We know \"not P\" (the vampire was not awake), and we're trying to infer \"not Q\" (the mummy was not awake).\n\n6) The conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not allow us to infer anything about Q when we know \"not P\". Q could be either true or false.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot logically infer the statement \"The mummy was not awake\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
