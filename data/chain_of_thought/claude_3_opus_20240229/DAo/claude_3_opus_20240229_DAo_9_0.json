            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we are told in the first statement that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". This means the condition in the second statement is not met.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the consequence. The consequence could be either true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether or not Mark bought the blue shirt. He may have bought it for reasons unrelated to Lisa's purchase, or he may not have bought it at all.\n\n6) Since we cannot definitively say \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", the answer to the question is no.\n\nAnswer: no"
