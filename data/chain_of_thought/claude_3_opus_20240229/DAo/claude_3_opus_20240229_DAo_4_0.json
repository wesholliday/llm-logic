It states that the robot visiting Jupiter is dependent on the alien visiting Mars. In other words, the only way for the robot to have visited Jupiter is if the alien visited Mars.\n\n3) However, the first statement clearly says that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n4) So, the condition for the robot visiting Jupiter (the alien visiting Mars) was not met.\n\n5) Therefore, we can conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
