            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The griffin was not in the forest\"\n   - \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that the unicorn being in the forest is dependent on the griffin being in the forest.\n\n3) However, the first statement tells us that the griffin was not in the forest. \n\n4) So, the condition in the second statement (the griffin being in the forest) is not met.\n\n5) When the condition in a conditional statement is not met, we cannot make any conclusion about the consequence (the unicorn being in the forest).\n\n6) Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we do not have enough information to conclude whether the unicorn was or was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no"
