            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The apple was not red\"\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"the apple was not red\". In other words, the condition in the second statement is not met.\n\n4) In logic, when the condition (antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is automatically true, regardless of whether the consequence (consequent) is true or false.\n\n5) Therefore, the second statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about the actual color of the banana.\n\n6) The color of the banana is not constrained by these statements. It could be yellow, or it could be any other color.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot infer from these statements that \"The banana was not yellow\". We simply don't have enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
