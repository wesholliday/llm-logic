            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mary was not at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if Mary was not at the wedding, this statement tells us nothing about whether Sue was or was not at the wedding.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\n4) However, just because Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot conclude anything about Sue. Sue could have been at the wedding or not, independent of Mary's presence.\n\n5) The conditional statement only tells us about Sue in the case that Mary was at the wedding, but we know that Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, we do not have enough information to conclude whether Sue was or was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
