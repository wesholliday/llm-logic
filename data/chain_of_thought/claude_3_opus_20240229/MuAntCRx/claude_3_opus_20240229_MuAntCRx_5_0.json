            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer the statement \"The plonk must zibber for and be shimble for\" from the given statement \"The plonk must be shimble for\". The original statement only tells us that the plonk must have the property of being shimble. It says nothing about the plonk needing to zibber. Adding the requirement that the plonk must zibber is adding new information that is not contained or implied by the original statement. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
