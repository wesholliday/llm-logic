We cannot logically infer the second statement from the first, as it introduces new terms and assertions that are not present or implied by the original statement. The first statement only asserts that \"The wobble must be quork fizzle frozz\", while the second statement adds that it must also \"be glorp quank quork\" in addition to being \"quork fizzle frozz\". This additional information cannot be inferred from the first statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
