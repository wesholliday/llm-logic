The original statement only mentions that the quazzle must be flibbit by zizz. It says nothing about the quazzle being frazzle by flibbit. Adding that extra condition in the inferred statement is not supported by the information provided in the original statement. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
