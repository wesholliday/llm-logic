            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer 'The quazzle must quork blurble and gribble crunk' from the given statement 'The quazzle must gribble crunk'. The original statement only tells us that the quazzle must perform the action \"gribble crunk\". It does not mention anything about \"quork blurble\". So adding the additional requirement that the quazzle must also \"quork blurble\" is not supported by the initial statement. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
