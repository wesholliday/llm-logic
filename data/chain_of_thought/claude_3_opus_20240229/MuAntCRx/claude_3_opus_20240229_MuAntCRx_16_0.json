            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. The first statement says \"The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble\". It does not mention anything about the grooble snorking wozzle grooble. So the second statement introduces new information that is not contained or implied by the first statement. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information. Adding the claim that the grooble must also snork wozzle grooble goes beyond what can be validly inferred.\n\nAnswer: no"
