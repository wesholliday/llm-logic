            "content": "Explanation: We cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. The first statement says \"The plonk must frozz floob gronk\". It does not mention anything about the plonk blimpling or quibbling. So there is no basis in the first statement to conclude that \"The plonk must blimple quibble frozz\". The first part of the second statement introduces new information not contained or implied by the first statement. The second part \"and frozz floob gronk\" does match the first statement. But since the second statement as a whole contains additional claims beyond what the first statement said, it cannot be validly inferred just from the information given in the first statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
