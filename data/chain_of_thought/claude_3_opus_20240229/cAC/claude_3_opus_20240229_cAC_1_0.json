            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is a necessary consequence of Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if Mary was there, Sue must have been there too.\n\n3) However, the converse is not necessarily true. The statement does not say anything about what happens if Sue was at the wedding. Mary may or may not have been there.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding. \n\n5) But this doesn't give us any information about whether Mary was at the wedding. Sue could have been at the wedding with or without Mary.\n\n6) Therefore, we do not have enough information to conclude that Mary was at the wedding. The given statements do not rule out the possibility that Sue was at the wedding without Mary.\n\nAnswer: no"
