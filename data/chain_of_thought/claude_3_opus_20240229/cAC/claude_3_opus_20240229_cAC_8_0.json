            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n   - \"The mummy was awake\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is true, then the consequence \"the mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, this conditional statement does not say anything about what happens if the mummy was awake. It does not state that the vampire must be awake if the mummy is awake.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that \"the mummy was awake\", but this doesn't give us any information about the vampire.\n\n5) It's possible that the mummy was awake for some other reason, not because the vampire was awake. Maybe the mummy just doesn't sleep much!\n\n6) Therefore, just because the mummy was awake, we can't conclude for certain that the vampire was also awake. The given statements don't provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
