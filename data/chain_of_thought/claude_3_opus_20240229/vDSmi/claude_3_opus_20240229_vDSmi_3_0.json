This introduces an element of uncertainty.\n\n4) \"Possibly not B\" does not necessarily mean \"not B\". It leaves open the possibility that B could still be true.\n\n5) For the conclusion \"A\" to follow necessarily, we would need to be certain that B is not true. But \"possibly not B\" does not give us that certainty.\n\n6) Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion \"A\" could be false even if both premises are true.\n\nAnswer: no"
