Just because B might not be true, it doesn't necessarily mean that A must be true.\n\n3) For the argument to be valid, the second premise would need to be \"B is not true\" (rather than \"B might not be true\"). Then the argument would have the form:\n   Premise 1: Either A or B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: A\n   This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\n4) But with the second premise as \"B might not be true\", we can't conclusively say that A is true. B could still be true, in which case we don't know whether A is true or not.\n\n5) Therefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
