This is not the same as stating that the shoes are definitely not by the door.\n\n4) The conclusion states that the shoes are in the closet (A).\n\n5) For this form of argument to be valid, the truth of the premises must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. \n\n6) However, even if we accept both premises as true, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow. Premise 2 only states that B might not be true, not that it's definitely false. If B is actually true (i.e., the shoes are by the door), then A could be false (i.e., the shoes might not be in the closet).\n\n7) Therefore, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
