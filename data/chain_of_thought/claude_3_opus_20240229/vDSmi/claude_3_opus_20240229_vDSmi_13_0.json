In other words, we're not certain that B is true.\n\n4) The conclusion states that the toy is definitely in the box (A).\n\n5) However, from the premises, we can't be certain that A is true. Premise 2 only says that B might not be true, not that it definitely isn't true. \n\n6) If B were definitely false, then we could conclude A (since Premise 1 says it must be one or the other). But since B is only possibly false, we can't be sure that A is true.\n\n7) Therefore, the argument is invalid. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
