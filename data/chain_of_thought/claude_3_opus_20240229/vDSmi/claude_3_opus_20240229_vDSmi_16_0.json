But it doesn't say that B is definitely false.\n\n4) The conclusion asserts A. \n\n5) For this argument to be valid, the truth of the premises must guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n6) However, even if we accept both premises as true, the conclusion could still be false. Why? Because if B is actually true (even though premise 2 allows for the possibility of B being false), then A could be either true or false, given premise 1.\n\n7) In other words, the premises allow for a situation where B is true and A is false, in which case the conclusion would be false.\n\n8) Therefore, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
