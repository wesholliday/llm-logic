In modal logic, \"possibly not B\" does not negate B. It just means there is a possible world where B is not true, but it doesn't mean B is necessarily false in the actual world.\n\n4) For the argument to be valid, the truth of the premises must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. But here, even if we accept both premises as true, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow. \n\n5) Consider a case where both A and B are true. This satisfies Premise 1 (since one of them is true), and it also satisfies Premise 2 (since B might not be true in some other possible world, even if it is true in the actual world). But in this case, the conclusion A is not necessarily true, since we assumed both A and B are true.\n\n6) Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. The truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion in all cases.\n\nAnswer: no"
