Let's assume this interpretation for now.\n\n3) \"Possibly not B\" does not negate B. It just states that there's a possibility that B might not be true. This is different from stating \"not B\".\n\n4) For the conclusion \"A\" to follow logically, we would need the second premise to definitively negate B, i.e., to state \"not B\".\n\n5) Since \"Possibly not B\" does not definitively negate B, the conclusion \"A\" does not necessarily follow.\n\n6) Even if we interpret \"Either A or B\" as an inclusive or (allowing the possibility of both A and B being true), the conclusion still doesn't follow. We would still need a definitive \"not B\" to conclude \"A\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
