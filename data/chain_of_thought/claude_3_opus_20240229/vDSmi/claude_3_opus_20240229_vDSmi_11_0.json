In other words, it leaves open the possibility that B is false.\n\n4) The conclusion asserts that A is definitely true.\n\n5) However, just because B might not be true (as stated in Premise 2), that doesn't necessarily mean that A must be true. It could be the case that B is actually true despite the possibility of it being false.\n\n6) For the conclusion to follow logically, Premise 2 would need to assert that B is definitely not true, rather than just possibly not true.\n\n7) As it stands, the argument commits the fallacy of asserting the consequent. Just because one of the options in a disjunction might be false, we can't conclude that the other option must be true.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
