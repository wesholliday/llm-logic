It only states that B might not be true, which leaves open the possibility that B could still be true.\n\n4) If we're not certain that B is false, then we can't conclude with certainty that A must be true. There's still a possibility that B could be true, in which case the conclusion that A is true wouldn't necessarily follow.\n\n5) Therefore, because Premise 2 expresses a possibility rather than a certainty, the argument does not have a form that guarantees its validity.\n\nAnswer: no"
