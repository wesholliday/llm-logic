            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The fribble might be on the blurble or in the wobble\" presents two possible locations for the fribble: on the blurble or in the wobble. The word \"or\" indicates that these are alternatives, meaning the fribble could be in either location.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, \"The fribble might be on the blurble\", is one of the two alternatives presented in the original statement. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the fribble being on the blurble, we can logically infer that \"The fribble might be on the blurble\" is true based on the information given.\n\nIt's important to note that the original statement does not specify that the fribble is definitely on the blurble, only that it might be. Therefore, we can infer the possibility, but not the certainty, of the fribble being on the blurble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
