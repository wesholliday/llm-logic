This means that the fizzle might be glorp for either a quimble or a quibble. \n\nThe question is asking if we can infer from this that \"The fizzle might be glorp for a quimble\". \n\nSince the original statement says the fizzle might be glorp for a quimble OR quibble, it logically follows that the fizzle might indeed be glorp for a quimble specifically. If A or B is true, then we can infer that A might be true.\n\nSo yes, from the original statement, it is valid to infer that the fizzle might be glorp for a quimble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
