            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck might not have been blue\"\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n\n2) The first statement tells us that it's possible the truck was not blue. In other words, we can't be certain that the truck was blue.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it says that if the car was red, then we can infer that the truck must have been blue.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The car was not red\".\n\n5) If the car was red, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been blue. But the first statement says the truck might not have been blue.\n\n6) So if the car was red, we would have a contradiction: the truck would have to be blue (according to statement 2) and might not be blue (according to statement 1) at the same time.\n\n7) The only way to avoid this contradiction is if the car was not red. If the car was not red, then statement 2 doesn't apply, and there's no contradiction with statement 1.\n\n8) Therefore, to maintain consistency between the two given statements, we must infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
