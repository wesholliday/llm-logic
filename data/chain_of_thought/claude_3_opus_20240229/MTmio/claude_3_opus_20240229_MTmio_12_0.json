            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\"\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n\n2) The first statement tells us that it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. In other words, we don't know for certain whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it tells us that if a certain condition is met (Joe going to the park), then a certain consequence must follow (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\n4) Now, we want to know whether we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park\".\n\n5) If Joe did go to the park, then according to the second statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, this would contradict the first statement, which allows for the possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n6) Therefore, in order for both statements to be true, it must be the case that Joe did not go to the park. If Joe had gone to the park, it would force Lucy to have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
