            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The banana might not have been yellow\"\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the apple was red, it necessarily follows that the banana was yellow.\n\n3) The first statement suggests that it's possible that the banana was not yellow.\n\n4) If the apple was red, then according to the second statement, the banana must have been yellow. But this would contradict the first statement, which allows for the possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n\n5) Therefore, for both statements to be true simultaneously, it must be the case that the apple was not red. This way, the second statement (being a conditional) says nothing about the color of the banana, and the first statement can be true without contradiction.\n\n6) Thus, from these two statements together, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
