            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The truck might not have been metal\"\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the doll was plastic, it necessarily follows that the truck was metal.\n\n3. Now, the first statement suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\n4. If the doll was plastic, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal. However, this contradicts the first statement which allows for the possibility of the truck not being metal.\n\n5. Therefore, for both statements to be true simultaneously, it must be the case that the doll was not plastic. If the doll was plastic, it would lead to a contradiction between the two statements.\n\n6. So, we can indeed infer that the doll was not plastic, as it is the only way to resolve the potential contradiction between the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
