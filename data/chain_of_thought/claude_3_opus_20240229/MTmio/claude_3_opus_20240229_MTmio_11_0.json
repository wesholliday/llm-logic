            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\"\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the cake was chocolate, then it necessarily follows that the muffins were blueberry.\n\n3) Now, the first statement says that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This suggests that it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n4) If the muffins were not blueberry, then according to the second statement, it cannot be the case that the cake was chocolate. Because if the cake was chocolate, the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry (as stated in the first statement), then it must be possible that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
