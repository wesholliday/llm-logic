            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Mary's presence at the wedding necessarily implies Sue's presence. In other words, it is not possible for Mary to have been at the wedding without Sue also being there.\n\n3) Now, the first statement says that it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding. This directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement (the part after \"then\").\n\n4) If the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the part after \"if\") must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it isn't in this case.\n\n5) Therefore, since it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding (making the consequent of the conditional false), it must also be the case that Mary was not at the wedding (making the antecedent of the conditional false).\n\nAnswer: yes"
