            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The first statement tells us that it's possible that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. In other words, we don't know for certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: it tells us that if a certain condition is met (Lisa buying the red shirt), then a certain consequence must follow (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\n5) Let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: \n   - If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n6) From the first statement, we know that it's possible that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\n7) If Mark indeed didn't buy the blue shirt, then according to the contrapositive (step 5), Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt.\n\n8) However, the first statement doesn't say that Mark definitely didn't buy the blue shirt, only that he might not have. So we can't say for certain that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\n9) Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The information given is not sufficient to make that conclusion with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
