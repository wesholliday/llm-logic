We are given two statements:\n   - \"The pants might not have been denim\"\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the shirt was cotton, it necessarily follows that the pants were denim.\n\n3. The first statement suggests that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\n4. If the pants were not denim, then according to the second statement, the shirt could not have been cotton. Because if the shirt was cotton, the pants would have to be denim.\n\n5. Therefore, from the possibility that the pants were not denim, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
