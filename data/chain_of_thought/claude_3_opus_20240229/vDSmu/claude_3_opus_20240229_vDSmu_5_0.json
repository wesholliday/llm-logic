This is the definition of a valid argument form.\n\n5) In the given argument, A is \"the cookies are in the jar\" and B is \"the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\". The form of the argument is exactly the same as the valid form we analyzed.\n\nTherefore, since the given argument has the same form as a logically valid argument form, we can conclude that this specific argument is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
