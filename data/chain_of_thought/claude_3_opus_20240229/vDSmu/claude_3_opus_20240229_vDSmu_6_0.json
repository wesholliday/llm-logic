It states that if we have a disjunction (an 'either...or...' statement) and we negate one of the disjuncts, we can conclude the other disjunct.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   A = The phone is in the living room\n   B = The phone must be ringing in the kitchen\n\n   Premise 1 states: Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n   Premise 2 states: It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n   The conclusion is: The phone is in the living room.\n\n4) This follows the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism. If we assume the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
