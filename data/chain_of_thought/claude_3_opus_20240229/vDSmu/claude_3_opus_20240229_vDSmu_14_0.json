This is a valid form of argument known as Disjunctive Syllogism or Modus Tollendo Ponens. It states that if we have a disjunction (an \"either-or\" statement) and we negate one of the disjuncts, we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true.\n\n3. In this specific case:\n   A = The milk is on the counter\n   B = The milk must be chilling in the fridge\n\n4. The argument states:\n   Premise 1: Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n   Premise 2: It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n   Conclusion: The milk is on the counter.\n\n5. This follows the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism. If we assume the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
