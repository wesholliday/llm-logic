It says that one of two things must be true: either the sprocket must be daggled, or the sprocket is cranked.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those possibilities is not true. Specifically, it says that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\n4) If we know that one of the two possibilities in an either/or situation is not true, then the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, then it must be the case that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
