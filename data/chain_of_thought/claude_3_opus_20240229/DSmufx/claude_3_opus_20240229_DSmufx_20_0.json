It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The fleeg must be surned\n   - The fleeg is bluttered\n\n3) The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction. It says:\n   - It is not true that the fleeg must be surned\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Since we are told that \"the fleeg must be surned\" is not true, then for the first statement to be true, \"the fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
