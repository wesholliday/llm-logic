It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The flugel must be zargled\n   - The flugel is blimmed\n\n3) The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the flugel must be zargled.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) So, if \"the flugel must be zargled\" is not true (as stated by the second statement), then for the first statement to be true, \"the flugel is blimmed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"the flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
