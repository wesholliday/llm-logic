It says either \"the flug must be zimmed\" is true, or \"the flug is blummed\" is true, or both are true.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the first part of the disjunction in (a). It says \"the flug must be zimmed\" is not true.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then from (b), we know that \"the flug must be zimmed\" is false.\n\n5) But (a) says that either \"the flug must be zimmed\" or \"the flug is blummed\" must be true.\n\n6) Since we've determined that \"the flug must be zimmed\" is false, for (a) to be true, \"the flug is blummed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, if we accept the truth of both given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the flug is blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
