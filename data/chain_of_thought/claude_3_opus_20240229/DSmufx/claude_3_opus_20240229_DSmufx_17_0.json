It says that at least one of these must be true: either the flob must be movated, or the flob is skizzled.\n\n3) The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the flob must be movated.\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) So, if \"the flob must be movated\" is false (as the second statement tells us), then for the first statement to be true, \"the flob is skizzled\" must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"the flob is skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
