It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The grommet must be plopped\n   - The grommet is sploffed\n\n3) The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction. It says:\n   - It is not true that the grommet must be plopped\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Since we know that \"the grommet must be plopped\" is not true, for the disjunction to be true, \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
