In other words, either \"the fribble must be crinked\" is true, or \"it is snurgled\" is true, or both are true.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the first part of the disjunction in (a). It states that \"the fribble must be crinked\" is not true.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then we can conclude:\n   - From (b), \"the fribble must be crinked\" is not true.\n   - But from (a), we know that either \"the fribble must be crinked\" or \"it is snurgled\" must be true.\n   - Since \"the fribble must be crinked\" is not true, then for (a) to be true, \"it is snurgled\" must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if we accept the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
