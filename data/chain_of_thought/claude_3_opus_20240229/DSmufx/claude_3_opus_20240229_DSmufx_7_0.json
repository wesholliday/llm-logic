It says that either the whiffle must be tinked, or the whiffle is shanked.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the first part of the disjunction in (a). It says that it's not true that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\n4) If the first part of a disjunction is false, then for the whole disjunction to be true (which we assume it is), the second part must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked, then for the disjunction in (a) to be true, it must be the case that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
