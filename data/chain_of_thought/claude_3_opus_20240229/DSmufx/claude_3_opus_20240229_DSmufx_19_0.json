It says that at least one of these must be true: either the smonk must be plagged, or the smonk is vreebled.\n\n3) The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the smonk must be plagged.\n\n4) In logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q), and we know that one part is false (not P), then we can infer that the other part must be true (Q).\n\n5) Applying this to our statements:\n   - P: \"the smonk must be plagged\"\n   - Q: \"the smonk is vreebled\"\n   - We are told \"not P\"\n\n6) Therefore, since we have \"P or Q\" and \"not P\", we can infer \"Q\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
