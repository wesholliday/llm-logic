It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The smip must be lupped\n   - The smip is shripped\n\n3) The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction. It says:\n   - It is not true that the smip must be lupped\n\n4) If it's not true that the smip must be lupped, then for the disjunction to be true, the other part must be true. That is:\n   - The smip is shripped\n\n5) Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
