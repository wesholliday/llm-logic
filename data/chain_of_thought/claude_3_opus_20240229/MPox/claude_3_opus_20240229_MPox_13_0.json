We are also given the conditional statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"The glip was tragged\".\n\n3. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement P and a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can infer Q.\n\n4. In this case, we have both the statement P (\"The glip was slogged\") and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (\"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\").\n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer Q, which is \"The glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
