We are also told that \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\". This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (\"the fleeg was bluttered\") is true, then the second part (\"it surned\") must also be true.\n\n3. From step 1, we know that \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is indeed true. \n\n4. Therefore, the condition in the conditional statement from step 2 is met.\n\n5. This means that the consequence of the conditional statement must also be true. In other words, \"it surned\" or \"the fleeg surned\" must be true.\n\nSo, by combining the information from the two given statements and using logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The fleeg surned\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
