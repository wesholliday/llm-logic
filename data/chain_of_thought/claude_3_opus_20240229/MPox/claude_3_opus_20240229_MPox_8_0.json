            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket was cranked\"\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the sprocket was indeed cranked. This matches the condition (the \"if\" part) of the second statement.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true, then the consequence \"the sprocket was daggled\" must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket was cranked, we can apply the conditional from the second statement. \n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThis type of reasoning is called \"modus ponens\" in logic. It states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition of that statement is also true, then the consequence must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes"
