We are also given the conditional statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"the smip lupped the zoint\". \n\n3. In logic, there is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement P, and we also have the statement \"If P, then Q\", then we can infer Q.\n\n4. In this case, we have both the statement P (\"The smip was shripped\") and the statement \"If P, then Q\" (\"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\").\n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer Q, which is \"The smip lupped the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
