            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are told that \"The sneg was crampled\". So we know this statement is true.\n\n2. We are also told \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\". This is a conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n\n3. In this case, P is the statement \"the sneg was crampled\", and Q is the statement \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\n4. We already know from step 1 that \"the sneg was crampled\" is true. \n\n5. Therefore, since the condition in the conditional statement is met (i.e., P is true), we can conclude that the consequence must also be true (i.e., Q is true).\n\n6. In other words, since \"the sneg was crampled\" is true, and we have the rule \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\", we can infer that \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
