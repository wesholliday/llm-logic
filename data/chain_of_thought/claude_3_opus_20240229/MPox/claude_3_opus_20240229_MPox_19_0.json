We are also told that \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\". This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (\"the smonk was vreebled\") is true, then the second part (\"the smonk plagged\") must also be true.\n\n3. From step 1, we know that \"the smonk was vreebled\" is indeed true. \n\n4. Therefore, based on the conditional in step 2, we can conclude that \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n\n5. So, from the two given statements, we can validly infer that \"The smonk plagged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
