We are also given the conditional statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"The shank was nugged\". \n\n3. In logic, there is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement P, and we also have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", then we can infer the statement Q.\n\n4. In this case, we have both the statement P (\"The shank was plooked\") and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (\"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\"). \n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer the statement Q, which is \"The shank was nugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
