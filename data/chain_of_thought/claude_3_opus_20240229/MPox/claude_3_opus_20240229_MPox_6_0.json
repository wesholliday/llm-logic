            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the statement \"The grommet was sploffed\". Let's call this statement P.\n\n2. We are also given the conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"The grommet plopped the frink\".\n\n3. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", and we also know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\n4. In this case, we know that P is true (from statement 1), and we have the conditional \"If P, then Q\" (from statement 2). \n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer that Q is true, i.e., \"The grommet plopped the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
