We are also told \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\". This is a conditional statement - it says that *if* the first part is true (the fribble was snurgled), *then* the second part must also be true (the fribble crinked).\n\n3. From step 1, we know the first part of the conditional statement in step 2 is indeed true - the fribble was snurgled. \n\n4. Therefore, since the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is true, the \"then\" part must also be true. In other words, it must be the case that the fribble crinked.\n\n5. So yes, from the two given statements, we can logically infer that \"The fribble crinked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
