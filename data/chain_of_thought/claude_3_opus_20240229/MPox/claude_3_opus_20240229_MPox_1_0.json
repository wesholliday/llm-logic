It states that if the condition \"the flugel was blimmed\" is true, then the consequence \"the flugel was zargled\" must also be true.\n\n4) Now, from the first statement, we know that the condition in the second statement (\"the flugel was blimmed\") is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the logic of the conditional in the second statement, the consequence (\"the flugel was zargled\") must also be true.\n\n6) So, from these two statements together, we can indeed infer that \"The flugel was zargled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
