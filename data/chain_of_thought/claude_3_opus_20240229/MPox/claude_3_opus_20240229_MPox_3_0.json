We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat was morphed\"\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple assertion: it states that the splat was indeed morphed.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the splat was morphed\" is true, then the consequence \"the splat quanked\" must also be true.\n\n4. Now, from the first statement, we know that the condition in the second statement is satisfied: the splat was indeed morphed.\n\n5. Therefore, the consequence in the second statement must also hold: the splat quanked.\n\nSo, by combining the information from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The splat quanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
