We are also given the conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"The clug snugged\".\n\n3. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement P, and we also have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", then we can infer Q.\n\n4. In this case, we have both the statement P (\"The clug was fleeked\") and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (\"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\").\n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer Q, which is \"The clug snugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
