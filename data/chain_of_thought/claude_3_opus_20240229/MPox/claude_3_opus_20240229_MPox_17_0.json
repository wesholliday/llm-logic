We are also given the conditional statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"The flob movated\".\n\n3. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement P, and we also have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", then we can infer Q.\n\n4. In this case, we have both the statement P (\"The flob was skizzled\") and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (\"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\").\n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer Q, which is \"The flob movated\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
