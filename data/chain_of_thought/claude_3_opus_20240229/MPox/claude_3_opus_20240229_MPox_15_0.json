We are also given the conditional statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"The dreb was spened\". \n\n3. In logic, there is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens which states that if we have a statement P, and we also have the statement \"If P, then Q\", we can infer the statement Q.\n\n4. In this case, we have both the statement P (\"The dreb was vroombed\") and the statement \"If P, then Q\" (\"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"). \n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer the statement Q, which is \"The dreb was spened\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
