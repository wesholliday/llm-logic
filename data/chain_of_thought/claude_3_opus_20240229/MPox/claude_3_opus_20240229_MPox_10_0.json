We are also given the conditional statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"it was garpled\". \n\n3. In logic, when we have a statement P, and a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude Q. This rule of inference is called \"modus ponens\".\n\n4. Applying modus ponens here:\n   - We have P: \"The wug was sproinged\"\n   - We have \"If P, then Q\": \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n   - Therefore, we can conclude Q: \"It was garpled\"\n\n5. So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"It was garpled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
