We are also given the conditional statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\". This is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where Q is the statement \"It was varnished\".\n\n3. In logic, there is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", and we also know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\n4. In this case, we know that \"The twonk was plinked\" (P) is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" (If P, then Q).\n\n5. Therefore, by Modus Ponens, we can infer that \"It was varnished\" (Q) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
