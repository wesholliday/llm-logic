            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" is a compound sentence that consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction \"and\". The first independent clause is \"The investment might be risky\", and the second independent clause is \"[The investment might] offer high returns\".\n\nWhen a compound sentence is formed using the conjunction \"and\", both independent clauses are considered to be true. Therefore, if the original statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" is true, then each of its independent clauses must also be true.\n\nSince \"The investment might be risky\" is one of the independent clauses in the original statement, we can infer that this clause is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
