The athlete might be injured\n2. The athlete is unable to compete\n\nThe first part, \"The athlete might be injured,\" is a standalone statement that is directly stated within the original sentence. Therefore, we can infer this statement from the original sentence without any additional information or assumptions.\n\nThe second part, \"unable to compete,\" provides additional information about the consequence of the athlete's potential injury, but it does not affect the validity of the first part of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
