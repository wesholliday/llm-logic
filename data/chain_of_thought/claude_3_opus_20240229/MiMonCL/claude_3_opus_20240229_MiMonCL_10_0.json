            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project might be delayed and require additional funding\" is a compound statement that consists of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The project might be delayed\n2. The project might require additional funding\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are joined by the conjunction \"and\", if the compound statement is true, then both individual statements must also be true. \n\nTherefore, if the statement \"The project might be delayed and require additional funding\" is true, then it logically follows that the statement \"The project might be delayed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
