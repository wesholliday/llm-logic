            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients\" is a compound sentence that consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction \"and\". The first independent clause is \"The recipe might be complicated\", and the second independent clause is \"[The recipe might] require exotic ingredients\".\n\nSince the first independent clause, \"The recipe might be complicated\", is explicitly stated within the original sentence, we can directly infer this statement from the given sentence without any additional assumptions or logical leaps.\n\nAnswer: yes"
