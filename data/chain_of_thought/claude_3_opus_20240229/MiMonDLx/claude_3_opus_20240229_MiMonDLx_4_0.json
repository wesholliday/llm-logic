We are given that \"The plimp might be wobble\" is true. If the plimp might be wobble, then it is certainly true that the plimp might be wobble or blimple, regardless of whether it might be blimple or not. The truth of one disjunct is sufficient to make the overall disjunction true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
