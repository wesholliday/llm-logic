When we say something \"might\" be the case, it means there are other possibilities too.\n\nThe second statement \"The blimple might be on the flump or in the wobble\" is just making one of those other possibilities explicit. It's not saying anything that contradicts the first statement. \n\nIn fact, the second statement logically follows from the first. If the blimple might be on the flump, then it's also true that the blimple might be on the flump or in the wobble, or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nSo yes, we can validly infer the second statement from the first. The second statement is a logical consequence of the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
