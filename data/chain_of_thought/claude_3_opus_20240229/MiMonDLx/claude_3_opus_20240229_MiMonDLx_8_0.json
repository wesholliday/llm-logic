            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The gribble might be quork\" means there is a possibility that the gribble is quork. If we add \"or grazzle\" to this statement to make it \"The gribble might be quork or grazzle\", we are expanding the possibilities of what the gribble could be. By adding another option with \"or\", we are not contradicting or negating the original statement. The gribble might still be quork, but now there is also the additional possibility that it could be grazzle. Since the new statement allows for the original possibility and simply adds to it, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
