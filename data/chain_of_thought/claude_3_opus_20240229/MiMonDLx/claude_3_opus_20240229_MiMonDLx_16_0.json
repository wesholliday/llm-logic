            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibber might be froodle\" means there is a possibility that the zibber is froodle. If we add \"or on wibble\" to this statement, we are expanding the possibilities of what the zibber might be. The zibber could be either froodle or on wibble, according to the expanded statement.\n\nSince the original statement is included within the expanded statement (as one of the possibilities), the expanded statement does not contradict the original one. If the zibber might be froodle, then it is also true that the zibber might be froodle or on wibble, because \"froodle\" is one of the options in the \"froodle or on wibble\" statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble\" from the original statement \"The zibber might be froodle\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
