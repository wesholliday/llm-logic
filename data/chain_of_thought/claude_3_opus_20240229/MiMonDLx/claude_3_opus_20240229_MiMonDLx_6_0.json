            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wozzle might be flump\" means there is a possibility that the wozzle is flump. If we add \"or snork\" to this statement, we are saying that the wozzle might be either flump or snork. This new statement allows for an additional possibility (snork) beyond what was originally stated (flump).\n\nIn logic, if a statement A is true, then a statement \"A or B\" must also be true, regardless of whether B is true or false. This is because \"or\" in logic is inclusive, meaning at least one of the options must be true for the overall statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, if \"The wozzle might be flump\" is true, then \"The wozzle might be flump or snork\" must also be true, as it includes the original possibility (flump) and adds another (snork).\n\nAnswer: yes"
