            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz\" leaves open the possibility that the blurble could be something else besides wibble a frozz. By adding \"or plonk\" to create the new statement \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz or plonk\", we are expanding the possibilities of what the blurble could be, rather than limiting them. The new statement is less specific, but it still includes the original possibility that the blurble might be wibble a frozz. Since the new statement allows for everything the original statement allowed for and more, the new statement logically follows from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes"
