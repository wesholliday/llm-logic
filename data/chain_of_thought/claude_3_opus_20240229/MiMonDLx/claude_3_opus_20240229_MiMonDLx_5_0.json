            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibble might be wozzle\" means there is a possibility that the zibble is wozzle. If we add \"or snork\" to this statement, we are saying that the zibble might be either wozzle or snork. This new statement allows for an additional possibility (snork) beyond what was originally stated (wozzle). \n\nSince the new statement \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork\" includes the original possibility of the zibble being wozzle, while also allowing for the additional possibility of the zibble being snork, it is a logical inference from the original statement. The new statement does not contradict the original, but rather expands the possibilities in a logically consistent way.\n\nAnswer: yes"
