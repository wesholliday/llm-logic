            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snork might be plonk\" means there is a possibility that the snork is plonk. If we add \"or wobble\" to this statement to make it \"The snork might be plonk or wobble\", we are expanding the possibilities of what the snork could be. The new statement allows for the snork to be either plonk or wobble.\n\nSince the original statement is included unchanged within the new statement, and the new statement only adds an additional possibility without contradicting the original, we can logically infer the new statement from the original. If it's possible that the snork is plonk, then it's also possible that the snork is either plonk or wobble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
