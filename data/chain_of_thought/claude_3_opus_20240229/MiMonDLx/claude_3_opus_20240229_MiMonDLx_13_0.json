            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zooble might be quork\" means there is a possibility that the zooble is quork. If we add \"or grazzle\" to this statement to make it \"The zooble might be quork or grazzle\", we are expanding the possibilities of what the zooble could be. By adding another option with \"or\", we are not contradicting or negating the original possibility that the zooble might be quork. The new statement allows for the zooble to be either quork or grazzle, which is logically consistent with the original statement that allows for the zooble to be quork. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
