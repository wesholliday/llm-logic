            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". \n   Let's call \"the cake was chocolate\" proposition P, and \"the muffins were blueberry\" proposition Q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\".\n   This is equivalent to: \"If not Q, then not P\".\n   In symbolic form, this is: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\n3) In propositional logic, there's a rule called the contrapositive. It states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n   The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n4) Therefore, the statement \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (P \u2192 Q).\n\n5) Since a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
