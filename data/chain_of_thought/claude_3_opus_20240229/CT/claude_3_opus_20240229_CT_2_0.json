            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the original statement. In other words, can we infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\"?\n\n3) This is a question about the contrapositive of a conditional statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\", we can indeed infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
