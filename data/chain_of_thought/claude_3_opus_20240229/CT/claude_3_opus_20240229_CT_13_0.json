The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" because the second statement is the contrapositive of the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
