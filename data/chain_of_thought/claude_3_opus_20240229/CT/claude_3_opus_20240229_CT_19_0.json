In other words, can we infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of the contrapositive is true. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4) In general, if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. However, the converse of a statement (which would be \"If Q, then P\") is not necessarily true.\n\n5) Therefore, since the given statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", we can infer its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\", which is exactly what the question is asking.\n\nAnswer: yes"
