            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\", let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. The given statement is a conditional: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n   - The antecedent (the \"if\" part) is \"Sue chose pizza\".\n   - The consequent (the \"then\" part) is \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is also a conditional: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n   - The antecedent is \"Bob did not choose pasta\".\n   - The consequent is \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\n3. We can see that the antecedent of the second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement, and the consequent of the second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the first statement.\n\n4. This is a valid form of inference called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
