            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n   Let's call \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" proposition p, and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" proposition q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: p \u2192 q\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n   This is equivalent to: \"If not q, then not p\".\n   In symbolic form, this is: \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\n\n3) In propositional logic, the statement \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is called the contrapositive of the statement p \u2192 q.\n\n4) A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
