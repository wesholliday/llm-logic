The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is the contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (P \u2192 Q), and they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
