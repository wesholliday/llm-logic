            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". \n   Let's call \"the doll was plastic\" proposition P, and \"the truck was metal\" proposition Q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n   This is equivalent to: \"If not Q, then not P\".\n   In symbolic form, this is: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\n3) In propositional logic, there is a rule called the contrapositive. It states that for any conditional statement \"if P then Q\", the contrapositive \"if not Q then not P\" is always true.\n\n4) Therefore, from the original statement P \u2192 Q, we can always infer the contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n5) So, from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\", we can indeed infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
