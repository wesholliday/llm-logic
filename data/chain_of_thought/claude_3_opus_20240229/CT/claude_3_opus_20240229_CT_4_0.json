Therefore, if Q is not true, P cannot be true either, otherwise the original statement would be false.\n\n5) So, from the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\", we can indeed infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
