            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". In logic, this is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement. This is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3) In logic, the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" is known as the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\". \n\n4) A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That means if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
