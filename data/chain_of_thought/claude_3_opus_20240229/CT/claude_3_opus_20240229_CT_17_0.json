It states that:\n   If P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\n4) Applying this rule to our problem:\n   Given P \u2192 Q is true (from the original statement),\n   We can infer that \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\", we can indeed infer that \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
