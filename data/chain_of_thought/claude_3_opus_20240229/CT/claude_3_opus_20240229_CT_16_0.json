In other words, can we infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4) The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5) However, the converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\". The converse is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6) Since the question is asking about the converse of the contrapositive, and the converse is not always equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
