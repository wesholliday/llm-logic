In other words, can we infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"?\n\n3) In logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". This is known as the contrapositive.\n\n4) Therefore, from the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\", we can indeed infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
