That means if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
