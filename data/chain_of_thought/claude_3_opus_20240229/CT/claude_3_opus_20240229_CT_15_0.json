In other words, can we infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\"?\n\n3) This is a question of whether the converse of the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4) The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". This is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5) The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\". This is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6) However, the converse of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, because the contrapositive itself is logically equivalent to the original statement, and taking the converse of a logically equivalent statement results in another logically equivalent statement.\n\n7) Therefore, \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" is logically equivalent to \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
