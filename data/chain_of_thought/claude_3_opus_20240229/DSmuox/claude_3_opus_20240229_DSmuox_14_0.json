In other words, it's possible that the clug is not snugged.\n\n3) The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the clug is fleeked, or the clug must be snugged. \n\n4) Now, from the first statement, we know that it's not true that the clug must be snugged. So in the second statement, the possibility \"the clug must be snugged\" is ruled out.\n\n5) That leaves us with only one possibility from the second statement: \"the clug is fleeked\".\n\nTherefore, given the two initial statements, we can indeed infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
