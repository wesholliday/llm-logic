In other words, there are cases where the flugel is not zargled.\n\n2) The second statement presents a disjunction (an either/or): either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. \n\n3) Now, we know from (1) that the second disjunct (\"it must be zargled\") is not always true - there are cases where the flugel is not zargled.\n\n4) In those cases where the flugel is not zargled, for the disjunction in (2) to be true, the first disjunct (\"the flugel is blimmed\") must be true. \n\n5) Therefore, in the cases where the flugel is not zargled, we can indeed infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nHowever, this reasoning does not allow us to conclude that the flugel is always blimmed. There might be cases where the flugel is zargled, and in those cases, we can't infer anything about whether it's also blimmed.\n\nSo, can we infer 'The flugel is blimmed' in all cases? \n\nAnswer: no"
