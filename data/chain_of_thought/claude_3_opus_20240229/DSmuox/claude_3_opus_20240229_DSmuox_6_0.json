If it's not the case that something must happen, then it's possible for that thing not to happen. So the first statement is equivalent to:\n   - \"It's possible that the grommet is not plopped\"\n\n3) Now let's look at the second statement. It gives us two possibilities: either the grommet is sploffed, or it must be plopped.\n\n4) But from the first statement, we know that it's possible for the grommet not to be plopped. \n\n5) Therefore, the second possibility in the second statement (that the grommet must be plopped) cannot be true, because it contradicts the first statement.\n\n6) That leaves us with only one possibility from the second statement: the grommet is sploffed.\n\n7) Therefore, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
