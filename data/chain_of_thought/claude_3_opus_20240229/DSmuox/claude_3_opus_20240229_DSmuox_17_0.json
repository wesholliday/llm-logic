In other words, there are at least some cases where the flob is not movated.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. \n\n3) From the first statement, we know there exist cases where the flob is not movated. In those cases, for the second statement to still be true, it must be that the flob is skizzled.\n\n4) Therefore, whenever the flob is not movated, it is definitely skizzled. \n\n5) However, the statements don't tell us anything definitive about cases where the flob is movated. In those cases, it could be skizzled or not - we don't have enough information to say for sure.\n\n6) So while we can infer that the flob is definitely skizzled in cases where it's not movated, we can't infer that it's skizzled in all cases. The inference only holds some of the time, not universally.\n\nAnswer: no"
