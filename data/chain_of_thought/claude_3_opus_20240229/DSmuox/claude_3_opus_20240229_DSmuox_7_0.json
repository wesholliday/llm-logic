In other words, there are at least some cases where the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n2) The second statement presents a disjunction (an either/or): either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. \n\n3) Now, we know from (1) that it's not always the case that the whiffle must be tinked. So in those cases where it's not tinked, the second part of the disjunction in (2) is false.\n\n4) But for the overall disjunction in (2) to be true, if one part is false, the other part must be true. That means in those cases where the whiffle is not tinked, it must be shanked.\n\n5) Therefore, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
