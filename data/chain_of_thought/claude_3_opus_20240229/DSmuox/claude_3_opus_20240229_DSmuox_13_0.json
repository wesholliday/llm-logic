This means that it's possible for the glip to not be tragged. In other words, the glip being tragged is not necessary.\n\n2) The second statement says \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these two things must be true. \n\n3) Now, from the first statement, we know that \"the glip must be tragged\" is false. \n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the glip must be tragged\" is false, \"the glip is slogged\" must be true for the second statement to be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that \"the glip is slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
