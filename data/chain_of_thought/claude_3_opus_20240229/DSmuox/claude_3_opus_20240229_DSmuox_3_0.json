            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that the splat must be quanked. In other words, the splat being quanked is not guaranteed or required.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked. \n\n3) Now, we know from the first statement that the splat being quanked is not necessarily true. So in the either/or scenario of the second statement, the \"or it must be quanked\" part cannot be relied upon.\n\n4) This leaves us with the other possibility presented in the second statement - that the splat is morphed.\n\n5) Since the splat being quanked is not necessarily true based on the first statement, and the second statement says the splat is either morphed or must be quanked, we can infer that the splat must be morphed. It's the only possibility left that fits with both given statements.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the splat is morphed based on the information provided in the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
