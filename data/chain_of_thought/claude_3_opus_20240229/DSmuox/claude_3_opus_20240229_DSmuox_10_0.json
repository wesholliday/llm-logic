In other words, it's possible that the wug is not garpled.\n\n2) The second statement gives us a disjunction (an either/or): either the wug is sproinged, or it must be garpled. \n\n3) Now, if the wug must be garpled, that would contradict the first statement. So for the two statements to be consistent with each other, the first disjunct must be true: the wug must be sproinged.\n\n4) Therefore, from the two statements together, we can indeed infer that the wug is sproinged. If it wasn't, then by the second statement it would have to be garpled, but the first statement rules that out.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
