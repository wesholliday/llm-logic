In other words, the zinger being smoogled is not a certainty.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the zinger is fraggled, or it must be smoogled. \n\n3) Now, if we assume the zinger is not fraggled, then according to the second statement, it must be smoogled. \n\n4) However, the first statement contradicts this - it says the zinger being smoogled is not necessarily true.\n\n5) Therefore, for both statements to be true simultaneously, we must conclude that the assumption in step 3 was incorrect. In other words, the zinger must be fraggled.\n\n6) If the zinger was not fraggled, it would lead to a contradiction between the two given statements. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the zinger is indeed fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
