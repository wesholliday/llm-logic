In other words, the second part of the disjunction in (b) is not necessarily true.\n\n5) However, just because the second part of the disjunction is not necessarily true, it doesn't automatically make the first part true. The fribble could be snurgled, or it could be neither snurgled nor crinked.\n\n6) The statements do not provide enough information to determine conclusively that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no"
