In other words, there is at least the possibility that the shank is not nugged.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. \n\n3) Now, if we assume the shank is not nugged (which is possible based on the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\n4) Therefore, if the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked, based on the information given in the two statements.\n\n5) So we can indeed infer that the shank is plooked, assuming the truth of the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
