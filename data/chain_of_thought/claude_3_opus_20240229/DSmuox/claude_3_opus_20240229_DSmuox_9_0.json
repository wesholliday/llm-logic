In other words, there are at least some circumstances where the twonk is not plinked.\n\n2) The second statement presents a disjunction (an either/or): either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. \n\n3) Now, we know from the first statement that the second disjunct (\"it must be plinked\") is not always true. There are cases where the twonk is not plinked.\n\n4) In those cases where the twonk is not plinked, for the second statement to still be true, the first disjunct (\"the twonk is varnished\") must be true. \n\n5) Therefore, in at least those cases where the twonk is not plinked, it must be varnished, in order for both the initial statements to be true.\n\n6) So we can indeed infer that the twonk is varnished. It may not always be varnished, but it must be varnished in at least those cases where it is not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
