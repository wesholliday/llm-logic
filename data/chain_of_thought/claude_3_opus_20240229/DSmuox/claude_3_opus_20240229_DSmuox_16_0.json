In other words, the second part of the disjunction in the second statement might not be true.\n\n5) However, for the disjunction in the second statement to be true (which we are assuming it is), at least one part must be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"the sneg must be sproted\" is not necessarily true, then for the disjunction to be true, \"the sneg is crampled\" must be true.\n\n7) So, we can indeed infer that \"the sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
