In other words, there is at least the possibility that the smonk is not plagged.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. \n\n3) Now, if we assume the smonk is not plagged (which is possible based on the first statement), then according to the second statement, the smonk must be vreebled. \n\n4) The second statement doesn't allow for the possibility that the smonk is neither vreebled nor plagged. One of those two things must be true.\n\n5) So, if we rule out the possibility of the smonk being plagged based on the first statement, the only remaining possibility according to the second statement is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, yes, based on those two statements, we can logically infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
