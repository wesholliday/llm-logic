In other words, it is not necessarily true that the shoes are in the closet. \n\n2) The conclusion states \"The shoes might not be in the closet\". This means there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n3) If it is not necessarily true that the shoes are in the closet (premise), then it follows that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet (conclusion). \n\n4) The form of the argument is:\n   Premise: Not necessarily P\n   Conclusion: Possibly not P\n   This is a valid form of argument. Denying the necessity of something affirms the possibility of its opposite.\n\n5) Therefore, since the form of the argument is valid, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
