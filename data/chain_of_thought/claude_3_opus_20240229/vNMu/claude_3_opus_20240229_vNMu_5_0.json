This can be rephrased as \"It is not necessarily true that Jeff played basketball\".\n\n2) The conclusion states \"Jeff might not have played basketball\". This means there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n3) If it is not necessarily true that Jeff played basketball (premise), then there must be a possibility that he did not play basketball. \n\n4) The conclusion (there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball) follows logically from the premise (it is not necessarily true that Jeff played basketball).\n\n5) Therefore, the argument is logically valid. The truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
