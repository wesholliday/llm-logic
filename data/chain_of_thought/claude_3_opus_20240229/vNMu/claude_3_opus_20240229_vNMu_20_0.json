In other words, it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n2) The conclusion states \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\". This means there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\n3) If it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses are in her bag (premise), then it follows that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag (conclusion). \n\n4) The form of the argument is:\n   Premise: Not necessarily P\n   Conclusion: Possibly not P\n   This is a valid form of argument. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, since the form of the argument is valid, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise, the argument as a whole is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
