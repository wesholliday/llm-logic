            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The premise states: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\". \n   This means that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. In other words, there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2) The conclusion states: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\". \n   This means that there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n3) The premise and conclusion are saying essentially the same thing - that there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n4) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Here, if we accept the premise (that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding), then we must accept the conclusion (that Mary might not have been at the wedding).\n\n5) Therefore, the form of this argument is logically valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
