This can be rephrased as \"It is not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza\".\n\n2) The conclusion states \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\". This means there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n3) If it is not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza (premise), then there must be a possibility that she did not choose pizza. \n\n4) The conclusion (Sue might not have chosen pizza) follows logically from the premise (It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza).\n\n5) If the conclusion follows logically from the premise, then the argument form is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, since the conclusion follows logically from the premise, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
