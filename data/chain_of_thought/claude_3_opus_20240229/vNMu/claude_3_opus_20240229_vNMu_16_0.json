In other words, it's not necessarily true that the pen is in the bag. \n\n2) The conclusion states \"The pen might not be in my bag\". This means there's a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\n3) If it's not necessarily true that the pen is in the bag (premise), then it follows that there's a possibility the pen is not in the bag (conclusion). \n\n4) The form of the argument is:\n   Premise: Not necessarily P\n   Conclusion: Possibly not P\n   Where P is the proposition \"the pen is in my bag\".\n\n5) This form of argument is valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no way for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
