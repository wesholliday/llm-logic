In other words, it's not necessarily true that the scarf is in the backpack. \n\n2) The conclusion states \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\". This means there's a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\n3) If it's not necessarily true that the scarf is in the backpack (premise), then it follows that there's a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack (conclusion). \n\n4) The conclusion logically follows from the premise. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
