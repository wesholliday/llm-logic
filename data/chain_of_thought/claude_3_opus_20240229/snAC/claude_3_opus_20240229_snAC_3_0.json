It states that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain consequence follows (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n3) However, the truth of the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition (the book was written by James).\n\n4) In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, it doesn't necessarily mean that James wrote it. Someone else could have written the mystery novel.\n\n5) The conditional statement would only allow us to conclude that James wrote the book if we were told that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n6) But we are told that the book is a mystery novel, so we cannot conclude anything about whether or not James wrote it.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
