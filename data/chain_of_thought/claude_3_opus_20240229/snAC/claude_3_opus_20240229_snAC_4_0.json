This is because p \u2192 q does not imply q \u2192 p.\n\nFor example, consider the following:\n- If it rains, then the ground gets wet.\n- The ground is wet.\n\nWe cannot conclude from these statements that it rained, because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, like someone watering their lawn.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, just because the robot visited Jupiter (q is true), and we know that if the alien visited Mars then the robot would visit Jupiter (p \u2192 q), we cannot conclude that the alien definitely visited Mars (p). There could be other reasons for the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, 'The alien visited Mars' does not necessarily follow from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
