            "content": "To determine if 'The doll was plastic' necessarily follows from the given statements, let's analyze the logic:\n\n1. The first statement, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll was plastic, it guarantees that the truck was metal. However, it doesn't say anything about the case when the doll is not plastic.\n\n2. The second statement, 'The truck was metal', confirms that the truck was indeed metal. However, this doesn't provide any information about the material of the doll.\n\n3. From the given statements, we can conclude that either:\n   a) The doll was plastic, and therefore the truck was metal.\n   b) The doll was not plastic, but the truck was still metal due to some other reason.\n\n4. Since both scenarios are possible given the information provided, we cannot say for certain that 'The doll was plastic'.\n\nTherefore, 'The doll was plastic' does not necessarily follow from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
