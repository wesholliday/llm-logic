            "content": "To determine if 'Mary was at the wedding' necessarily follows from the given statements, let's analyze the logic:\n\n1. The first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. It means that if Mary was present, then Sue was definitely present. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary was not present.\n\n2. The second statement, 'Sue was at the wedding', confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then based on the first statement, Sue would have been at the wedding. This is consistent with the second statement.\n   - However, if Mary was not at the wedding, the first statement doesn't provide any information about Sue's presence. Sue could still have been at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\n4. Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding doesn't necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding. Sue's presence could be independent of Mary's presence.\n\nIn conclusion, 'Mary was at the wedding' does not necessarily follow from the given statements. The presence of Sue at the wedding does not guarantee Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no"
