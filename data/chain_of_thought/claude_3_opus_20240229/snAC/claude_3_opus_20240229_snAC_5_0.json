'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is true.\n2. 'Amy played tennis' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'Jeff played basketball' is true, then the consequence 'Amy played tennis' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about what happens if 'Amy played tennis' is true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that 'Amy played tennis' is indeed true. However, this does not give us any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Amy could have played tennis because she enjoys the sport, regardless of whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nIn this scenario, both the given statements are true, but 'Jeff played basketball' is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, just because 'Amy played tennis' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Jeff played basketball' is true. The given statements do not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
