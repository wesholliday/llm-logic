This is because if it's possible that P is not true, then it cannot be necessary that P is true.\n\n5) Therefore, the premise and the conclusion are logically equivalent. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\n6) In a valid argument, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Since the premise and conclusion are equivalent here, this is impossible.\n\n7) Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
