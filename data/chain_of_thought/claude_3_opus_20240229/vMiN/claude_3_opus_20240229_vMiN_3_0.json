In other words, it's not necessarily true that James wrote the book.\n\n2) The conclusion states that it's not necessarily true that James wrote the book.\n\n3) The premise and conclusion are saying essentially the same thing: that it's not certain or necessary that James wrote the book.\n\n4) In logic, an argument is valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise(s). \n\n5) In this case, the conclusion does follow necessarily from the premise. If it's possible that James didn't write the book (premise), then it can't be the case that James must have written the book (conclusion).\n\n6) Therefore, the argument is logically valid. The form of the argument is such that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
