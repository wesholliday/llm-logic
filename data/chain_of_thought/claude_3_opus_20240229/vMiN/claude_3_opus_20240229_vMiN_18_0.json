In modal logic, this can be symbolized as '\u00ac\u25a1p', where '\u25a1' represents necessity, '\u00ac' represents negation, and 'p' represents the proposition 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\n2) The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'. This can be symbolized as '\u00ac\u25a1p' as well.\n\n3) For an argument to be logically valid, the truth of the premises must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In other words, it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4) In this case, the premise and the conclusion are stating the same thing: that it's not necessary that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\n5) If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true, because they are saying the same thing.\n\n6) Therefore, it's impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
