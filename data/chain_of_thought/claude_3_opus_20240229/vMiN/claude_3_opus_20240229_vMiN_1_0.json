            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form:\n   Premise: Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\n2) In modal logic, \"might not\" is equivalent to \"not necessarily\". So the premise can be rephrased as:\n   It's not necessarily the case that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n3) The conclusion is saying:\n   It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n   \n4) \"Must\" in modal logic is equivalent to \"necessarily\". So the conclusion can be rephrased as:\n   It's not the case that Mary was necessarily at the wedding.\n\n5) The rephrased premise and conclusion are:\n   Premise: It's not necessarily the case that Mary was at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: It's not the case that Mary was necessarily at the wedding.\n\n6) These are saying the same thing, just phrased slightly differently. The premise and conclusion are logically equivalent.\n\n7) In a valid argument, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. If the premise and conclusion are saying the same thing, then of course the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, yes, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
