This is because if it's possible that A is not true, then it cannot be necessary that A is true.\n\n4) Therefore, the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent. The argument is taking the premise and restating it in a logically equivalent form as the conclusion.\n\n5) In a valid argument, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Here, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, because they are saying the same thing in different ways.\n\n6) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
