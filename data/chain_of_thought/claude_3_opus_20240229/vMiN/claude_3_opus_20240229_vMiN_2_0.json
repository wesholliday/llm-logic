They are saying the same thing in different ways.\n\n4) In a valid argument, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Here, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true, because they are saying the same thing.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
