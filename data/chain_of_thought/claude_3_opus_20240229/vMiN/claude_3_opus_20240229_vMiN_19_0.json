So the premise can be rephrased as:\n   It's not necessarily the case that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n3) The conclusion is saying:\n   It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n   \n4) \"Must\" in modal logic is equivalent to \"necessarily\". So the conclusion can be rephrased as:\n   It's not the case that the watch is necessarily charging on the dresser.\n\n5) The rephrased premise and conclusion are saying the same thing:\n   Premise: It's not necessarily the case that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n   Conclusion: It's not the case that the watch is necessarily charging on the dresser.\n\n6) If the premise and conclusion are saying the same thing, then the argument is logically valid. The truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
