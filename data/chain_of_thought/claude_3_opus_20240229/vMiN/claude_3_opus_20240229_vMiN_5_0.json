This is because if it's possible that P is not true, then it cannot be necessary that P is true.\n\n4) Therefore, the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent. The argument has the form:\n   Premise: \u25c7(not P)\n   Conclusion: \u25c7(not P)\n\n5) Any argument where the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent is valid, because if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
