This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the tizzer is on\" and Q is \"the goom is snurpled\".\n\n2. The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled\". This is also a conditional statement, but with a compound condition. Let's call the new condition R, where R is \"the tizzer is on and the plink light is out\".\n\n3. The inference would be valid if the truth of R necessarily implies the truth of Q. In other words, if R is a more specific case of P.\n\n4. In this case, R (the tizzer is on and the plink light is out) is indeed a more specific case of P (the tizzer is on). If R is true, then P must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, if the original statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the statement \"If R, then Q\" must also be true, because R implies P.\n\nSo yes, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
