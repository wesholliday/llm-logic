This is because the additional condition R doesn't affect the original implication.\n\nIn other words, if it's true that Q will happen whenever P is true, then Q will still happen when both P and R are true.\n\nTherefore, yes, the inference is valid. If bringling the splotch is sufficient for the bloop to floosh, then the bloop will still floosh if you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted.\n\nAnswer: yes"
