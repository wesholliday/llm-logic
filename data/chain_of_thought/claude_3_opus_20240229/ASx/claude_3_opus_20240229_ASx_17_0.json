In logical terms, this means:\n   \n   glop on brink \u2192 skrizzle plonked\n\n2) The statement we're asked about is \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked\". Logically:\n\n   (glop on brink \u2227 bloop zorped) \u2192 skrizzle plonked  \n\n3) Comparing the two, we see that the second statement has an additional condition (the bloop being zorped) in the antecedent (the \"if\" part). \n\n4) In general, adding conditions to the antecedent of an implication makes the implication easier to satisfy. If P implies Q, then (P and R) will also always imply Q, regardless of what R is.\n\n5) Therefore, if \"glop on brink\" is enough by itself to imply \"skrizzle plonked\", then certainly \"glop on brink and also something else\" will still imply \"skrizzle plonked\".\n\n6) So yes, the second statement does logically follow from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
