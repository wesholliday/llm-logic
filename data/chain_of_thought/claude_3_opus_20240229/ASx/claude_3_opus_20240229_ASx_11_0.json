Adding an extra condition doesn't negate the original implication.\n\nIn other words, if the glorp zoons whenever the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will still zoon if the zibble is zapped and some other condition (the quib being squinked) is also met.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
