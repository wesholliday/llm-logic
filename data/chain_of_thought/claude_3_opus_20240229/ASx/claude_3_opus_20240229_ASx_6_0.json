This means that glurping is a sufficient condition for hurting the snarfs. In other words, glurping alone, regardless of any other conditions, will result in the snarfs being hurt.\n\n2. The proposed inference is \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs\". This statement adds an additional condition (wearing plorks) to the original sufficient condition (glurping).\n\n3. Adding an extra condition to the sufficient condition does not invalidate the original implication. If glurping alone is enough to hurt the snarfs, then glurping while wearing plorks will also hurt the snarfs. The wearing of plorks is irrelevant to the outcome.\n\n4. Therefore, the inference is valid. If the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
