We can't infer from that \"If it rains and the temperature drops below freezing, the ground gets wet\", because the additional condition of the temperature dropping below freezing could prevent the ground from getting wet (since the rain might turn to snow or ice).\n\nSo in this case, just knowing \"If the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked\" does not allow us to infer \"If the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked\". The additional condition of the troon being zibbled could potentially interfere with or prevent the blip being floinked.\n\nAnswer: no"
