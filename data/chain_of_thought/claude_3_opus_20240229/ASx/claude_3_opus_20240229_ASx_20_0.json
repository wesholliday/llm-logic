The original statement is: \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh\". \nThis is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh\".\nThis is also a conditional, but of the form: If P and R, then Q.\n\n3. In logic, if a statement of the form \"If P then Q\" is true, then any statement of the form \"If P and R then Q\" must also be true. This is because the second statement has a more restrictive condition. \n\n4. In other words, if Q is guaranteed to be true whenever P is true, then Q will still be true in the more specific case where both P and R are true.\n\n5. Therefore, given the truth of the original statement, the inference \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
