The original statement is a conditional: If P (the ploofle is blorped), then Q (the fliggle will get a nurple).\n\n2. The question is asking if we can infer a new conditional: If P and Z (the ploofle is blorped and zooned), then Q (the fliggle will get a nurple).\n\n3. Logically, if P is sufficient for Q to occur, then P and any other condition (like Z) will also be sufficient for Q. In other words, adding an extra condition to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) does not invalidate the original implication.\n\n4. Therefore, if \"the ploofle being blorped\" is enough to make \"the fliggle get a nurple\", then certainly \"the ploofle being blorped and zooned\" is also enough.\n\nSo, yes, we can make the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
