It also implies that these are the only two possibilities.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the sock is not under the bed.\n\n4) If the sock is not under the bed, and under the bed and in the laundry basket were the only two possibilities, then the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\n5) This is a valid inference using the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism: if we have \"A or B\", and \"not A\", then we can infer \"B\".\n\nTherefore, yes, from these two statements we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
