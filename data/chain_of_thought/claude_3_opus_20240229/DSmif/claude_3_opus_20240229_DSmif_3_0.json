It states that one of two possibilities must be true: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet, or they are in the drawer.\n\n3) The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the two possible locations for the keys. The only remaining possibility, based on the information given, is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n5) Therefore, if the initial statements are true, we can logically infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
