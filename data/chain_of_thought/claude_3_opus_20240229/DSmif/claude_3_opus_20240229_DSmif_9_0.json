These are the only two options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of those possibilities. It states that the missing piece is not on the floor.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then we have eliminated one of the two possibilities presented in statement (a).\n\n5) The only remaining possibility from statement (a) is that the missing piece is in the box.\n\n6) Therefore, if we take both given statements to be true, we can indeed infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
