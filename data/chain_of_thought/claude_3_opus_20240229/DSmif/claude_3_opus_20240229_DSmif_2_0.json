This means that the book can only be in one of two places: on the table or on the shelf. \n\n2) The second statement says \"The book might not be resting on the table\". This means there's a possibility that the book is not on the table. \n\n3) If the book is not on the table, and we know from the first statement that it can only be either on the table or on the shelf, then it must be on the shelf.\n\n4) However, the second statement doesn't say that the book is definitely not on the table, only that it might not be. So there's still a possibility that the book is on the table.\n\n5) Therefore, we can't say for certain that the book is on the shelf. The most we can say is that it might be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no"
