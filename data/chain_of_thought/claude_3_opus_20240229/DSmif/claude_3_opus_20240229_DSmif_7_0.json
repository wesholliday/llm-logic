It states that one of two things must be true: either the umbrella is in the closet, or it is in the car.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those two possibilities is not true: the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4) If we know that one of the two possibilities in an either/or situation is not true, then the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the umbrella is not in the closet, and we know it must be either in the closet or in the car, then it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
