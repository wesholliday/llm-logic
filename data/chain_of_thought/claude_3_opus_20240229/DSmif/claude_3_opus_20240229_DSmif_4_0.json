It states that one of two things must be true: either the cat is playing in the bedroom, or it's napping on the couch.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that one of those two possibilities is not true: the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\n4) If we know that one part of an either/or statement is false, then the other part must be true. \n\n5) Therefore, if the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, and we know it must be doing one of the two things mentioned in the first statement, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
