In other words, the fribble is either snurgled, or it must be crinked, or both.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the second part of the disjunction in (a). It states that it is not necessary for the fribble to be crinked.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n   - The fribble must be either snurgled or crinked (from (a))\n   - The fribble is not necessarily crinked (from (b))\n   - Therefore, the fribble must be snurgled\n\n5) This is because if the fribble is not crinked, then for the disjunction in (a) to be true, the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
