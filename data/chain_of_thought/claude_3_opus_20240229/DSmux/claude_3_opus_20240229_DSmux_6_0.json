It says that at least one of these two things must be true: either the grommet is sploffed, or the grommet must be plopped.\n\n3) The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the grommet must be plopped.\n\n4) In logic, if we have a disjunction where one part is proven false, then the other part must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\n5) In this case, since \"the grommet must be plopped\" is not true, then for the first statement to be true, \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
