In other words, either \"the sneg is crampled\" is true, or \"the sneg must be sproted\" is true, or both are true.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the second part of the disjunction in (a). It states that \"the sneg must be sproted\" is not true.\n\n4) If we accept both statements as true, then we know from (b) that the second part of the disjunction in (a) is false.\n\n5) But we also know from (a) that at least one part of the disjunction must be true. Since we've determined that the second part is false, the first part must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\n6) Therefore, if we accept both given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
