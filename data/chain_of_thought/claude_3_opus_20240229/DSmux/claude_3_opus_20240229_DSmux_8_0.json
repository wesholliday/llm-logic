It says that one of two things must be true: either the sprocket is cranked, or the sprocket must be daggled.\n\n3) The second statement negates one of those possibilities. It says that it's not true that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n   - We know that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled (from statement 1)\n   - We also know that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (from statement 2)\n   - Therefore, the other possibility presented in statement 1 must be true: the sprocket is cranked.\n\n5) This is a valid inference. If we have an either/or situation, and we know that one of the possibilities is not true, then the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
