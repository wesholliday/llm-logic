In logic, we can represent this as:\n   (F or S), where F = \"the zinger is fraggled\", and S = \"the zinger must be smoogled\"\n   \n2) We are also given \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled\". Logically, this is the negation of S:\n   not S\n   \n3) From (1), we know that at least one of F or S must be true. \n\n4) From (2), we know that S is false.\n\n5) If S is false, and we know from (1) that at least one of F or S must be true, then it must be the case that F is true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
