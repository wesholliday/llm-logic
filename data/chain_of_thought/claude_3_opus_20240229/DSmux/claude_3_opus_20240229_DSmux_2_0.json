It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The wug is flooped\n   - The wug must be bimmed\n\n3) The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It says:\n   - It is not true that the wug must be bimmed\n\n4) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n5) Since we know that \"the wug must be bimmed\" is not true, for the first statement to be true, \"the wug is flooped\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that \"the wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
