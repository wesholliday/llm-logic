It says that at least one of these two things must be true: either the clug is fleeked, or the clug must be snugged.\n\n3) The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the clug must be snugged.\n\n4) In logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q), and we know that one part of the disjunction is false (not Q), then we can infer that the other part must be true (P).\n\n5) Applying this to our statements:\n   - P: \"the clug is fleeked\"\n   - Q: \"the clug must be snugged\"\n   - We know \"not Q\" is true\n\n6) Therefore, since we have \"P or Q\" and \"not Q\", we can infer that \"P\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
