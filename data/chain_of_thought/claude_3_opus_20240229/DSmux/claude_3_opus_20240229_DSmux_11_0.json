These are the only two options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities is not true. Specifically, it's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\n4) So, if we know that the flug is not in the state of \"must be zimmed\", and we know that it's either in the state of \"is blummed\" or \"must be zimmed\", then the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
