It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The flugel is blimmed\n   - The flugel must be zargled\n\n3) The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It says:\n   - It is not true that the flugel must be zargled\n\n4) If we accept both of these statements as true, then we can conclude:\n   - The second part of the disjunction (\"the flugel must be zargled\") is false.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, if \"the flugel must be zargled\" is false, then \"the flugel is blimmed\" must be true, given that we accept the initial disjunction as true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
