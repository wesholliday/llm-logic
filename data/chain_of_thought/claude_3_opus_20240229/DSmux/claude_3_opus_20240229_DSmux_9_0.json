In other words, either the twonk is varnished, or the twonk must be plinked, or both.\n\n3) Statement (b) negates the second part of the disjunction in (a). It states that it is not true that the twonk must be plinked.\n\n4) If we combine the information from (a) and (b), we can reason as follows:\n   - From (a), we know that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\n   - But from (b), we know that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n   - Therefore, the second part of the disjunction in (a) is false.\n\n5) In a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n6) Therefore, since the second part (\"the twonk must be plinked\") is false, the first part (\"the twonk is varnished\") must be true.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
