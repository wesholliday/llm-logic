It says that at least one of these two things must be true: either the smonk is vreebled, or the smonk must be plagged.\n\n3) The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It says that it's not true that the smonk must be plagged.\n\n4) If we know that one part of a disjunction is false, then for the disjunction to be true (as the first statement claims), the other part must be true.\n\n5) In this case, since \"the smonk must be plagged\" is not true, then for the first statement to be true, \"the smonk is vreebled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, from these two statements, we can infer that \"the smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
