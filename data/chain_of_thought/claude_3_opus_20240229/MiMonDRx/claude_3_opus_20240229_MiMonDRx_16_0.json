            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wobble might be snorkel\" tells us that \"wobble\" could potentially be \"snorkel\". It does not provide any information about whether \"wobble\" could also be \"shimble\".\n\nIn propositional logic, if we are told that A might be B, we cannot infer that A might be C or B, because the \"or\" introduces the possibility of A being something (C) that was not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nTo infer \"The wobble might be shimble or snorkel\" from the original statement would be adding information that is not provided or logically implied. We would need additional information to draw that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
