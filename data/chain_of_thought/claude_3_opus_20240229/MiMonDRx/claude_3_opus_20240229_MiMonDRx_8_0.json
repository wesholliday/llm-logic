However, it does not provide any information about whether the quank might also be wozzle. \n\nTo infer \"The quank might be wozzle or quorple\" from the original statement, we would need additional information indicating that wozzle is also a possibility for the quank. Without this information, we cannot logically make the inference that the quank might be either wozzle or quorple based solely on the statement that it might be quorple.\n\nTherefore, given only the information provided in the original statement, we do not have sufficient evidence to infer that \"The quank might be wozzle or quorple\".\n\nAnswer: no"
