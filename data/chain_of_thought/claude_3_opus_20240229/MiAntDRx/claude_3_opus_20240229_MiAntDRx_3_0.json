The original statement says \"The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble\". This means there are two possible locations for the fribble: either in the blurble, or on the wumble. Since \"on the wumble\" is explicitly stated as one of the two possibilities, we can logically conclude that the fribble might indeed be located on the wumble, based solely on the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
