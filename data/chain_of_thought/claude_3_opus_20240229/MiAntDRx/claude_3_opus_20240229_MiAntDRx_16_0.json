            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wibble might be wumble shimble or blurble wobble\" presents two possibilities for what the wibble might be: either \"wumble shimble\" or \"blurble wobble\". The statement \"The wibble might be blurble wobble\" only presents one of those two possibilities. Since the original statement allows for the wibble to be either \"wumble shimble\" or \"blurble wobble\", it logically follows that the wibble might indeed be \"blurble wobble\", as that is one of the two explicitly stated possibilities. Therefore, we can correctly infer \"The wibble might be blurble wobble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
