This is a stronger claim than the original statement.\n\nThe original statement allows for the possibility that we don't know for certain which day the meeting was on, just that it was one of those two days. But the proposed inference eliminates that uncertainty and claims definitiveness for each day individually.\n\nSince the inference is making a claim that's stronger than what the original statement justifies, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
