            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" means that the package was definitely delivered, and the delivery was made either by truck or by plane. However, this does not necessarily mean that the package must have been delivered by truck or that it must have been delivered by plane.\n\nFor example, if the package was delivered by truck, then it is not true that it must have been delivered by plane. Similarly, if it was delivered by plane, then it is not true that it must have been delivered by truck.\n\nThe phrase \"must have been\" in the original statement applies to the entire disjunction (truck or plane), not to each individual part separately. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered by truck or that it must have been delivered by plane.\n\nAnswer: no"
