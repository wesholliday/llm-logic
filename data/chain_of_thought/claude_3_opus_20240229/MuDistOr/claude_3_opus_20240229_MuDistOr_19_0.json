            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or relevant work experience\" uses the logical operator \"or\". In logic, the \"or\" operator is inclusive, meaning that for the statement to be true, at least one of the conditions must be met, but both conditions could also be true.\n\nWhen we rephrase the statement as \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\", we are essentially stating the same thing. The candidate is required to have either a degree, relevant work experience, or both.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement conveys the same meaning as the original statement, and we can indeed infer the rephrased statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
