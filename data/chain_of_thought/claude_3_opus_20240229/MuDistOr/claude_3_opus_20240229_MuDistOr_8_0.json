            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" uses the logical operator \"or\". In propositional logic, the \"or\" operator is inclusive, meaning that it allows for one, the other, or both conditions to be true for the overall statement to be true.\n\nWhen we say \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\", we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate conditions:\n1. The document must have been signed.\n2. The document must have been notarized.\n\nThe use of \"or\" in the rephrased statement maintains the inclusive nature of the original statement. It means that for the document to be valid, it must satisfy at least one of the two conditions - either it must have been signed, or it must have been notarized, or both.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
