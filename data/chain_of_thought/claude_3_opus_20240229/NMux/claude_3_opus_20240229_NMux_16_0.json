In other words, there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\n2. \"The sneg might not have been crampled\" means that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\n3. If it is not necessarily true that the sneg was crampled (as stated in the first sentence), then it follows that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled (as stated in the second sentence).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sneg might not have been crampled\" from \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
