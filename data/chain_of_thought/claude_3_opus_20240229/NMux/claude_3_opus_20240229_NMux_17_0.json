There's a possibility it wasn't skizzled.\n3) The statement we're trying to infer is \"The flob might not have been skizzled\".\n4) \"Might not have been\" means there's a possibility it wasn't the case. \n5) This lines up with the original statement - if it's not necessarily true that it was skizzled, then there's a possibility it wasn't skizzled.\n6) Therefore, the inference \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" logically follows from and is consistent with the original statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
