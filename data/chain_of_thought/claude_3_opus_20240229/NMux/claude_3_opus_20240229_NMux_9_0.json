'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked' means that it is not necessarily true that the twonk was plinked. In other words, there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked.\n\n2. 'The twonk might not have been plinked' also suggests that there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked.\n\n3. Both statements convey the same idea: it is possible that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The twonk might not have been plinked' from 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
