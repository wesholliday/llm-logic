            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The truck was metal\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, this conditional statement does not say anything about what happens if the truck was metal. It does not state that the doll must be plastic if the truck is metal.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that \"the truck was metal\" is indeed true.\n\n5) But just because the consequence of the conditional statement is true, we cannot conclude that the condition must also be true. This is because there could be other reasons why the truck was metal, apart from the doll being plastic.\n\n6) In other words, the truth of the consequence does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition in a conditional statement. This is a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\n7) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot deduce that \"the doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: no"
