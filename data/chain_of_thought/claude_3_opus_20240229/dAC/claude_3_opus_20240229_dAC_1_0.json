            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if Mary was there, Sue must have been there too.\n\n3) However, the converse is not necessarily true. The statement does not say anything about what happens if Sue was at the wedding. Mary may or may not have been there.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that the necessary condition for Mary being at the wedding (Sue being at the wedding) is satisfied. \n\n5) But just because the necessary condition is satisfied doesn't mean the sufficient condition (Mary being at the wedding) must be true. Sue could have been at the wedding without Mary.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot deduce from these statements that Mary was definitely at the wedding. The information given is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
