It states that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain consequence follows (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n3) However, the converse of this statement (if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James) is not necessarily true. There could be mystery novels written by other authors.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that the consequence of the conditional (the book is a mystery novel) is true. \n\n5) But just because the consequence is true, we can't assume that the condition (the book was written by James) is also true. That would be affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot deduce from these two statements alone that the book was written by James. It's possible that it was, but it's not a logically valid deduction.\n\nAnswer: no"
