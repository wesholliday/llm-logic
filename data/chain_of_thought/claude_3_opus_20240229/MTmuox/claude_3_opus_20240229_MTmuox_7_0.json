It states that if the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" is true, then the consequence \"the whiffle must have tinked\" must also be true.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n5) From the first statement, we know that it's possible that the whiffle did not tink. \n\n6) If the whiffle was shanked, then according to the second statement, it must have tinked. But we know from the first statement that it's possible it didn't tink.\n\n7) Therefore, for both statements to be true simultaneously, it must be the case that the whiffle was not shanked. If it was shanked, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
