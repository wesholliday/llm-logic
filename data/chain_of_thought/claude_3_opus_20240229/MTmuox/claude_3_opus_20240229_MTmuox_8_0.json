            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n2) The first statement can be rephrased as:\n   - \"It is possible that the sprocket was not daggled\"\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for the sprocket being daggled. In other words, if the sprocket was cranked, it guarantees that it was daggled.\n\n4) We are asked if we can infer from these statements that \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\n5) From the first statement, we know that it's possible the sprocket was not daggled. But the second statement tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled.\n\n6) So, if the sprocket was not daggled (which we know is possible from the first statement), then it could not have been cranked, because if it were cranked, it would have to have been daggled (according to the second statement).\n\n7) Therefore, yes, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked. If it had been cranked, it would contradict the possibility of it not being daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
