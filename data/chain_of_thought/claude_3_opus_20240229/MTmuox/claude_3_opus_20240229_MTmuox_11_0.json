But the first statement says the flug might not have been zimmed.\n\n6) So if the flug was blummed, we would have a contradiction: the flug must have been zimmed (from statement 2) and the flug might not have been zimmed (from statement 1).\n\n7) To avoid this contradiction, it must be the case that the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
