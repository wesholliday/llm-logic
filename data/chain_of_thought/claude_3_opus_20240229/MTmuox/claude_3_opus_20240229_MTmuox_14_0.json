            "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\"\n   - \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"\n\n2) The first statement can be rephrased as:\n   - \"The clug was not necessarily snugged\"\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, then the consequence \"the clug must have been snugged\" is also true.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\n5) From the first statement, we know that the clug was not necessarily snugged. But the second statement tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\n6) So, if the clug was fleeked, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement. The only way to avoid this contradiction is if the clug was not fleeked.\n\n7) Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
