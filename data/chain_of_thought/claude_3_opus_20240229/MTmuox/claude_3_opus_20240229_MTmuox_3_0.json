It states that morphing is a sufficient condition for quanking. In other words, if the splat was morphed, it necessarily quanked.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\n5) From the second statement, we know that if the splat was morphed, it must have quanked. But the first statement tells us that it's possible the splat did not quank.\n\n6) If the splat did not quank (which is possible according to the first statement), and morphing necessarily leads to quanking (according to the second statement), then it follows that the splat could not have been morphed.\n\n7) Therefore, yes, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
