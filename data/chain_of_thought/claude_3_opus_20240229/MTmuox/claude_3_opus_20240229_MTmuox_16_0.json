In other words, it's possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: if A (the sneg was crampled), then B (the sneg must have sproted the frink).\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\n5) Let's assume the opposite, that the sneg was crampled. If the sneg was crampled, then according to the second statement, the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\n6) But this contradicts the first statement, which says it's possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n7) Therefore, our assumption that the sneg was crampled must be false. If it were true, it would lead to a contradiction.\n\n8) So, we can indeed infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
