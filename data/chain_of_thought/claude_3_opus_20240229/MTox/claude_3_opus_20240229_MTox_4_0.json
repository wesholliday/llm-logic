We are also told that \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\". This is a conditional statement. It means that snurgling the fribble is sufficient for the fribble to crink. \n\n3. Now, we know the fribble did not crink. If the fribble had been snurgled, then according to the conditional statement, it would have crinked. But it didn't crink.\n\n4. Therefore, it could not have been the case that the fribble was snurgled. If it had been snurgled, it would have crinked, contradicting the fact that it did not crink.\n\n5. Thus, from the two given statements, we can indeed conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
