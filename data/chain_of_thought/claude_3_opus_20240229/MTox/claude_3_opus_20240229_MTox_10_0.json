            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The wug was not garpled\"\n   - \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" is true, then the consequence \"it was garpled\" must also be true.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the contrapositive of this conditional statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it reverses and negates both parts of the conditional. So the contrapositive would be:\n   - \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged\"\n\n4) Now we can use modus ponens, a rule of inference which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) We know from the first given statement that \"The wug was not garpled\". This matches the antecedent of the contrapositive statement from step 3.\n\n6) Therefore, by modus ponens, we can infer that the consequent of the contrapositive statement must also be true: \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
