It states that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\n3) Now, we also know from the first statement that \"The fleeg did not surn\". In other words, the consequence \"it surned\" is false.\n\n4) In a conditional, if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional would be false, which it isn't according to the given information.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"it surned\" is false, \"the fleeg was bluttered\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
