We are given two statements:\n   - \"The splat did not quank\"\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It tells us that if the splat was morphed, it must have quanked. \n\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the splat did not in fact quank.\n\n4. Therefore, the condition in the second statement (the splat being morphed) must not have been met. If it had been met, the splat would have quanked, contradicting the first statement.\n\n5. Thus, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed. If it had been morphed, it would have quanked, but we know it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes"
