            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sprocket was not daggled\"\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true, then it necessarily follows that \"the sprocket was daggled\" is also true.\n\n3) However, we are told in the first statement that \"the sprocket was not daggled\". This directly contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\n4) If the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then its condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be invalid.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the sprocket was daggled\" is false, \"the sprocket was cranked\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
