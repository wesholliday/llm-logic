            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\"\n   - \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2) The first statement directly tells us that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is true, then the consequence \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true.\n\n4) However, we know from the first statement that \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is false.\n\n5) In logic, if a conditional statement is true, and its consequence is false, then its condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false.\n\n6) Therefore, since the consequence \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is false, and the conditional statement is assumed to be true, the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" must be false.\n\n7) In other words, the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
