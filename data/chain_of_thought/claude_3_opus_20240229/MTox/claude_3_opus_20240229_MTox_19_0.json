It states that if the condition \"the smonk was vreebled\" is true, then the consequence \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n\n3) Now, from the first statement, we know that \"the smonk did not plagged\". In other words, the consequence of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\n5) Applying this rule to our problem:\n   - The conditional \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The consequence \"the smonk plagged\" is false (because \"the smonk did not plagged\").\n   - Therefore, the condition \"the smonk was vreebled\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
