It states that if the condition \"the glip was slogged\" is true, then the consequence \"the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, we know from the first statement that \"the glip was not tragged\". This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n4) If the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Otherwise, the conditional statement would be false, which it is not in this case.\n\n5) Therefore, since \"the glip was tragged\" is false, \"the glip was slogged\" must also be false.\n\n6) In other words, we can indeed infer that \"the glip was not slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
