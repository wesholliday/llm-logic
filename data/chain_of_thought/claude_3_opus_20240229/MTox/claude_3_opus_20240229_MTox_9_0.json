We are given two statements:\n   - \"The twonk was not varnished\"\n   - \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It says that if the twonk was plinked, it necessarily follows that it was varnished. \n\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the twonk was not varnished.\n\n4. If the twonk was plinked, the second statement would imply it was varnished. But this contradicts the first statement.\n\n5. Therefore, for both statements to be true, it must be the case that the twonk was not plinked. If it was plinked, we would have a contradiction.\n\nSo yes, from these two statements, we can logically infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
