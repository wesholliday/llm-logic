            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is more specific than \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\". If we know that the restaurant must have been closed on Mondays, then it logically follows that the restaurant was either closed or had limited hours on Mondays. The original statement is a stronger claim that directly supports the broader statement. In other words, the first statement entails the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
