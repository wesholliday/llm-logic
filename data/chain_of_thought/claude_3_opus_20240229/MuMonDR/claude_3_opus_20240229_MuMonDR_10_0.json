            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized or signed' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n'The document must have been signed' indicates that signing the document is a necessary condition. In other words, it is not possible for the document to be valid without being signed.\n\nThe statement 'The document must have been notarized or signed' introduces an additional possibility - that the document could have been notarized instead of being signed. Notarization is a separate process from signing, typically involving a notary public who verifies the identity of the person signing the document and witnesses the signature.\n\nIf we know that the document must have been signed, it does not necessarily mean that it must have been notarized as well. Signing is sufficient to fulfill the condition stated in the first statement, and notarization is not required.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The document must have been notarized or signed' from 'The document must have been signed' because the latter does not imply the former.\n\nAnswer: no"
