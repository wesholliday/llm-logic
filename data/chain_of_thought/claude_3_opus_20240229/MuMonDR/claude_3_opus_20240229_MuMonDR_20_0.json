            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal' from 'The event must have been formal', we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\n'The event must have been formal' is a definitive statement that the event was formal. This means that the event cannot be anything other than formal.\n\nThe statement 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal' allows for two possibilities: the event being either semi-formal or formal.\n\nSince 'The event must have been formal' already establishes that the event was definitely formal, it automatically satisfies the condition of 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal'. In other words, if an event is formal, it is also true that it is either semi-formal or formal, because 'formal' is one of the options in the 'semi-formal or formal' statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal' from 'The event must have been formal'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
