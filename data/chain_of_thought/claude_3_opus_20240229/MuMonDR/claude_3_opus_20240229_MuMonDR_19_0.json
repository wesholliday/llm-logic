            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application must have been completed online\" means that completing the application online was a necessary condition or requirement. In other words, there was no other way to complete the application except online.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The application must have been completed in person or online\" introduces an alternative possibility of completing the application in person. However, this directly contradicts the original statement which specifies that the application must have been completed online, implying that in-person completion was not an option.\n\nSince the proposed inference contradicts the given information by introducing an additional possibility that was explicitly ruled out, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement from the given one.\n\nAnswer: no"
