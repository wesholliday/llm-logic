            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically:\n1) The first statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" indicates that the package was definitely delivered today, and not any other day. \n2) The second statement \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today\" is saying the package was either delivered today or will be delivered tomorrow.\n3) If the package was definitely delivered today (as per the first statement), then it logically follows that it was delivered either today or tomorrow, because 'today' is included in 'today or tomorrow'. \n4) In other words, if we know for certain that the event happened today, then it must be true that it happened either today or tomorrow, since 'today' is a subset of 'today or tomorrow'.\n5) Therefore, from the first statement, we can indeed infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
