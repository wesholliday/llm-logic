            "content": "Explanation: Let's think about this step by step:\n\n1) The original statement is \"The room must have been cleaned daily\". This means that cleaning the room daily was a requirement or a certainty.\n\n2) The proposed inference is \"The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily\". This means that cleaning the room was a requirement or a certainty, and it was done either when requested or daily.\n\n3) The original statement is more specific than the proposed inference. The original statement says that daily cleaning was a must, while the proposed inference says that cleaning was a must, and it could have been daily or upon request.\n\n4) If the room must have been cleaned daily, then it is necessarily true that the room must have been cleaned daily or upon request, because \"daily\" is one of the options in \"daily or upon request\".\n\n5) Therefore, the proposed inference follows logically from the original statement. If we know that the room must have been cleaned daily, then we can infer that the room must have been cleaned daily or upon request.\n\nAnswer: yes"
