            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English\" means that the movie was definitely in English. If a movie is in English, then it is either not subtitled (if the viewer understands English) or it may have subtitles in another language (for non-English speaking viewers). However, the key point is that if we know the movie was in English, then it is necessarily true that the movie was either subtitled or in English, because being in English is one of those two options. Therefore, from the given statement, we can logically infer that \"The movie must have been subtitled or in English\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
