            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" presents two possibilities: the package being delivered today, or the package being delivered tomorrow. The word \"or\" here is being used in an inclusive sense, meaning one or both of the possibilities could be true.\n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The package might be delivered today,\" we are focusing on only one of those two possibilities presented in the original statement. Since the original statement allows for the package to be delivered today as one of the possible outcomes, it is valid to infer that \"The package might be delivered today.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the word \"might\" introduces uncertainty. The package is not guaranteed to be delivered today, but there is a possibility that it could be. This uncertainty is maintained when we infer the smaller statement from the larger one.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can logically infer that \"The package might be delivered today.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
