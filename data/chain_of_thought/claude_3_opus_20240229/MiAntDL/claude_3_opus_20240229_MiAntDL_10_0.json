            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" presents two possibilities: the document being signed, or the document being notarized. These possibilities are connected by the word \"or\", which in logic is an inclusive OR, meaning one or both of the possibilities can be true.\n\nIf a document is notarized, it is also typically signed. However, a document can be signed without being notarized. Therefore, if we know that the document might be either signed or notarized, we can logically infer that the document might be signed, because that possibility is directly stated in the original statement.\n\nThe original statement allows for the document to be signed, notarized, or both. So, it is valid to infer that the document might be signed, as this is one of the explicit possibilities given.\n\nAnswer: yes"
