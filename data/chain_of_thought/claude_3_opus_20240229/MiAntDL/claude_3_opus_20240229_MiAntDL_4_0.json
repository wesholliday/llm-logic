            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting will take place at 2 PM, or it will be cancelled. The statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" is one of these two possibilities.\n\nIn logic, when a statement presents an \"or\" condition between two possibilities, if one of those possibilities is true, the entire statement is considered true. This is known as the \"disjunction\" or \"logical OR\" rule.\n\nTherefore, if we consider the possibility that \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" as a standalone statement, it is indeed a valid inference from the original statement. The original statement allows for the meeting to be at 2 PM, so stating that \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" is logically consistent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
