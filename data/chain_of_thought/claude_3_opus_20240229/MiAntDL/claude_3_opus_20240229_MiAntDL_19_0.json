            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" presents two possible ways of completing the application: online or in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that either of these options is possible.\n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The application might be completed online,\" we are focusing on only one of the two possibilities presented in the original statement. Since the original statement clearly states that completing the application online is a possible option, we can logically infer that \"The application might be completed online\" is true.\n\nIt's important to note that the word \"might\" in both statements suggests that completing the application online is a possibility, but not a certainty. The original statement also allows for the possibility of completing the application in person.\n\nAnswer: yes"
