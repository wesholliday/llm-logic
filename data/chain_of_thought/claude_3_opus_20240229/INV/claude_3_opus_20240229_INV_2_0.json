            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement.\n\n3) In general, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is not logically equivalent to \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\n4) To see why, consider an example: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This does not necessarily mean that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original statement, even if the griffin was not in the forest, the unicorn could still have been in the forest for some other reason unrelated to the griffin.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
