            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\", or in this case, \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\".\n\n3) However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true. Just because P implies Q, it doesn't necessarily mean that not P implies not Q.\n\n4) For example, even if the shirt was not cotton, the pants could still be denim. The material of the pants doesn't necessarily depend on the material of the shirt.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
