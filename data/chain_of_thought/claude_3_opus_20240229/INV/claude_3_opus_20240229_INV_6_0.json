            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" from \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\", let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. The original statement, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\", can be represented as:\n   Sue chose pizza (p) \u2192 Bob chose pasta (q)\n\n2. The statement we want to infer, \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\", can be represented as:\n   Sue did not choose pizza (not p) \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta (not q)\n\n3. In propositional logic, the statement \"If not p, then not q\" is called the inverse of the original statement \"If p, then q\".\n\n4. However, the inverse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if a statement is true, its inverse is not necessarily true.\n\n5. Consider a counterexample:\n   - If it is raining (p), then the ground is wet (q).\n   - The inverse would be: If it is not raining (not p), then the ground is not wet (not q).\n   - However, the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a recent rain, even if it is not currently raining.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" solely based on the given statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n\nAnswer: no"
