            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". \n   This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n   Here, P is \"the book was written by James\", and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\". \n   This is of the form: If not P, then not Q.\n\n3) In general, \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". \n   For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". \n   This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler.\n\n4) Similarly, in our case, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" does not necessarily imply \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\". \n   It's possible that the book is a mystery novel written by someone other than James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
