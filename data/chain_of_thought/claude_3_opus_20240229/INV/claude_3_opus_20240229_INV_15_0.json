This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original statement, Erin could have taken a train for a reason other than Sam taking a plane. \n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
