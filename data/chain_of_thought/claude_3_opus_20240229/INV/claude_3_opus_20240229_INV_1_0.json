            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". \n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be:\n   \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\"\n   This is of the form \"If not P, then not Q\"\n\n3) In general, a conditional statement does not imply its inverse. \n   For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" does not imply \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n4) In this specific case, the original statement tells us nothing about what happens if Mary was not at the wedding. Sue could still have been at the wedding even if Mary wasn't.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: no"
