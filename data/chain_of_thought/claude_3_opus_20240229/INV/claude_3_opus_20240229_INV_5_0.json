            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement.\n\n3) In general, the statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\n4) To see why, consider an example: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in the given statement, it's possible that Amy played tennis for a reason other than Jeff playing basketball. Maybe she just enjoys tennis.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
