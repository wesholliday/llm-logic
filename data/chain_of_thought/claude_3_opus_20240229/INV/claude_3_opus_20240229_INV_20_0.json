            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is a conditional: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\n2) What we're being asked is whether we can infer the inverse of this conditional. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n3) In general, a conditional and its inverse are not logically equivalent. That is, \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily imply \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n4) For example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". This does not necessarily mean that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in our apple and banana example, just because the apple not being red means we can't conclude anything about the banana from the original statement, it doesn't necessarily mean the banana is not yellow. The banana's color could be independent of the apple's color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
