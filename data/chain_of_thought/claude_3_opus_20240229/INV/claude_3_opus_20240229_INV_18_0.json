            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". \n   This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n   Here, P is \"the doll was plastic\", and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\".\n   This is of the form: If not P, then not Q.\n\n3) In general, the statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". \n   This is a common logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent.\n\n4) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\".\n   This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in our original statement, even if the doll is not plastic, the truck could still be metal for some other reason unrelated to the doll.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the statement in question from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
