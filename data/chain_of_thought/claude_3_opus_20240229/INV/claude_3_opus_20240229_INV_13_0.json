            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". In logic, this is called a conditional statement. It means that if the condition \"the car was red\" is true, then it necessarily follows that \"the truck was blue\" is also true.\n\n2) However, the statement does not say anything about what color the truck is if the car is not red. The truck could still be blue, or it could be any other color.\n\n3) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of the original statement. The inverse switches the \"if\" and \"then\" parts of the statement and negates both parts. So the inverse would be \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\".\n\n4) But the truth of a statement does not necessarily imply the truth of its inverse. Just because it's true that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", it doesn't necessarily follow that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\".\n\n5) For example, consider this scenario: The car is green, and the truck is blue. This scenario does not contradict the original statement (because the original statement doesn't say anything about green cars), but it does contradict the inverse statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
