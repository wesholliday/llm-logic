            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n   Q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be:\n   \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n   This is of the form \"If not P, then not Q\"\n\n3) In general, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n   That is, \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily imply \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n4) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\".\n   The inverse would be: \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\".\n   But this inverse statement is not necessarily true, because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like if a sprinkler was on.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original statement about Lisa and Mark, just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. \n   Mark's purchase of the blue shirt might not depend on Lisa's purchase of the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
