            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement.\n\n3) In general, the statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\n4) To see why, consider an example: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This does not imply that \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original statement, Lucy could have gone to the zoo regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not. The original statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy definitely went to the zoo. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
