            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". In logic, this is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\", or in this case, \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\".\n\n3) However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true. Consider this example: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". This is true, but its inverse, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\", is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler).\n\n4) Similarly, in the original statement, it's possible that the mummy could be awake for reasons other than the vampire being awake. The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
