It states that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that \"Joe went to the park\" is indeed true.\n\n4) Therefore, the condition of the second statement is met.\n\n5) When the condition of an if-then statement is true, the consequence must also be true.\n\n6) Thus, we can conclude that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
