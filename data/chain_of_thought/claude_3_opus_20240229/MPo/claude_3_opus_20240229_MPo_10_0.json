We can take it as true.\n\n3) The second statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\", is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the dog was inside\" is true, then the consequence \"the cat was outside\" must also be true.\n\n4) Now, we know from the first statement that the condition \"the dog was inside\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the consequence \"the cat was outside\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The cat was outside\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
