            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The shirt was cotton\"\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n\n2) The first statement is a simple assertion: it states that the shirt was indeed cotton.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is true, then the conclusion \"the pants were denim\" must also be true.\n\n4) We know from the first statement that the condition \"the shirt was cotton\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, based on the second statement, the conclusion \"the pants were denim\" must also be true.\n\n6) This is a valid inference. If the premises are true (which they are given to be), then the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
