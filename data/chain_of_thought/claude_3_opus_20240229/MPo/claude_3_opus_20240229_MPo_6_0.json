It states that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that \"Sue chose pizza\" is indeed true.\n\n4) Therefore, the condition of the second statement is met.\n\n5) When the condition of an if-then statement is true, the consequence must also be true.\n\n6) Thus, we can conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
