It states that if the first part (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the second part (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that \"the alien visited Mars\" is indeed true.\n\n4) Therefore, the condition in the second statement is met. \n\n5) So, according to the second statement, \"the robot visited Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\n6) Thus, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
