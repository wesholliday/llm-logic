Let's call this statement P.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the griffin was in the forest (P), then the unicorn was in the forest (let's call this Q). In logical notation, this could be written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n4) Now, we have established that P is true (the griffin was in the forest). \n\n5) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we also know that the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\n6) Applying Modus Ponens here: \n   - We have: P \u2192 Q\n   - We know: P is true\n   - Therefore, we can infer: Q is true\n\n7) In this case, Q is the statement \"The unicorn was in the forest\".\n\nTherefore, yes, from the given statements, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
