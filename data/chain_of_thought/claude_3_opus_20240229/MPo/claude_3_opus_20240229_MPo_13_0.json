We can take this as a fact.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the car was red\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck was blue\" must also be true.\n\n4) We have established from the first statement that the condition \"the car was red\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the conditional in the second statement, the conclusion \"the truck was blue\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
