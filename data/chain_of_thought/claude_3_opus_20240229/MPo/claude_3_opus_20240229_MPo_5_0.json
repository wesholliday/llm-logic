This is a simple fact.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\n4) We know from the first statement that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the conditional in the second statement, the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
