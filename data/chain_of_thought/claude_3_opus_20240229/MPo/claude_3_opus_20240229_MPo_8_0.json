            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"The vampire was awake\" \n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the vampire was definitely awake. \n\n3. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It says that if the first part is true (the vampire was awake), then the second part must also be true (the mummy was awake).\n\n4. We already know from statement 1 that the vampire was indeed awake. \n\n5. Therefore, based on the conditional in statement 2, we can conclude that the mummy must have also been awake.\n\n6. So yes, from the two given statements, we can logically infer that \"The mummy was awake\".\n\nThis type of reasoning is known as modus ponens in logic - if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
