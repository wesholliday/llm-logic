We are given two statements:\n   - \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Since the condition in the second statement is satisfied (Mary was at the wedding), we can conclude that the consequence must also hold true (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n5. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
