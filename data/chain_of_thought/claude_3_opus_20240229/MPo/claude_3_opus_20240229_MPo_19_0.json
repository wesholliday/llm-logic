We are given two statements:\n   - \"Tom watched football\"\n   - \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple assertion: Tom did in fact watch football.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\n4. We know from the first statement that the condition \"Tom watched football\" is indeed true.\n\n5. Therefore, according to the conditional in the second statement, the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nSo, we can infer that \"Jen watched basketball\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
