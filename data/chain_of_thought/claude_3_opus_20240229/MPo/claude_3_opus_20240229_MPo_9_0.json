            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The first statement is a simple assertion. It tells us that Lisa did in fact buy the red shirt.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It says that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n4) We know from statement 1 that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the conditional in statement 2, the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
