It states that if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, then the consequence \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that \"Alex finished the race\" is indeed true.\n\n4) Therefore, the condition of the second statement is met.\n\n5) When the condition of an if-then statement is true, the consequence must also be true.\n\n6) Thus, we can conclude that \"Chris finished the race\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
