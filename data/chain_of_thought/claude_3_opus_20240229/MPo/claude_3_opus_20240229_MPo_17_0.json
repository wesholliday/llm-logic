We can take it as true.\n\n3) The second statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n\n4) We have established that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true from the first statement.\n\n5) Therefore, the condition in the second statement is met. \n\n6) When the condition of an if-then statement is met, we can infer that the consequence must also be true.\n\n7) Therefore, we can infer that \"Kate ate the salad\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
