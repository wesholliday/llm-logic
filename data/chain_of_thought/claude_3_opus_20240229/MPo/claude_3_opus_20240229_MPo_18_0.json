We can take this as a fact.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n4) We know from the first statement that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the conditional in the second statement, the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
