            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"The apple was red\"\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\n2) The first statement is a simple assertion: it states that the apple was red. We can take this as a true fact for the purposes of the inference.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, then the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\n4) We have established from the first statement that \"the apple was red\" is indeed true.\n\n5) Therefore, the condition of the second statement is met. \n\n6) When the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is true, the consequence must also be true. That's the nature of the \"if-then\" logical connection.\n\n7) Therefore, we can conclude that \"the banana was yellow\" must be true, based on the truth of \"the apple was red\" and the logical connection stated in \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
