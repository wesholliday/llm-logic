We can take it as a fact.\n\n3) The second statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\", is a conditional statement. It states that if a certain condition is met (the bear being in the cave), then a certain consequence follows (the wolf being in the den).\n\n4) Now, we know from the first statement that the condition in the second statement is indeed met: the bear was in the cave.\n\n5) Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the consequence must also be true: the wolf was in the den.\n\n6) So, from the two given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The wolf was in the den\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
