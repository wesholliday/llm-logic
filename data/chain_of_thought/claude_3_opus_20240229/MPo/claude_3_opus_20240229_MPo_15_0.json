It states that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is indeed true.\n\n4) Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\n5) So, from the given statements, we can infer that \"Erin took a train\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
