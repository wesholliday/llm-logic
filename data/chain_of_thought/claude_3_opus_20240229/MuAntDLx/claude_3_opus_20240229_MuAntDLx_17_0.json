It does not specify that the frazzle must be frazzle. The frazzle could be gribble and the original statement would still be true. Therefore, we cannot logically infer from the original statement that \"The frazzle must be frazzle\", because there is the alternative possibility that the frazzle is gribble.\n\nAnswer: no"
