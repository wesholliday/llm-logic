It could either be \"quibble flump\" or \"flimble frozz\". \n\nWhen asking if we can infer that \"The frazzle must be quibble flump\", we are essentially asking if this is the only possibility, ruling out \"flimble frozz\".\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that \"quibble flump\" is the only option. It clearly states that the frazzle could be either \"quibble flump\" or \"flimble frozz\". Without additional context or information to rule out \"flimble frozz\", we cannot logically infer that the frazzle must be \"quibble flump\".\n\nAnswer: no"
