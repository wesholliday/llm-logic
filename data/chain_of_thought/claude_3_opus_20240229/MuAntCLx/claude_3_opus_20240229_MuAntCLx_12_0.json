We cannot logically infer additional properties or requirements for the grooble beyond what is explicitly stated in the original sentence. The proposed inference \"The grooble must be grazzle by grooble and be wozzle flump\" adds an extra condition that is not supported by the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
