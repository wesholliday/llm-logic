The original statement only asserts that the gronk must have the property of being quazzle wump. It says nothing about the gronk needing to be blimple for. Adding 'and blimple for' to the statement introduces new information that is not supported by the original premise. We can only infer things that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
