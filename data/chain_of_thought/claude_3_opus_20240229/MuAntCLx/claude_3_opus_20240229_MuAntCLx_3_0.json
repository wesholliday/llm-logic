The given statement only tells us that the snorkel must be in the wumble, but it does not provide any information about the quimble quibble. Adding \"and quimble quibble\" to the conclusion introduces new information that is not supported by the original statement. We can only infer conclusions that necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
