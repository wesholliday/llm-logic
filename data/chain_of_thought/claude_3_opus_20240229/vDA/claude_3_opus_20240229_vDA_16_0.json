            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not P\n   Conclusion: Not Q\n\n2) This is actually a well-known form of argument called \"denying the antecedent\". \n\n3) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Let's see if that's the case here:\n\n4) Premise 1 says that if the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q). But it doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt was not cotton.\n\n5) Premise 2 tells us that the shirt was not cotton (Not P). \n\n6) From these premises, we cannot conclude anything definite about the pants. The pants could still be denim, or they could be something else. The conclusion (Not Q) does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n7) Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion could be false.\n\nAnswer: no"
