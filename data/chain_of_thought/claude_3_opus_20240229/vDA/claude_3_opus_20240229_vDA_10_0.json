Let's see if that's the case here:\n\n4) Premise 1 says that if the dog was inside (P), then the cat was outside (Q). But it doesn't say anything about what happens if the dog was not inside.\n\n5) Premise 2 tells us that the dog was not inside (Not P). \n\n6) From these two premises, we cannot conclude anything definite about the cat. The cat could have been outside or inside. The premises don't give us enough information to conclude either way.\n\n7) Therefore, the conclusion \"The cat was not outside\" (Not Q) does not necessarily follow from the premises. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
