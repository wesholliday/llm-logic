            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not P\n   Conclusion: Not Q\n\n2) This is a form of argument known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\n3) The general form of Modus Tollens is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n4) However, the argument in the question has a slightly different form:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not P.\n   Therefore, not Q.\n\n5) This form is not Modus Tollens, and it is not a valid form of argument. It is actually a formal fallacy known as Denying the Antecedent.\n\n6) To see why it's invalid, consider this example:\n   If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n   It's not raining.\n   Therefore, the ground is not wet.\n   \n   The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n7) Similarly, in the original argument, just because Mary wasn't at the wedding doesn't necessarily mean Sue wasn't at the wedding. Sue could have attended without Mary.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument presented in the question is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
