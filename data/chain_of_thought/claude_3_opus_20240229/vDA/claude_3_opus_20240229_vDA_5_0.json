            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not P\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not Q\n\n2) This is actually a well-known form of argument called \"denying the antecedent\". \n\n3) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Let's see if that's the case here:\n\n4) Premise 1 says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. But it doesn't say anything about what happens if Jeff didn't play basketball. Amy might still have played tennis even if Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\n5) Premise 2 tells us that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\n6) The conclusion says that Amy did not play tennis. But we can't conclude this based on the premises. Just because Jeff didn't play basketball, it doesn't necessarily mean that Amy didn't play tennis. She could have played tennis for reasons unrelated to Jeff's basketball playing.\n\n7) So, even if both premises are true, the conclusion could be false. This means the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
