The structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not P.\n   Therefore, not Q.\n\n3) However, this form of argument is not logically valid. Just because the antecedent (P) is false, it doesn't necessarily mean that the consequent (Q) must be false.\n\n4) For example, consider this argument with the same structure:\n   If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   It is not raining.\n   Therefore, the ground is not wet.\n\n5) This argument is clearly not valid, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n6) Similarly, in the original argument, just because Alex did not finish the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the race. Chris could have finished the race even if Alex did not.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument presented is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
