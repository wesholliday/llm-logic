But let's see if that's the case here:\n\n4) Suppose the premises are true. So it's true that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel. And it's also true that James did not write the book.\n\n5) However, even if James didn't write the book, it could still be a mystery novel written by someone else. The first premise only tells us what happens if James wrote it, not what happens if someone else wrote it.\n\n6) So the conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" could be false, even if the premises are true.\n\n7) Therefore, the argument is not valid. The truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
