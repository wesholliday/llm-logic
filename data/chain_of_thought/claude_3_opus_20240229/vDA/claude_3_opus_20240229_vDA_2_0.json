            "content": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not P\n   Conclusion: Not Q\n\n2) This is a common form of argument known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\".\n\n3) In modus tollens, if the first premise is true (i.e., P really does imply Q), and the second premise is also true (i.e., P is indeed false), then the conclusion (not Q) must necessarily be true.\n\n4) The validity of a logical argument doesn't depend on the actual truth or falsity of the premises, but on whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. \n\n5) In this case, the conclusion (the unicorn was not in the forest) does follow necessarily from the premises (if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest; the griffin was not in the forest).\n\n6) Therefore, regardless of whether griffins and unicorns actually exist or were in the forest, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
