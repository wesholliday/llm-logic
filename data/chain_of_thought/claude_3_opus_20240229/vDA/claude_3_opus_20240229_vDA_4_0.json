The structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not P.\n   Therefore, not Q.\n\n3) However, this form of argument is not logically valid. Just because the antecedent (P) is false, it does not necessarily mean that the consequent (Q) must be false.\n\n4) For example, consider this argument with the same structure:\n   If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   It is not raining.\n   Therefore, the ground is not wet.\n\n   This argument is clearly not valid, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler or a hose.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original argument, just because the alien did not visit Mars, it does not necessarily mean that the robot did not visit Jupiter. The robot could have visited Jupiter for a different reason, unrelated to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nTherefore, the given form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
