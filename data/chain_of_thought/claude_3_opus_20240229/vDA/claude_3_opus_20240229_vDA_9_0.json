            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The argument has the following structure:\n   - Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   - Premise 2: Not P\n   - Conclusion: Not Q\n\n2. This is a valid form of argument known as Modus Tollens, or denying the consequent. It can be summarized as:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - Not Q\n   - Therefore, Not P\n\n3. In this case, we have:\n   - P = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   - Q = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n4. The argument is:\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   - Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n   - Therefore, Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n5. This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly. When an argument has a valid logical form and the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
