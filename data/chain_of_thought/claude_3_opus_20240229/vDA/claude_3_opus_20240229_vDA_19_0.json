            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not P\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not Q\n\n2) This is actually a well-known form of argument called \"denying the antecedent\". \n\n3) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. But let's see if that's the case here.\n\n4) From premise 1, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. But premise 2 tells us that Tom did not watch football. \n\n5) However, just because Tom didn't watch football, that doesn't necessarily mean Jen didn't watch basketball. Maybe she watched basketball for reasons unrelated to whether Tom watched football.\n\n6) In other words, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Jen could have watched basketball even though Tom didn't watch football.\n\n7) Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
