It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the antecedent (P) cannot be true either.\n\n4) In this case, Premise 1 is the conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q)\".\n\n5) Premise 2 states that the antecedent P is not true: \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\n6) The conclusion then correctly denies the consequent Q: \"The mummy was not awake\".\n\n7) Since the argument follows the valid form of modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
