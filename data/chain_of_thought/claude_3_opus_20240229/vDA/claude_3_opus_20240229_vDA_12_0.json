The antecedent is the \"if\" part of a conditional statement, and the consequent is the \"then\" part. In this case, P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.\n\n3) Denying the antecedent is an invalid form of argument. Just because the antecedent is false (Joe did not go to the park), it doesn't necessarily mean the consequent is also false (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\n4) To illustrate, consider this example with the same structure:\n   Premise 1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   Premise 2: It is not raining.\n   Conclusion: The ground is not wet.\n   \n   This is clearly invalid because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original argument, Lucy could have gone to the zoo for reasons unrelated to whether Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
