We can define two propositions:\n\nG: The griffin was in the forest\nU: The unicorn was in the forest\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: G \u2192 U\nThis means, if G is true, then U must be true.\n\nThe second statement says that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. In other words, U is not necessarily true. We can represent this as: \u00acU\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \u00acG (the griffin was not in the forest).\n\nWe can use modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nG \u2192 U\n\u00acU\n\nTherefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\u00acG\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
