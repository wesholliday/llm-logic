In logical terms, we're asking if we can infer \u00ac(red apple).\n\n4) From statement 1, we know that if the apple was red, the banana must have been yellow. But statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\n5) So, if the banana wasn't definitely yellow, then according to statement 1, the apple could not have been red. If it was, the banana would definitely be yellow, contradicting statement 2.\n\n6) Therefore, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
