But statement 2 tells us it's not a mystery.\n\n5) So, if it was written by James, it would be a mystery (from 1), but it's not a mystery (from 2). \n\n6) The only way for both 1 and 2 to be true is if James did not write the book. If he had written it, it would create a contradiction between 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
