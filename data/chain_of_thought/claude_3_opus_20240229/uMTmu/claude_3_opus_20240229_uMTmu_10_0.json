In other words, can we conclude \u00ac(dog inside)?\n\n4) From statement 1, we know that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside. \n   But statement 2 tells us that it's not necessarily true that the cat was outside.\n\n5) So, if the dog was inside, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 2, because the cat would have to be outside (from statement 1), but statement 2 says it's not necessarily true that the cat was outside.\n\n6) Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, it must be the case that the dog was not inside.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
