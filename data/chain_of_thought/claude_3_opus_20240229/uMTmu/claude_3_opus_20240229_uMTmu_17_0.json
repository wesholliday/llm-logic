The logical structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n5) In this case:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate ate salad\"\n\n   The argument has the form:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n6) Denying the consequent is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
