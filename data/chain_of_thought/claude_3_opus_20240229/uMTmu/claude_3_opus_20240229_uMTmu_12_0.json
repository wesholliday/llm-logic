The logical structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n5) In this case:\n   P = Joe went to park\n   Q = Lucy went to zoo\n\n6) The argument has the form:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n7) This is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. When the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
