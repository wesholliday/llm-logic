            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. \n   In logical terms, this can be represented as: Sue pizza \u2192 Bob pasta\n\n2) The second statement says: It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n   Logically, this is equivalent to: It's not true that Bob chose pasta.\n   We can represent this as: \u00ac(Bob pasta)\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n   In logical terms, this would be: \u00ac(Sue pizza)\n\n4) Looking at the first statement (Sue pizza \u2192 Bob pasta), we know that if the consequent (Bob pasta) is false, then the antecedent (Sue pizza) must also be false. This is because of the truth table for implication:\n\n   p | q | p \u2192 q\n   T | T |   T\n   T | F |   F\n   F | T |   T\n   F | F |   T\n\n   If q is false, then p \u2192 q is only true when p is also false.\n\n5) From the second statement, we know that (Bob pasta) is false.\n\n6) Therefore, from the first statement and the truth table for implication, we can infer that (Sue pizza) must be false, which is equivalent to \u00ac(Sue pizza).\n\nAnswer: yes"
