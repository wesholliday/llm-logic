We can symbolize this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n3) The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement: it's not the case that Q (the muffins must have been blueberry). We can symbolize this as \u00acQ.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we also have the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\n5) Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - We have: P \u2192 Q\n   - We also have: \u00acQ\n   - Therefore, we can infer: \u00acP\n\n6) In our context, \u00acP means \"the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
