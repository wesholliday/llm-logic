            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement says: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. \n   This is equivalent to saying: Mary being at the wedding implies that Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2) The second statement says: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. \n   This means: It's not necessarily true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement: \n   If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n4) From (2), we know that it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding. \n\n5) If Sue was indeed not at the wedding, then from (3), we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n6) However, (2) doesn't say that Sue was definitely not at the wedding, only that it's not certain that she was. \n\n7) So while it's possible to infer that Mary was not at the wedding (if Sue wasn't), we can't be certain of this.\n\nAnswer: no"
