            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, it does not state anything about what happens if \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. The conditional statement does not imply that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" can only be true if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\n4) In other words, the conditional statement allows for the possibility that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" could be true even if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is false.\n\n5) The second statement tells us that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is indeed true.\n\n6) But just knowing that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true does not allow us to conclude anything definite about whether or not \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot logically conclude from these two statements that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no"
