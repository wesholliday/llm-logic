            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if Mary was there, Sue must have been there too.\n\n3) However, the statement does not say anything about the reverse. It does not state that Mary being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Sue being at the wedding.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that the necessary condition for Mary being at the wedding (i.e., Sue being at the wedding) is satisfied.\n\n5) But just because the necessary condition is satisfied, we cannot conclude that the sufficient condition (Mary being at the wedding) is also satisfied.\n\n6) To illustrate, consider this analogous situation: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" Now, if we observe that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it is raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler.\n\n7) Similarly, in our problem, Sue could be at the wedding for reasons other than Mary being there. Perhaps Sue was invited independently of Mary.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
