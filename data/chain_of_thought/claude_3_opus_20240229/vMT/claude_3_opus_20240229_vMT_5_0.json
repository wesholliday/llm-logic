It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P, then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n   The argument is saying:\n   If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (If P, then Q)\n   Amy did not play tennis. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the premises and the form of the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
