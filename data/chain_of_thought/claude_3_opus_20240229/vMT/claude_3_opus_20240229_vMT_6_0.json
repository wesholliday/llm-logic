It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Sue chose pizza\"\n   Q = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n   The argument is saying:\n   If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n   Bob did not choose pasta.\n   Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The truth of the conclusion follows necessarily from the truth of the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
