It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P, then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n   Q = \"Erin took a train\"\n\n   The argument is:\n   If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n   Erin did not take a train.\n   Therefore, Sam did not take a plane.\n\n4) This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. If the premises \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Erin did not take a train\" are true, then it necessarily follows that \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
