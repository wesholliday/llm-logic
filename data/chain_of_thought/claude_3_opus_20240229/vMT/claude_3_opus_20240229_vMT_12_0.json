It can be summarized as:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n   The argument is:\n   If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n   Therefore, Joe did not go to the park.\n\n5) This is a valid instance of Modus Tollens. If the premises are true (i.e., if it's true that Joe going to the park implies Lucy going to the zoo, and it's also true that Lucy did not go to the zoo), then it must necessarily be true that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
