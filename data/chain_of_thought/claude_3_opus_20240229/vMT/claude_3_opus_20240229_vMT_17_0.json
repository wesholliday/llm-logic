            "content": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not P\n\n2) This is a well-known valid form of argument called Modus Tollens. It can be summarized as:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Q is not true.\n   Therefore, P is not true.\n\n3) The validity of Modus Tollens can be demonstrated through a truth table or through logical reasoning. The idea is that if P were true, then Q would have to be true (according to the first premise). But since we know that Q is not true (according to the second premise), it follows that P cannot be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate ate salad\"\n   \n   The argument is saying:\n   If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n   Kate did not eat salad.\n   Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n5) This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
