It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = Tom watched football\n   Q = Jen watched basketball\n\n   The argument is:\n   If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (If P, then Q)\n   Jen did not watch basketball. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Tom did not watch football. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
