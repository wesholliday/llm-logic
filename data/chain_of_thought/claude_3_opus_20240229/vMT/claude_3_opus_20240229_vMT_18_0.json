The general structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = The doll was plastic\n   Q = The truck was metal\n\n   The argument is:\n   If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   The truck was not metal.\n   Therefore, the doll was not plastic.\n\n5) This follows the modus tollens structure exactly. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
