The general structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = The dog was inside\n   Q = The cat was outside\n\n   The argument is:\n   If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n   The cat was not outside.\n   Therefore, the dog was not inside.\n\n5) This follows the modus tollens structure exactly. Therefore, this specific argument is an instance of modus tollens.\n\n6) Since modus tollens is a valid form of argument, and this argument has the form of modus tollens, this argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
