It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Alex finished the race\"\n   Q = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\n   The argument is:\n   If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   Chris did not finish the race.\n   Therefore, Alex did not finish the race.\n\n4) This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. If the premises \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris did not finish the race\" are true, then it necessarily follows that \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
