It can be summarized as:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n   The argument is:\n   If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Sue was not at the wedding.\n   Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n5) This is a valid instance of Modus Tollens. If the premises are true (i.e., if it's true that Mary's presence implies Sue's presence, and it's true that Sue was not present), then it must be true that Mary was not present.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
