It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is accepted, and the consequent does not hold (not-Q), then the negation of the antecedent (not-P) can be inferred.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = The book was written by James\n   Q = The book is a mystery novel\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (If P then Q)\n   The book is not a mystery novel. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the book was not written by James. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
