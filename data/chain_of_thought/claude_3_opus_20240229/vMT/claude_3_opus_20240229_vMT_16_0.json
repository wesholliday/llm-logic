            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not P\n\n2) This is a well-known valid form of argument called modus tollens. It says that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n3) We can see this by contraposition. \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". Premise 2 states \"not Q\", so we can conclude \"not P\".\n\n4) The specific content of the premises (shirt being cotton, pants being denim) doesn't matter for the validity of the argument. The form of the argument is valid regardless of the content.\n\n5) Therefore, since this argument has the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument, this specific argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
