            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not P\n\n2) This is a well-known valid form of argument called Modus Tollens. It can be summarized as:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = \"the car was red\"\n   Q = \"the truck was blue\"\n\n   The argument is:\n   If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   The truck was not blue.\n   Therefore, the car was not red.\n\n5) This is a direct application of Modus Tollens. If the premises are true (i.e., if it's true that if the car was red then the truck was blue, and it's also true that the truck was not blue), then it logically follows that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
