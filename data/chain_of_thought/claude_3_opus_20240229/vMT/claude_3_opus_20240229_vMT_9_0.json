It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the negation of the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   Q = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n   The argument is saying:\n   If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n   Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n4) This follows the Modus Tollens form exactly. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. The form of the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
