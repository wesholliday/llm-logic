It states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is accepted, and the consequent does not hold (not-Q), then the negation of the antecedent (not-P) can be inferred.\n\n3) In this specific case:\n   P = The griffin was in the forest\n   Q = The unicorn was in the forest\n\n   The argument is of the form:\n   If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (If P then Q)\n   The unicorn was not in the forest. (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest. (Therefore, not P)\n\n4) This precisely matches the Modus Tollens form, which is a valid form of argument.\n\n5) Therefore, regardless of the truth of the premises (we don't know if griffins or unicorns actually exist), the argument is logically valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
