It can be summarized as:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3) Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n4) In this specific case:\n   P = The cake was chocolate\n   Q = The muffins were blueberry\n\n   The argument is:\n   If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n   The muffins were not blueberry.\n   Therefore, the cake was not chocolate.\n\n5) This is a valid instance of Modus Tollens. If it's true that the muffins were not blueberry, and it's true that if the cake was chocolate then the muffins were blueberry, then it logically follows that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
