If I am wearing earplugs (R), it might prevent your screaming (P) from hurting my ears (Q). The premise does not consider the effect of R.\n\n6) For the argument to be valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. But here, the premise can be true while the conclusion is false (in the case where the earplugs prevent the screaming from hurting my ears).\n\n7) Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. The form of the argument does not ensure the conclusion follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
