Just because Q follows from P alone, it does not necessarily mean that Q will still follow when we add an additional condition R to the premise.\n\n3) We can see this more clearly with a counterexample. Let's keep the same form but change the content:\n   Premise: If I am a dog, then I am a mammal. \n   Conclusion: If I am a dog and I have wings, then I am a mammal.\n\n4) The premise is true - all dogs are indeed mammals. But the conclusion is false - if something is a dog and has wings, it wouldn't be a mammal, it would be some fantasy creature. \n\n5) This counterexample shows that the argument form is invalid. Just because the conclusion happens to be true in the original argument (you likely can still play video games if your computer is on fire, just not on that computer), it doesn't mean the argument itself is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
