Just because Q follows from P alone, it does not necessarily follow from P combined with some other condition R.\n\n4) We can see this more clearly with a counterexample. Let P be \"I change the oil\", Q be \"the car runs smoothly\", and R be \"the transmission is shot\". \n\n5) It's quite plausible that changing the oil alone (P) would lead to the car running smoothly (Q). \n\n6) However, if you change the oil (P) but the transmission is also shot (R), the car likely won't run smoothly (not-Q), because a broken transmission would prevent smooth operation regardless of the oil change.\n\n7) Since we can find a case where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument form is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
