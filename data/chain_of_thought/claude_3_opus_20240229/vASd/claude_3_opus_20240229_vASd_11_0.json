            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the form:\n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If P and R, then Q\n\n2) In this specific case:\n   P = you get enough sleep\n   Q = you won't be tired \n   R = you do hard labor\n\n3) The premise states that getting enough sleep is sufficient for not being tired. \n\n4) The conclusion states that getting enough sleep AND doing hard labor is sufficient for not being tired.\n\n5) However, the premise doesn't say anything about the effect of hard labor on tiredness. It's possible that even if you get enough sleep, doing hard labor could still make you tired.\n\n6) So the conclusion is making an additional claim (about the effect of hard labor) that is not supported by the premise.\n\n7) In general, if a conclusion introduces a new condition that is not accounted for by the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
