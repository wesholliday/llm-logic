            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding. In other words, if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is indeed true.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is also given as true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must be true.\n\nSo, yes, from the given statements, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
