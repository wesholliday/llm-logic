            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n   - \"The apple was red\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if a certain condition is met (the apple being red), then a certain consequence follows (the banana being yellow).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the apple was indeed red.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called \"modus ponens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying this rule to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"The apple was red\" is also affirmed to be true.\n   - Therefore, by modus ponens, the consequence \"The banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
