            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n   - \"The car was red\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if a certain condition is met (the car being red), then a certain consequence follows (the truck being blue).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition in the first statement. It states that the car was indeed red.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"The car was red\" is also given as true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"The truck was blue\" must be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from the given statements, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: yes"
