            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n   - \"The book was written by James\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if a certain condition is met (the book being written by James), then a certain consequence follows (the book being a mystery novel).\n\n3) The second statement affirms the condition of the first statement. It states that the book was indeed written by James.\n\n4) In logic, there's a rule called \"modus ponens\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying modus ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"The book was written by James\" is also affirmed to be true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"The book is a mystery novel\" must be true as well.\n\nSo, can we infer that the book is a mystery novel?\n\nAnswer: yes"
