            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The doll was plastic\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if a certain condition is true (the doll being plastic), then a certain consequence follows (the truck being metal).\n\n3) The second statement affirms that the condition in the first statement is indeed true - the doll was plastic.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The antecedent \"The doll was plastic\" is also true.\n   - Therefore, the consequent \"The truck was metal\" must be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from the given statements, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
