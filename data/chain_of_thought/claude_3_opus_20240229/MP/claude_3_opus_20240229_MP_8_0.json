            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n   - \"The vampire was awake\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is true, then the conclusion \"the mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement affirms that the condition in the first statement is indeed true: \"The vampire was awake\".\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the conclusion (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"The vampire was awake\" is also true.\n   - Therefore, the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
