It states that Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race. In other words, if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, then the consequence \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement tells us that the condition in the first statement is indeed true - Alex did finish the race.\n\n4) Therefore, according to the first statement, if Alex finished the race (which we know he did from the second statement), then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\n5) So, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
