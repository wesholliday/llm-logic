            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an if-then statement). It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly affirms the condition of the first statement. It states that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is indeed true.\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens. It states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition of that conditional statement is also true, then the consequence must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is also given to be true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must be true.\n\nSo, based on the given statements and the rule of Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
