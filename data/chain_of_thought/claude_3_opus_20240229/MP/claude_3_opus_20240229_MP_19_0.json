            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   - \"Tom watched football\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly affirms the condition of the first statement: \"Tom watched football\".\n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"Tom watched football\" is also given as true.\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
