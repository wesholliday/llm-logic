            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\n   - \"Jeff played basketball\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\n3) The second statement directly affirms the condition in the first statement: \"Jeff played basketball\". \n\n4) In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the condition (the \"if\" part) is also true, then the consequence (the \"then\" part) must be true as well.\n\n5) Applying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n   - The conditional \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is assumed to be true.\n   - The condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is also given as true.\n   - Therefore, the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must be true.\n\n6) So, yes, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
