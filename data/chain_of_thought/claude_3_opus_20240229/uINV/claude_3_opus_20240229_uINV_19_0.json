            "content": "To determine if we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball, let's analyze the given statement:\n\n\"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement, where:\n- The antecedent (p) is \"Tom watched football\"\n- The consequent (q) is \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\nThe statement can be symbolically written as: p \u2192 q\n\nNow, the question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is:\n\"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nSymbolically, the inverse would be: ~p \u2192 ~q\n\nHowever, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if a conditional statement is true, its inverse is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example:\n- Original statement: \"If it is a dog, then it is a mammal.\" (True)\n- Inverse: \"If it is not a dog, then it is not a mammal.\" (False, as cats are mammals but not dogs)\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
