            "content": "To determine if we can infer the statement \"if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the given statement \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", let's consider the logic:\n\n1. The given statement is a conditional: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the book was written by James\", and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is the inverse of the given statement: \"If not P, then not Q\", where \"not P\" is \"the book was not written by James\", and \"not Q\" is \"the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\n3. In general, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily imply \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n4. For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" The inverse would be: \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\" However, the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a recent rain, even if it is not currently raining.\n\n5. Similarly, in the given problem, even if the book was not written by James, it could still be a mystery novel written by another author. The fact that James writes mystery novels does not exclude the possibility of other authors writing mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the statement \"if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
