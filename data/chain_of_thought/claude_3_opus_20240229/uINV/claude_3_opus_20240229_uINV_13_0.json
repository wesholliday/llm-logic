            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The given statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" \n   This is a conditional statement of the form: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" \n   In other words, \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n3) However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true. Just because a conditional statement is true, it doesn't mean its inverse is also true.\n\n4) For example, consider this statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" \n   This is true. However, the inverse, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet,\" is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons, like if a sprinkler was on.\n\n5) Similarly, in the original problem, just because we know that if the car was red, the truck was blue, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the car wasn't red, the truck wasn't blue. The truck could be blue for other reasons unrelated to the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
