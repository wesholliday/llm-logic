            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given the conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2) This can be symbolically written as: V \u2192 M\n   where V stands for \"the vampire was awake\" and M stands for \"the mummy was awake\".\n\n3) Now, the question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be:\n   \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\n4) Symbolically, this would be written as: ~V \u2192 ~M\n\n5) However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true. \n\n6) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   The inverse would be: \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\n   But this inverse statement is not necessarily true, because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler system.\n\n7) Similarly, in our original problem, just because the vampire is not awake doesn't necessarily mean the mummy is not awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
