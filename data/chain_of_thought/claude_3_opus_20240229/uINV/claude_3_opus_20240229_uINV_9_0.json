Consider this example:\n\"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\"\nThe inverse would be: \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\nThis inverse statement is not necessarily true because the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a recent rain.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt does not necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Mark's decision to buy the blue shirt could be independent of Lisa's decision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
