Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is: If not P, then not Q.\nIn this case, if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nThe inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because the original statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the inverse is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
