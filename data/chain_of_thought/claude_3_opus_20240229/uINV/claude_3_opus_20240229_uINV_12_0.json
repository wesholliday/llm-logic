The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nNow, the question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be:\n\"If not P, then not Q\" or \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\".\n\nHowever, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true. Consider this example:\n- If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n- The inverse would be: If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n- But the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a broken water pipe.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, Lucy could have gone to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe going to the park. The original statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park, but it doesn't give any information about what happens if Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
