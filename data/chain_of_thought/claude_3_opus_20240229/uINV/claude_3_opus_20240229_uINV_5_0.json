However, the given statement in the question, \"if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of a statement P \u2192 Q is: Not P \u2192 Not Q.\n- In this case, the inverse is: If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n- This can be represented as: Not P \u2192 Not Q.\n\nThe inverse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
