Consider this example:\n\"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\"\nThe inverse would be: \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\nThis inverse statement is not necessarily true because the ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a recent rain.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. There could be other scenarios where the muffins were blueberry, even if the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no"
