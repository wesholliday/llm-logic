            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The given statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" \n   This is a conditional statement. Let's call it statement (1).\n\n2) The question is asking whether we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be:\n   \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" \n   Let's call this statement (2).\n\n3) In general, a conditional statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent. \n   That is, if a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is also true.\n\n4) In this case, statement (1) tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is guaranteed by Mary's presence. \n   However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if Mary is not at the wedding.\n\n5) It's possible that Sue could be at the wedding even if Mary is not. Statement (1) does not rule out this possibility.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer statement (2) from statement (1). The inverse of a conditional statement is not always true.\n\nAnswer: no"
