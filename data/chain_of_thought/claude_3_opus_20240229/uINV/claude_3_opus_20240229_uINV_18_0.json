            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" \n   Let's call \"the doll was plastic\" proposition P, and \"the truck was metal\" proposition Q.\n   So the original statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement. The inverse would be:\n   \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n   Using our propositions, this would be written as: ~P \u2192 ~Q\n\n3) However, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n   Just because P \u2192 Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that ~P \u2192 ~Q is true.\n\n4) Consider this example:\n   \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" (P \u2192 Q)\n   This is a true statement. However, the inverse, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet,\" (~P \u2192 ~Q) is not necessarily true, because the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) So, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
