            "content": "To determine if we can infer the statement \"if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" from the given statement \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\", let's consider the logical structure.\n\nThe given statement can be represented as:\nP \u2192 Q\nwhere P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\".\n\nThe statement we want to infer is:\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere \u00acP is \"the shirt was not cotton\" and \u00acQ is \"the pants were not denim\".\n\nHowever, the statement \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is not logically equivalent to P \u2192 Q. In fact, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is the inverse of P \u2192 Q, and the inverse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following counterexample:\nIf the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q). However, if the shirt was not cotton (\u00acP), the pants could still be denim (Q) or any other material.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" from the given statement \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\".\n\nAnswer: no"
