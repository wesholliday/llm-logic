In other words, (P \u2192 Q) does not necessarily imply (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nFor example:\nIf it is raining, then the ground is wet. (P \u2192 Q)\nThis does not necessarily mean that:\nIf it is not raining, then the ground is not wet. (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ)\nThe ground could be wet due to other reasons, like a sprinkler or a recent rain.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, just because the bear is not in the cave, it doesn't necessarily mean that the wolf is not in the den. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no"
