            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The given statement is: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. \n   In logical terms, this can be written as: A \u2192 C, where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer the inverse of this statement: If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n   In logical terms, this would be written as: ~A \u2192 ~C, where ~A is \"Alex did not finish the race\" and ~C is \"Chris did not finish the race\".\n\n3) However, the inverse of a statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. \n\n4) For example, the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" (R \u2192 W) is true. But its inverse, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\" (~R \u2192 ~W), is not necessarily true because the ground could be wet for other reasons, like if a sprinkler was on.\n\n5) Similarly, in our problem, just because we know that Chris finished the race if Alex did, it doesn't necessarily mean that Chris didn't finish if Alex didn't. Chris could have finished the race regardless of whether Alex did or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
