The inverse would be: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" \n   Let's call this statement Q.\n\n3) In general, a statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent. That is, if a statement is true, its inverse is not necessarily true.\n\n4) For example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" \n   The inverse would be: \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\" \n   But the ground could be wet for other reasons, like if a sprinkler was on. So the inverse is not necessarily true.\n\n5) Similarly, in our problem, just because the dog is not inside doesn't necessarily mean the cat is not outside. The cat could be outside for other reasons, regardless of where the dog is.\n\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer statement Q from statement P.\n\nAnswer: no"
