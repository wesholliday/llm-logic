            "content": "To determine if we can infer the statement \"if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the given statement \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", let's consider the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn this case, the given statement is:\nP: The apple was red\nQ: The banana was yellow\n\nThe contrapositive would be:\nIf the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is:\nIf the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe inverse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if a statement is true, its inverse is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is a dog, then it is a mammal.\"\nThe inverse would be: \"If it is not a dog, then it is not a mammal.\"\nThis inverse statement is not true, as there are many mammals that are not dogs, such as cats, elephants, and humans.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the original statement. The fact that \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" does not necessarily mean that \"if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\".\n\nAnswer: no"
