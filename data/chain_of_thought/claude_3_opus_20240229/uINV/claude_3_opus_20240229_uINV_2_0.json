However, the inverse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nConsider a counterexample:\nIf it is raining, then the ground is wet. (p \u2192 q)\nHowever, if it is not raining, the ground could still be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler or a recent rain. Therefore, the inverse (\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq) is not necessarily true.\n\nSimilarly, in the given scenario, even if the griffin was not in the forest, the unicorn could still be in the forest for other reasons not mentioned in the statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
