            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is more specific than \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\". If we know for certain that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, then it logically follows that the restaurant was either closed or had limited hours on Mondays. The original statement is a stronger claim that directly implies the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
