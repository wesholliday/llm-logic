            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' from 'The package must have been delivered today', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n'The package must have been delivered today' is a definitive statement that the package was delivered on the current day. This statement does not allow for the possibility of the package being delivered on any other day.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' is a disjunctive statement that allows for two possibilities: either the package was delivered today or it will be delivered tomorrow. This statement is more inclusive and less specific than the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement is more specific and restrictive than the second statement, it logically follows that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. In other words, if we know for certain that the package was delivered today, then it is also true that the package was delivered either today or tomorrow.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' from 'The package must have been delivered today'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
