If an event is formal, it satisfies the condition of being 'formal or black-tie' because it meets at least one of the criteria (being formal).\n\nIn other words, if we know that the event was definitely formal, then it logically follows that the event was either formal or black-tie, since being formal is sufficient to satisfy the 'or' condition.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' from 'The event must have been formal'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
