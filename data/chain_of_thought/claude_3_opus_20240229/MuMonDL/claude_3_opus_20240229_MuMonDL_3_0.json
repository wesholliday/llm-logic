            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The keys must be in the drawer or on the table' from 'The keys must be in the drawer', we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\n'The keys must be in the drawer' is a definitive statement that specifies the exact location of the keys. It does not allow for any other possibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The keys must be in the drawer or on the table' is a disjunctive statement that allows for two possible locations of the keys: either in the drawer or on the table.\n\nIf the keys must be in the drawer, then it is true that they must be either in the drawer or on the table, because being in the drawer satisfies one of the two possible locations stated in the disjunctive statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer 'The keys must be in the drawer or on the table' from 'The keys must be in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
