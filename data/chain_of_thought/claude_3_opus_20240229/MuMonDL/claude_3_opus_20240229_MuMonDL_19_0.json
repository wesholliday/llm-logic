            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online\" means that completing the application online was a necessary condition. In other words, there was no other way to complete the application except online.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically\" introduces an additional possibility - that the application could have been submitted electronically, which is not necessarily the same as completing it online.\n\nSubmitting electronically could potentially involve filling out the application by other means (e.g., on paper or in a separate file) and then sending it in via email or uploading it, as opposed to filling out an online form directly on a website.\n\nSince the original statement specifies that the application must have been completed online, and the inference introduces the additional possibility of electronic submission without online completion, the inference is not necessarily true based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
