            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - \"The truck was metal\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, this does not necessarily mean that if the consequence \"the truck was metal\" is true, then the condition \"the doll was plastic\" must also be true. \n\n4) In other words, the truth of the consequence does not guarantee the truth of the condition. There could be other reasons why the truck was metal, besides the doll being plastic.\n\n5) The second statement tells us that the consequence \"the truck was metal\" is indeed true. \n\n6) But as we established in point 3 and 4, this does not allow us to deduce that the condition \"the doll was plastic\" must also be true.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot logically deduce from these two statements that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
