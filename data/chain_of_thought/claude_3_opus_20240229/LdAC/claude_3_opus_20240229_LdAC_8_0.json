            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n   - \"The mummy was awake\"\n\n2) The first statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is true, then the consequence \"the mummy was awake\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the conditional statement does not say anything about the reverse. In other words, it does not state that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must have been awake.\n\n4) The second statement tells us that \"the mummy was awake\" is indeed true.\n\n5) But just because the mummy was awake doesn't necessarily mean the vampire was awake. Perhaps something else woke the mummy up.\n\n6) The conditional statement would only allow us to deduce that the vampire was awake if we were instead given the statement \"the vampire was not awake\" (the contrapositive of the given conditional).\n\n7) Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
