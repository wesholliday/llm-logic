            "content": "Explanation: Let's think about this step by step:\n\n1) The statement \"The computer might be broken\" suggests that there is a possibility that the computer is broken. However, it does not definitively state that the computer is broken.\n\n2) If the computer might be broken, that means there is also a possibility that it is not broken, i.e., it is working.\n\n3) The statement \"The computer might be broken or working\" covers both possibilities - either the computer is broken or it is working.\n\n4) Since the original statement \"The computer might be broken\" does not exclude the possibility of the computer working, it is compatible with the broader statement \"The computer might be broken or working\".\n\n5) Therefore, from the statement \"The computer might be broken\", we can indeed infer that \"The computer might be broken or working\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
