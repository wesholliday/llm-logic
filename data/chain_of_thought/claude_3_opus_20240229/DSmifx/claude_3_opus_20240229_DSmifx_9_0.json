It says that at least one of the following must be true:\n   - The twonk is varnished\n   - The twonk is plinked\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible that the twonk is not plinked. In other words, we can't be certain that the twonk is plinked.\n\n4) Now, if we knew for sure that the twonk was not plinked, then we could infer from the first statement that the twonk must be varnished. \n\n5) However, the second statement doesn't give us that certainty. It only says that the twonk might not be plinked, not that it definitely isn't plinked.\n\n6) So, while it's possible that the twonk is varnished (if it turns out not to be plinked), we can't be certain of this based on the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: no"
