In other words, it's possible that the whiffle is not tinked. We can represent this as:\n   Possibly(NOT Tink(w))\n\n3) Now, if it's possible that the whiffle is not tinked, then we can't be certain that it is tinked. But the first statement says that the whiffle must be either tinked or shanked.\n\n4) So, if we can't be sure that it's tinked (because it might not be), then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that it must be shanked.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
