It says that one of two things must be true: either the dreb is spened, or the dreb is vroombed.\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible that the dreb is not spened. In other words, we can't be certain that the dreb is spened.\n\n4) Now, if we know that the dreb might not be spened, then in the context of the first statement, the only other possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\n5) Therefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the dreb is vroombed. If it's not certainly spened, then it must be vroombed, according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
