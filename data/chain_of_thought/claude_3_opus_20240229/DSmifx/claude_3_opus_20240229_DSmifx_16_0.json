This means that there are only two possibilities - either the sneg is sproted, or it is crampled. It can't be both, and it must be one or the other.\n\n2) The second statement says \"The sneg might not be sproted\". This suggests that it's possible that the sneg is not sproted. \n\n3) If the sneg is not sproted, then according to the first statement, it must be crampled. There are no other options given.\n\n4) Therefore, if we accept that the sneg might not be sproted, then we must conclude that it is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
