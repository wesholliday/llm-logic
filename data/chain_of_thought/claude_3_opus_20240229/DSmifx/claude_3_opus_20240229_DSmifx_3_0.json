            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\"\n   - \"The splat might not be quanked\"\n\n2) The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It says that at least one of these must be true: either the splat is quanked, or the splat is morphed.\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible that the splat is not quanked. In other words, we can't be certain that the splat is quanked.\n\n4) Now, if we know that the splat might not be quanked, then we can't be sure that the first part of the disjunction (\"the splat must be quanked\") is true.\n\n5) However, we know that at least one part of the disjunction must be true. So if it's not certainly the first part, then it must be the second part.\n\n6) Therefore, if the splat might not be quanked, then it must be morphed, in order for the first statement to remain true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
