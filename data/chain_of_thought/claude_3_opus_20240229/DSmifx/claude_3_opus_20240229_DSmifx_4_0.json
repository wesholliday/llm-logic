It says that at least one of the following must be true: \n   - The fribble is crinked\n   - The fribble is snurgled\n\n3) The second statement says that it's possible that the fribble is not crinked. In other words, we can't be certain that the fribble is crinked.\n\n4) Now, if we knew for sure that the fribble was not crinked, then based on the first statement, we could infer that the fribble must be snurgled. \n\n5) However, the second statement doesn't give us that certainty. It only says that the fribble might not be crinked, not that it definitely isn't crinked.\n\n6) So while it's possible that the fribble is snurgled (if it turns out to not be crinked), we can't be certain of this based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
