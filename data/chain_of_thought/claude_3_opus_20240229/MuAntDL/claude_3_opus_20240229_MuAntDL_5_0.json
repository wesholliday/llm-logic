            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" presents two possible days for the package delivery: yesterday or the day before yesterday. This means that the package could have been delivered on either of those two days, but we don't know for certain which day it was delivered.\n\nWhen we try to infer \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" from the original statement, we are narrowing down the possibility to only one day (yesterday) and excluding the other option (the day before yesterday). However, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference with certainty. The package could have been delivered yesterday, but it also could have been delivered the day before yesterday.\n\nIn other words, the inference \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" is a more specific claim than the original statement, and we cannot deduce this specific claim from the more general information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
