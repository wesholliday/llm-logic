            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application must have been completed online or in person\" presents two possible ways in which the application could have been completed: either online or in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that either of these two options is acceptable for completing the application.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that \"The application must have been completed online\" from the given statement. This is not a valid inference because the original statement allows for the application to be completed either online or in person. It does not specify that the application must be completed online only.\n\nIn other words, while completing the application online is one of the acceptable methods, it is not the only method. The application could have been completed in person as well, according to the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
