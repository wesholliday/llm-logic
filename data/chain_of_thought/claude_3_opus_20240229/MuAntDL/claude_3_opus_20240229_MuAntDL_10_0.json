            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possible scenarios:\n1. The document was signed.\n2. The document was notarized.\n\nThe use of the word \"or\" indicates that either one of these scenarios is sufficient to satisfy the requirement. In other words, the document could have been signed, or it could have been notarized, or it could have been both signed and notarized.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The document must have been signed\" because the original statement allows for the possibility that the document was only notarized and not signed. The word \"or\" suggests that signing is not the only acceptable option, and notarization alone could also fulfill the requirement.\n\nAnswer: no"
