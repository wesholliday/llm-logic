This means that the event could have been either of these two options, but not necessarily both.\n\nWhen we try to infer \"The event must have been formal\" from the given statement, we are essentially claiming that the event was definitely formal, excluding the possibility of it being semi-formal. However, the original statement allows for the event to be either formal or semi-formal, and does not provide enough information to conclude that it was definitely formal.\n\nIn other words, the given statement does not necessarily imply that the event was formal; it could have been semi-formal as well. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The event must have been formal\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
