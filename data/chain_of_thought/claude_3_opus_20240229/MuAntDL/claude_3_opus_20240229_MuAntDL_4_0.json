            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting took place at 2 PM, or it was cancelled. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that only one of these two options is true, but we don't know which one based on the given information.\n\nTo infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM,\" we would need additional information to rule out the possibility of the meeting being cancelled. However, the original statement does not provide such information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the meeting must have been at 2 PM based solely on the given statement. The meeting could have been at 2 PM, or it could have been cancelled, but we don't have enough information to determine which of these two possibilities is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
