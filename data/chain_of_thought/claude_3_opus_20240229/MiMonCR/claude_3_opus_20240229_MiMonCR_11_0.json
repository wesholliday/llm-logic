            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The contract might be legally binding.\n2. The contract might have hidden clauses.\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. If we know that the entire statement is true, we can infer that each individual part of the statement is also true.\n\nIn this case, since the original statement asserts that the contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses, we can infer that the second part of the statement, \"The contract might have hidden clauses,\" is true on its own.\n\nAnswer: yes"
