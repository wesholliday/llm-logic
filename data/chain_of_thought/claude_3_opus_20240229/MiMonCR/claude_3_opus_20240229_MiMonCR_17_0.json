The performance might be improvised\n2. The performance might feature guest artists\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and\", if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. In other words, for \"A and B\" to be true, both \"A\" and \"B\" must be true independently.\n\nIn this case, since the original statement is given as true, we can infer that each part of the statement is also true. Therefore, from the given statement, it is valid to infer that \"The performance might feature guest artists\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
