            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients,\" consists of two parts connected by the word \"and\":\n1. The recipe might be complicated\n2. The recipe might require exotic ingredients\n\nThe word \"and\" indicates that both parts of the statement are being asserted. In logic, when two propositions are connected by \"and,\" if the entire statement is true, then each individual proposition must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement, \"The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients,\" is true, then it logically follows that the second part, \"The recipe might require exotic ingredients,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
