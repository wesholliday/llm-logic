The interview might be challenging.\n2. The interview might involve multiple rounds.\n\nThese two pieces of information are connected by the word \"and,\" which indicates that both conditions are possible. In other words, the statement suggests that the interview could be challenging, and it could also involve multiple rounds.\n\nTo infer means to deduce or conclude something from evidence and reasoning. In this case, we can directly extract the second piece of information from the original statement without any additional reasoning or assumptions.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The interview might involve multiple rounds\" from the given statement \"The interview might be challenging and involve multiple rounds.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
