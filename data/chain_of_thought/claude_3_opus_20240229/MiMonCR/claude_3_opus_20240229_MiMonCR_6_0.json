The investment might be risky.\n2. The investment might offer high returns.\n\nThe original statement consists of two parts connected by the conjunction 'and'. In propositional logic, when two statements are connected by 'and', both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nGiven that the original statement is true, we can infer that both parts of the statement are true independently. Therefore, 'The investment might offer high returns' is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
