The athlete might be injured.\n2. The athlete might be unable to compete.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The athlete might be unable to compete\" from the given statement. Since the second part of the given statement directly states \"The athlete might be unable to compete,\" we can indeed make this inference. The given statement already includes the exact phrase we are asked to infer.\n\nIn other words, if the athlete might be injured and unable to compete, then it logically follows that the athlete might be unable to compete, regardless of the reason (injury or otherwise).\n\nAnswer: yes"
