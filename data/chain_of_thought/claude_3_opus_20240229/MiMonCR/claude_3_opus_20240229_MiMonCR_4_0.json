The software might be outdated\n2. The software might contain security vulnerabilities\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and\", if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. In other words, if it is true that \"The software might be outdated and contain security vulnerabilities\", then it must also be true that \"The software might be outdated\" and \"The software might contain security vulnerabilities\" individually.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"The software might contain security vulnerabilities\" from the given statement \"The software might be outdated and contain security vulnerabilities\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
