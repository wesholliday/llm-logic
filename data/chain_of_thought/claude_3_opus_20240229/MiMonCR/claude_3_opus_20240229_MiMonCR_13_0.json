The technology might be revolutionary\n2. The technology might change the industry\n\nThese two parts are connected by the word \"and,\" which means that both conditions need to be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n\"The technology might change the industry\"\n\nThis statement is identical to the second part of the original statement. Since the original statement asserts that both parts are true, we can logically infer that the second part, \"The technology might change the industry,\" is also true on its own.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
