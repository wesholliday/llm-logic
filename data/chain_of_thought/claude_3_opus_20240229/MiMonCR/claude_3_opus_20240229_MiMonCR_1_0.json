            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The concert might be sold out and feature a famous band,\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. The concert might be sold out.\n2. The concert might feature a famous band.\n\nIn propositional logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" if the entire statement is true, then both individual parts must also be true. In this case, the original statement suggests that both conditions (being sold out and featuring a famous band) are possible.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, then the second part, \"The concert might feature a famous band,\" must also be true independently.\n\nAnswer: yes"
