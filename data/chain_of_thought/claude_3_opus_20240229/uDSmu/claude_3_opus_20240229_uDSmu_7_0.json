It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents an either/or situation: the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet. There are no other possibilities mentioned.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that it's not true that the umbrella must be in the closet. In other words, the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n4. If the umbrella is not in the closet, and the only other possibility presented is that it's in the car, then we can conclude that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\n5. The two statements together (the either/or situation and the negation of one of the possibilities) lead us to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
