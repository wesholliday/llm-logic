It's an either/or situation.\n\n3) Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities - that Fido must be in the garden - is not true.\n\n4) If it's not true that Fido must be in the garden, then according to statement (a), the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n5) Therefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
