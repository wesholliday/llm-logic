There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the newspaper must be on the porch. In other words, the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n4) If the newspaper is not on the porch, and the only other possibility given is that it's in the driveway, then we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n5) This is a valid inference based on the information provided. If we assume the initial statements are true, then the conclusion that the newspaper is in the driveway must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
