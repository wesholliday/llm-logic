There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the watch must be on his wrist. In other words, the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n4) If the watch is not on his wrist, and the only other possibility given is that it's charging on the dresser, then we can indeed infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n5) This is a process of elimination. By eliminating one of the two given possibilities, we are left with the other possibility being true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
