It's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf.\n\n2. From (a), we know that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the toy box or the bookshelf.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that it's not necessarily true that the toy is on the bookshelf. In other words, the toy might be on the bookshelf, but it's not certain.\n\n4. Now, let's combine the information from (a) and (b):\n   - If the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf, then there is a possibility that it's not on the bookshelf.\n   - And if the toy is not on the bookshelf, then according to (a), it must be in the toy box, because those are the only two possible locations.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
