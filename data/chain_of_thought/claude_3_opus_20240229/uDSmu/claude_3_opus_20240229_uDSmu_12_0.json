It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents an either/or situation, meaning that one of the two options must be true. The jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that it is not true that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. In other words, the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet.\n\n4. If the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet, then according to statement (a), the only other option is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
