In other words, the sock might be under the bed, but it's not certain.\n\n4) Now, if the sock is not certainly under the bed, and there are only two possible locations, then it must be in the other location, which is the laundry basket.\n\n5) Therefore, we can indeed infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
