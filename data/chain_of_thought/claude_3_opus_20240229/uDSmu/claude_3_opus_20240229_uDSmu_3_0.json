There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the keys must be in the cabinet.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we are left with only one possibility: the keys are in the drawer.\n\n5) This is because statement (a) says the keys are either in the drawer or cabinet, and statement (b) rules out the cabinet. Therefore, the only remaining option is the drawer.\n\n6) So, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
