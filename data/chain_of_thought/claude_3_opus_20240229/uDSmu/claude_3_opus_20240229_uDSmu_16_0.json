It's an either/or situation.\n\n3) Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities - the pen being on the desk - is not true. \n\n4) If we have an either/or situation, and we know that one of the options is not true, then logically the other option must be true.\n\n5) In this case, since we know the pen is not on the desk (from statement b), and we know it's either in the bag or on the desk (from statement a), we can infer that it must be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
