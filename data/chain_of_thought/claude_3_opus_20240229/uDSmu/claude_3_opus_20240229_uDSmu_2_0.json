It's an either/or situation.\n\n3) Statement (b) tells us that one of those possibilities - the book resting on the table - is not true.\n\n4) If we know that the book must be either on the shelf or on the table (from statement a), and we also know that it's not on the table (from statement b), then there's only one possibility left: the book must be on the shelf.\n\n5) Therefore, yes, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. If it's not on the table, and those are the only two options, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
