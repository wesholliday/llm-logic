It must be one or the other.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we can conclude:\n   - The cat must be either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom (from statement a).\n   - But it's not playing in the bedroom (from statement b).\n   - Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n5) So, yes, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch. This inference follows logically from the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
