These are presented as the only two options.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not the case that the piece must be blending in on the floor. In other words, the piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\n4) If we eliminate one of the two possibilities presented in statement (a), we are left with only one possibility: the missing piece is in the box.\n\n5) Therefore, based on the information given, we can indeed infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
