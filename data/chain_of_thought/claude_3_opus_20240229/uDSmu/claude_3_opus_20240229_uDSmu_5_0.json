These are presented as the only two possibilities.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\n4) So, if we accept both statements as true, and there were only two possibilities to begin with, then eliminating one possibility means the other possibility must be true.\n\n5) Therefore, if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (as per statement b), and the only other possibility was that they are in the jar (as per statement a), then we can indeed infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
