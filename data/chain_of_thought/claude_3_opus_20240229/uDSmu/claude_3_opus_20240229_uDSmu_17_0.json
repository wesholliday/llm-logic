There are no other options given.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the scarf must be on the coat rack. In other words, the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n4) If we eliminate the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack, and we are only given two possibilities to begin with (backpack or coat rack), then we are left with only one possibility: the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\n5) Therefore, based on the given statements and the process of elimination, we can indeed infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
