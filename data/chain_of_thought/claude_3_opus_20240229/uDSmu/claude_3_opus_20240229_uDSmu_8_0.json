It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\n2. Statement (a) presents two possibilities: the remote is either on the coffee table or under the couch. This is an \"either-or\" statement, meaning one of these two options must be true.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the second possibility in statement (a) is not true. In other words, the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\n4. Since we know that one of the two possibilities in statement (a) must be true, and we have eliminated the second possibility (under the couch) based on statement (b), we can conclude that the first possibility (on the coffee table) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
