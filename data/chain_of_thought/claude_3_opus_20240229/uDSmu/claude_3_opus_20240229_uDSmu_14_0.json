It's an either/or situation.\n\n3) Statement (b) eliminates one of these possibilities. It states that it's not true that the milk must be in the fridge.\n\n4) If we combine these two pieces of information, we're left with only one possibility: the milk is on the counter.\n\n5) This is because statement (a) says it must be one or the other, and statement (b) rules out the fridge option.\n\n6) Therefore, we can indeed infer that the milk is on the counter. It's the only remaining possibility given the information we have.\n\nAnswer: yes"
