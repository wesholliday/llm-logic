There could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\n4) For the argument to be valid, the second premise would need to be 'If Q, then P'. Then, given 'Q', we could validly conclude 'P'. \n\n5) But as it stands, the argument is not valid. We cannot conclude that the griffin was in the forest just because the unicorn was in the forest, even if it's true that the griffin being in the forest would imply that the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
