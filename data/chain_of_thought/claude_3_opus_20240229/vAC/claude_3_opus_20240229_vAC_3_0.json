The ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler system. So this form of argument is not guaranteeing the truth of the conclusion given the truth of the premises.\n\n5) Since we found a counterexample - an instance where the premises are true but the conclusion is false - this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\n6) The same applies to the original argument about the book. Just because the book is a mystery novel, it doesn't necessarily mean James wrote it. Someone else could have written a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no"
