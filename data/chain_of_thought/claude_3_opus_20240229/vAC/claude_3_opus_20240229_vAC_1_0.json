            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: B\n   Conclusion: A\n\n2) This is actually a common form of argument known as \"affirming the consequent\". \n\n3) In a valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Let's see if that holds here.\n\n4) From premise 1, we know that A being true implies B is true. But it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if B is true.\n\n5) Premise 2 tells us that B is indeed true. \n\n6) But just because B is true, it doesn't necessarily mean A is true. There could be other reasons for B being true besides A.\n\n7) For example, maybe Sue went to the wedding because she was friends with the groom, regardless of whether Mary was there or not.\n\n8) So even if both premises are true, the conclusion could still be false. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
