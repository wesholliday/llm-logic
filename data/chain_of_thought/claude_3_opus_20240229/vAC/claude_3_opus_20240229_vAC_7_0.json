There could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\n4) For the argument to be valid, the second premise would need to be 'If Q, then P'. Then, given 'Q is true', we could validly conclude 'P is true'.\n\n5) But as it stands, the argument is invalid. We cannot conclude that Alex finished the race just because Chris finished the race, even if it's true that if Alex finished then Chris finished.\n\nAnswer: no"
