Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true.\n\n3) To see why, consider this analogous argument:\n   Premise 1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n   Premise 2: The ground is wet.\n   Conclusion: Therefore, it is raining.\n\n4) The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow, because there could be other reasons why the ground is wet (maybe someone spilled water, or a sprinkler was on).\n\n5) Similarly, in the original argument, there could be other reasons why the mummy was awake besides the vampire being awake.\n\n6) For the argument to be valid, the first premise would need to be \"If and only if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" But it's not stated that way.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
