Let's test this:\n\n4) Suppose the premises are true. So, it's true that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", and it's also true that \"Erin took a train\".\n\n5) However, just because Erin took a train, it doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. Maybe Sam took a bus, or a car, or maybe he didn't travel at all. \n\n6) We can imagine a scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For example:\n   - Sam took a bus (so Premise 1 is true because its antecedent is false)\n   - Erin took a train (so Premise 2 is true)\n   - But Sam did not take a plane (so the Conclusion is false)\n\n7) Since we can imagine a scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
