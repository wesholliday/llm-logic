            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The argument has the following structure:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Q\n   Conclusion: Therefore, P\n\n2) This is a well-known argument form called \"affirming the consequent\". \n\n3) In a valid argument form, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. Let's see if that's the case here.\n\n4) Suppose the premises are true. So \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, and \"The banana was yellow\" is true.\n\n5) From the second premise, we know that the banana was indeed yellow. \n\n6) But just because the banana was yellow, that doesn't necessarily mean the apple was red. The first premise only states that if the apple was red, the banana was yellow. It doesn't state that the banana being yellow implies the apple was red.\n\n7) For example, the banana could be yellow because it's ripe, regardless of the color of the apple. \n\n8) So even if the premises are true, the conclusion could be false. The apple might not have been red.\n\n9) Therefore, this argument form is not logically valid. The truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
