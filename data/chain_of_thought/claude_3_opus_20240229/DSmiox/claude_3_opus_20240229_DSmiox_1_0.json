But it doesn't rule out that the flugel could be zargled.\n\n2) We are also told \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\". This is an either/or statement. It means the flugel is definitely one or the other - either blimmed or zargled. It can't be neither, and it can't be both.\n\n3) Now, if we knew for certain that the flugel was not zargled, then from statement 2 we could infer it must be blimmed. \n\n4) However, statement 1 does not say the flugel is definitely not zargled, only that it might not be. There is still a possibility it is zargled.\n\n5) If the flugel is in fact zargled, then we can't infer anything about whether it is also blimmed. Statement 2 would be true whether the flugel was blimmed or not in this case.\n\n6) Therefore, we don't have enough information to infer for certain that the flugel is blimmed. It might be blimmed, but it also might not be.\n\nAnswer: no"
