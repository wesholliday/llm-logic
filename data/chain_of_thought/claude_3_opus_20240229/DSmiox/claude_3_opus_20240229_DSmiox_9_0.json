In other words, it's possible that the twonk is not plinked. \n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. \n\n3) Now, let's consider the two possibilities for the twonk:\n   a) If the twonk is plinked, then the second statement is true (because one of the either/or conditions is met), but the first statement would be false.\n   b) If the twonk is not plinked, then for the second statement to be true, the twonk must be varnished. This is also consistent with the first statement.\n\n4) Since we know the first statement is true (the twonk might not be plinked), then we can rule out possibility (a). \n\n5) That leaves us with possibility (b) - the twonk is not plinked, and it is varnished. This satisfies both of the given statements.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
