But it doesn't rule out that the fribble could be crinked.\n\n2) We are also told \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\". This is an either/or statement. It means the fribble has to be one or the other - either snurgled or crinked. It can't be both, and it can't be neither.\n\n3) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\". \n\n4) From statement 1, the fribble might not be crinked, but it could still be crinked - we don't know for sure. \n\n5) If the fribble does turn out to be crinked, then by statement 2 it cannot be snurgled.\n\n6) However, if the fribble is not crinked, then by statement 2 it must be snurgled.\n\n7) Since statement 1 allows for the possibility that the fribble is not crinked, and statement 2 says in that case it must be snurgled, we can infer the fribble might be snurgled. \n\n8) But we can't say for certain the fribble is snurgled, because there's still the possibility it is crinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fribble is snurgled. The fribble could be snurgled, but we don't know for sure.\n\nAnswer: no"
