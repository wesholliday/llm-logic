In other words, it's possible that the smonk is not plagged.\n\n2) The second statement says that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it has to be vreebled.\n\n3) From (1), we know it's possible the smonk is not plagged. If that's the case, then according to (2), the smonk must be vreebled.\n\n4) However, (1) only says the smonk MIGHT not be plagged. It doesn't say for certain that the smonk is not plagged. If the smonk actually is plagged, then we can't conclude anything about whether it's vreebled or not.\n\n5) Since we don't know for sure whether the smonk is plagged or not, we can't definitively conclude that the smonk must be vreebled. The smonk could be vreebled, but we can't infer that with certainty from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
