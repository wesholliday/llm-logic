In other words, it leaves open the possibility that the flob is not movated.\n\n3) The second statement presents an either/or situation - the flob must be either skizzled or movated. \n\n4) Now, if we assume the flob is not movated (which is possible given the first statement), then according to the second statement, the flob must be skizzled.\n\n5) However, the first statement does not say definitively that the flob is not movated, only that it might not be. So we can't say for certain that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, given the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that the flob is skizzled. The possibility remains open, but it is not a necessary conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
