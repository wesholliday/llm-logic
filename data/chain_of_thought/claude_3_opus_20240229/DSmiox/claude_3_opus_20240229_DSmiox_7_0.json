In other words, it's possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n2) The second statement presents an either/or scenario - either the whiffle is shanked, or it must be tinked. \n\n3) Now, if we assume the whiffle is not tinked (which is possible based on the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n4) Therefore, if the whiffle is not tinked, it must be shanked.\n\n5) Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the whiffle is not tinked, and in that case the second statement requires it to be shanked, we can indeed infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
