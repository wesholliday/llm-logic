In other words, the fleeg being surned is not certain.\n\n3) The second statement presents an either/or situation. It says the fleeg must be either bluttered or surned. \n\n4) Now, if we assume the fleeg is not surned (which is possible based on the first statement), then according to the second statement, the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\n5) However, the first statement does not say the fleeg is definitely not surned, only that it might not be. So we can't be certain that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclusively infer that the fleeg is bluttered. It's possible that it is, but not certain.\n\nAnswer: no"
