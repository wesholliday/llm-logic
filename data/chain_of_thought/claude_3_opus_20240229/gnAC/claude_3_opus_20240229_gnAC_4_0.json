'The robot visited Jupiter' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'the alien visited Mars' is true, then the consequence 'the robot visited Jupiter' must also be true. However, it does not say anything about the reverse case - if the robot visited Jupiter, it doesn't necessarily mean the alien visited Mars.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'The robot visited Jupiter' is indeed true. However, this doesn't give us any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nIn logic, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the consequence (the robot visited Jupiter) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the condition (the alien visited Mars) that would lead to this consequence is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'The alien visited Mars' must be true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
