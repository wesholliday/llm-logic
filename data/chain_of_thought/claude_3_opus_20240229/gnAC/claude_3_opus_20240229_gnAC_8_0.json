            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true. In logic, this is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\".\n\n2) We are also given that \"The mummy was awake\" is true. This is the statement Q from the conditional.\n\n3) Now, we are asked whether it necessarily follows that \"The vampire was awake\" is true. This is the statement P from the conditional.\n\n4) In a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is also true. For example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\". If the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is raining - the ground could be wet for another reason, like a sprinkler.\n\n5) Similarly, in our problem, just because the mummy was awake doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The mummy could have been awake for another reason.\n\n6) Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
