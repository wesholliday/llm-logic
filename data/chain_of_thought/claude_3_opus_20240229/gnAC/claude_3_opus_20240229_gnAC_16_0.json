            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true. In logic, this is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\".\n\n2) We are also told that \"The pants were denim\" is true. This is the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\n3) The question is asking whether, given these two pieces of information, we can conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" (the antecedent, P) is necessarily true.\n\n4) The truth of a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") does not imply the truth of its converse (\"If Q, then P\"). In other words, just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true.\n\n5) For example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" If we observe that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it is necessarily raining, because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (like a sprinkler).\n\n6) Similarly, in this case, just because \"the pants were denim\" is true, we cannot conclude that \"the shirt was cotton\" must be true. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim.\n\n7) Therefore, we cannot deduce from the given information that \"The shirt was cotton\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
