If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Conditional statement)\n2. Jen watched basketball. (Statement)\n\nWe want to determine if 'Tom watched football' must be true based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It states that if the condition 'Tom watched football' is true, then the consequence 'Jen watched basketball' must also be true. However, it does not state anything about what happens if 'Jen watched basketball' is true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that 'Jen watched basketball' is indeed true. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'Tom watched football' is true. Jen could have watched basketball for reasons unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequence ('Jen watched basketball') does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition ('Tom watched football'). This is because there could be other reasons for Jen watching basketball that are not related to Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that 'Tom watched football' must be true.\n\nAnswer: no"
