            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true. In logic, this is a conditional statement. Let's call this statement (1).\n\n2) We are also given that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. Let's call this statement (2).\n\n3) Now, we are asked whether, given (1) and (2), it necessarily follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\n4) Statement (1) says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. But it doesn't say anything about the reverse - that is, it doesn't say that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been there too.\n\n5) Statement (2) confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding. But this doesn't tell us anything about whether Mary was there or not.\n\n6) So, while it's possible that Mary was at the wedding, it's not necessarily true. Sue could have been at the wedding without Mary being there, and this wouldn't contradict either of the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: no"
