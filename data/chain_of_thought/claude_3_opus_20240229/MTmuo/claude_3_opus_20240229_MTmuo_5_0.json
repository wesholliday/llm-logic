            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\"\n   - \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\"\n\n2) The first statement is equivalent to saying \"It's possible that Amy did not play tennis\".\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: If P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy must have played tennis).\n\n4) We want to know if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\n5) Let's assume Jeff did play basketball. If that's true, then according to the second statement, Amy must have played tennis.\n\n6) But the first statement tells us that it's possible Amy did not play tennis. This contradicts the conclusion we reached in step 5.\n\n7) Therefore, our assumption in step 5 must be wrong. Jeff could not have played basketball, because if he did, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\n8) Thus, we can indeed infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
