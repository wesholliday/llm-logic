            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\n3) However, the first statement tells us that \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is not true.\n\n4) So, if the consequence of the conditional is not true, then the condition that leads to that consequence must also not be true. Otherwise, the conditional would be false, which it's not according to the given information.\n\n5) Therefore, \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must not be true. In other words, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
