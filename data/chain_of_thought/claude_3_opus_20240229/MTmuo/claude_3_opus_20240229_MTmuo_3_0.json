            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\"\n   - \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\"\n\n2) The first statement is equivalent to saying \"The book is not necessarily a mystery novel\" or \"It's possible that the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book must be a mystery novel). \n\n4) We want to know if from these two statements, we can infer \"The book was not written by James\".\n\n5) Let's use the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". So the contrapositive of our second statement is:\n   \"If the book must not be a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\".\n\n6) From the first statement, we know that it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the book must not be a mystery novel. \n\n7) Therefore, we can't apply the contrapositive directly. The conditions for applying the contrapositive are not fully met.\n\n8) So, from the given statements alone, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The book was not written by James\". We don't have enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
