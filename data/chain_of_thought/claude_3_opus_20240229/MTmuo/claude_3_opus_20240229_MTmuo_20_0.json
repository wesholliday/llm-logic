            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\"\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\"\n\n2) The first statement is equivalent to saying \"It's possible that the banana was not yellow\".\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: if the first part (the apple was red) is true, then the second part (the banana must have been yellow) must also be true.\n\n4) Now, we know from the first statement that the banana was not necessarily yellow. \n\n5) If the apple was red, then according to the second statement, the banana must have been yellow. But this contradicts the first statement.\n\n6) Therefore, for the first statement to be true, it must be the case that the apple was not red. If the apple was red, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\n7) So, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
