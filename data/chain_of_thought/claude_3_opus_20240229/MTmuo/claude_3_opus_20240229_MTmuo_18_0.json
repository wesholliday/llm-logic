            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\"\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2) The first statement can be rephrased as:\n   - \"It's possible that the truck was not metal\"\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional (an \"if-then\" statement). It states that if the doll was plastic, then it necessarily follows that the truck was metal.\n\n4) Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it reverses and negates both parts of the conditional. It would be:\n   - \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\"\n\n5) From the first statement, we know it's possible that the truck was not metal. If we assume this is the case, then from the contrapositive in step 4, it would follow that the doll was not plastic.\n\n6) However, the question asks if we can infer with certainty that the doll was not plastic. While the statements suggest this could be the case, they don't prove it definitively. The first statement only says it's possible the truck wasn't metal, not that it definitely wasn't metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
