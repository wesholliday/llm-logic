            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\"\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n\n2) The first statement is equivalent to saying \"It's possible that the truck was not blue\".\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: if P (the car was red) then Q (the truck must have been blue).\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer \"The car was not red\". \n\n5) If the car was red, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been blue. But the first statement says it's possible the truck was not blue.\n\n6) So if the car was red, we would have a contradiction: the truck must have been blue (from statement 2) and it's possible the truck was not blue (from statement 1).\n\n7) The only way to avoid this contradiction is if the car was not red. That way, the second statement doesn't apply (because its condition is not met), and there's no conflict with the first statement.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
