            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n2) The first statement can be rephrased as \"It's possible that Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue must have been at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n4) Now, we know from the first statement that it's possible Sue was not at the wedding. \n\n5) If Mary was at the wedding, then according to the second statement, Sue must have been at the wedding. But this contradicts the first statement.\n\n6) Therefore, for the first statement to be true, it must be the case that Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\n7) Thus, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
