In other words, it's possible that the mummy was not awake.\n\n3) The second statement is a conditional: if the vampire was awake, then it necessarily follows that the mummy was awake.\n\n4) Now, we want to know if we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\n5) Let's assume the opposite, that the vampire was awake, and see if it leads to a contradiction.\n\n6) If the vampire was awake, then according to the second statement, the mummy must have been awake.\n\n7) But this contradicts the first statement, which says it's possible that the mummy was not awake.\n\n8) Therefore, our assumption that the vampire was awake must be false. If it were true, it would lead to a contradiction.\n\n9) Thus, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
