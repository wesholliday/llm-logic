            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book might be on the shelf or in the library\" presents two possible locations for the book: on the shelf or in the library. The use of the word \"or\" suggests that only one of these locations is true, but we don't know which one.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The book might be on the shelf or it might be in the library\" essentially conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It explicitly states the two possibilities using the word \"might\" for each location, emphasizing the uncertainty about the book's actual location.\n\nSince both statements express the same idea - that the book could be in one of two possible locations - the inference is valid and maintains the meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
