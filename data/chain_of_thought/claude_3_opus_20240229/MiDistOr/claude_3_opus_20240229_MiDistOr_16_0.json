            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request\" presents two possible scenarios for when the room is cleaned: either daily, or upon request. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are two distinct, alternative possibilities.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request\" essentially restates the original statement in a slightly different form. It breaks down the two possibilities into separate clauses joined by \"or\", emphasizing that they are alternatives.\n\nLogically, the proposed inference carries the same meaning as the original statement. It does not add, remove, or change any information. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
