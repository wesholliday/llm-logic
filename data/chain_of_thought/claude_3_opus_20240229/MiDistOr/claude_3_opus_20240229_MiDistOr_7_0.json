            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The exam might be difficult or easy\" is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible outcomes for the exam: being difficult or being easy. The word \"might\" in this context suggests uncertainty or possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The exam might be difficult or it might be easy.\" This statement also presents the same two possible outcomes for the exam, but it does so by explicitly mentioning \"might\" for each outcome separately.\n\nLogically, both statements convey the same meaning: there are two possible outcomes for the exam (being difficult or being easy), and there is uncertainty about which outcome will occur. The second statement simply makes the uncertainty more explicit by using \"might\" twice, but it does not change the overall meaning.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one, as they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
