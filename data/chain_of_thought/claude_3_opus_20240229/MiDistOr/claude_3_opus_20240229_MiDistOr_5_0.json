            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" presents two possible outcomes for when the package could be delivered - either today or tomorrow. The word \"or\" here is being used in an inclusive sense, meaning one or both of the options could be true.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" essentially breaks down the original statement into two separate possibilities, connected by \"or\". This inference explicitly states each possibility independently.\n\nLogically, the inference is equivalent to the original statement. It does not introduce any new information or change the meaning. It simply presents the two possibilities laid out in the original statement in a slightly different way.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" from the original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
