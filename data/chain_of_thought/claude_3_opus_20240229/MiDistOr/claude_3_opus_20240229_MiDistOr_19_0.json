            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" presents two possible ways of completing the application: online or in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are the only two options provided.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It breaks down the original statement into two separate clauses, each presenting one of the possible ways to complete the application. The use of \"might\" in both clauses indicates that these are potential options, not certainties.\n\nSince the proposed inference accurately represents the meaning of the original statement without adding or removing any information, it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
