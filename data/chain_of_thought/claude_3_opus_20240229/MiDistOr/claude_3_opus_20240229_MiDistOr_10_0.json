            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" uses the word \"or,\" which typically indicates that at least one of the options must be true, but not necessarily both. In other words, the document could be either signed, notarized, or both.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" conveys a similar meaning. It suggests that there are two possibilities: the document being signed or the document being notarized. However, it does not explicitly state that both options could be simultaneously true.\n\nDespite this slight difference in phrasing, the core meaning remains the same: the document has the possibility of being signed, notarized, or both. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
