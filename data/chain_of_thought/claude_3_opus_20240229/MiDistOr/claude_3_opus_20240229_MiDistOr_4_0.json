            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting will start at 2 PM, or it will be cancelled. The word \"might\" suggests uncertainty about which of these two outcomes will occur.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It explicitly states the two possible outcomes: the meeting starting at 2 PM or the meeting being cancelled. The repetition of \"might\" before each possibility emphasizes the uncertainty of each outcome.\n\nSince both statements express the same idea - that there are two possible outcomes for the meeting (starting at 2 PM or being cancelled) and that there is uncertainty about which outcome will occur - the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
