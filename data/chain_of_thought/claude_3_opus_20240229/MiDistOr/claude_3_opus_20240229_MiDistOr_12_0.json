            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possible outcomes for the project: either it will be completed by Friday, or it will be extended beyond that date. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these two outcomes are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can occur.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The project might be completed by Friday or it might be extended\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It explicitly states the two possible outcomes using the word \"might\" to indicate uncertainty. The use of \"or\" again shows that the outcomes are mutually exclusive.\n\nSince both statements present the same two possible outcomes and convey the same level of uncertainty, the proposed inference is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
