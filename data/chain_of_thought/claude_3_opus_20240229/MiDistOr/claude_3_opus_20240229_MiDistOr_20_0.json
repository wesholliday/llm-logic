            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event might be formal or semi-formal\" uses the conjunction \"or\" to present two possible options for the event's dress code. When we say \"A or B,\" it typically means that either option A or option B could be true, but not necessarily both at the same time.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement. It explicitly states that there are two possibilities: the event being formal or the event being semi-formal. The use of \"might\" in both parts of the sentence emphasizes the uncertainty and the existence of two distinct options.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning, and the rephrased version does not change or add any information to the original statement, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
