    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The hiring manager's ranking of likelihood to get the offer is: \n   1. Priya\n   2. Julian \n   3. Diego\n\n2) We're told that if Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will. In other words, if Priya and Julian both don't get it, Diego will.\n\n3) We're also told it's likely Priya will get the offer, and hence likely that Julian won't. \n\n4) The question is asking: Given that it's likely Priya will get the offer, does it follow that it's likely that if Priya doesn't get it, Diego will?\n\n5) The key here is to not confuse the overall likelihood of Diego getting the offer with the likelihood of Diego getting the offer specifically in the scenario where Priya doesn't get it.\n\n6) Overall, Diego is the least likely to get the offer out of the three. \n\n7) However, if we assume the scenario where Priya doesn't get the offer, then we're told Diego will get it if Julian also doesn't.\n\n8) And we're told it's likely Julian won't get it, because it's likely Priya will.\n\n9) So in the specific scenario where Priya doesn't get the offer, it's actually likely that Diego will get it, because it's likely Julian won't get it either in that case.\n\n10) Therefore, even though Diego overall is the least likely to get the offer, it is likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
