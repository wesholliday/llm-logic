    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're told that only one new law will be passed this session, out of three possibilities: minimum wage hike, paid family leave, or student loan forgiveness.\n\n2. The likelihood of these laws being passed is ranked as follows: \n   - Minimum wage hike is most probable\n   - Paid family leave is second most probable\n   - Student loan forgiveness is much less likely\n\n3. We're also told that if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. In other words, loan forgiveness will only happen if both the minimum wage hike and paid leave don't happen.\n\n4. However, we're also told that a minimum wage hike likely will happen. This means, based on the previous point, that paid leave likely won't happen (since only one law will be passed).\n\n5. The question is asking: if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, is it likely that loan forgiveness will happen?\n\n6. Based on point 3, if the minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will only happen if paid leave also doesn't happen. \n\n7. But based on point 4, paid leave likely won't happen anyway. \n\n8. So if the minimum wage hike doesn't happen (which is unlikely based on point 4), then it's likely that loan forgiveness will happen, because paid leave likely won't happen either way.\n\nAnswer: yes"
