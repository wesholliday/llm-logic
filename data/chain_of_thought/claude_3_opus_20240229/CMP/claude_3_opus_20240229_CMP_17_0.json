Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will.

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The three most prevalent illnesses this season are flu, common cold, and strep throat.\n2. Doctors expect flu to infect the most patients, followed by colds, and then strep. \n3. These are the only major illnesses spreading.\n4. So if colds don't infect the most people, then if flu doesn't, strep will. This is because they are the only major illnesses.\n5. The question also states that flu likely will infect the most, and hence colds likely won't. \n\nNow, the question is asking: Does it follow that it's likely that, if flu doesn't infect the most, strep will?\n\nTo answer this, let's consider the implications:\n- If flu doesn't infect the most, then either colds or strep must infect the most (given they are the only major illnesses).\n- But we're also told that if colds don't infect the most, then if flu doesn't, strep will. \n- And we know flu likely will infect the most, so colds likely won't.\n\nTherefore, if in the unlikely event that flu doesn't infect the most, then it's likely that strep will, because colds likely won't infect the most either.\n\nAnswer: yes"
