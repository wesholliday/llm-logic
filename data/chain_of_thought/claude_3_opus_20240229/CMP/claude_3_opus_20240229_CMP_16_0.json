    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We're told that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in the city.\n\n2) The data suggests that Uber is likely to have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides.\n\n3) We're also told that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. This is because these are the only major transportation providers.\n\n4) Moreover, we're told that Uber likely will give the most rides, and hence Lyft likely won't give the most rides.\n\n5) The question is: Does it follow that it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will?\n\n6) From the given information, Uber is likely to give the most rides. But the question is asking about the scenario where Uber does not give the most rides.\n\n7) In that scenario, we know that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides (which is likely, given that Uber is expected to give the most rides), then taxis will give the most rides.\n\n8) So, in the unlikely event that Uber doesn't give the most rides, it's likely that taxis will give the most rides, because Lyft likely won't give the most rides either.\n\nAnswer: yes"
