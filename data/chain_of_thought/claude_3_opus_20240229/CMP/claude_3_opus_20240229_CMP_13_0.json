    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given information states that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and Missouri's growth will be significantly lower than both.\n\n2. It also states that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. This can be logically represented as: \n   If not Georgia, then (if not Tennessee, then Missouri)\n\n3. Additionally, we are told that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, and hence Georgia likely won't. This suggests that the condition \"If not Georgia\" in the previous statement is likely to be true.\n\n4. However, the question asks: If Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, will Missouri? \n\n5. The given information doesn't directly imply this. It only states that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, and if Tennessee also doesn't, then Missouri will. But it doesn't say anything about the scenario where Georgia does add the most jobs and Tennessee doesn't.\n\n6. In fact, given that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed by Georgia, with Missouri significantly lower, it seems unlikely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. In that scenario, Georgia would be the more likely candidate to add the most jobs.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: no"
