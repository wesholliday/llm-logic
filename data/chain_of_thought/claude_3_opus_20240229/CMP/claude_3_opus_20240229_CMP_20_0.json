    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are told that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages, and these are the only major morning drinks.\n\n2. Market research indicates that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda being consumed much less in the mornings.\n\n3. We are also told that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n4. Since coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, it follows that tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n5. The question is asking whether it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n6. Although the market research indicates that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, the question is asking us to consider the scenario where coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n7. In this scenario, since we are told that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers (which is likely, given point 4), and if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n8. Therefore, in the scenario where coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
