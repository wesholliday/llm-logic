    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The question states that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons, in that order. So spring is likely to have the most vacations, followed by summer, and then winter.\n\n2. It also states that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. This is equivalent to saying: if neither spring nor summer have the most vacations, then winter will.\n\n3. The question then states that spring likely will have the most travelers, and hence summer likely won't. This suggests that the condition \"if spring doesn't have the most vacations\" is unlikely to be true.\n\n4. Now, the question asks: if spring doesn't have the most vacations, is it likely that winter will?\n\n5. Based on the information given, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, it's likely that summer will, because these are the two most popular seasons. Winter is the least popular of the three.\n\n6. So, even if spring doesn't have the most vacations, it's not likely that winter will, because summer is more likely to have the most vacations in that case.\n\nAnswer: no"
