            "content": "To determine if we can make the inference, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The given information is: If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\n\n2. The question is asking if we can infer the following: If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\n3. The given information only states the relationship between a well-written essay and getting an A. It does not mention anything about the essay being turned in late.\n\n4. Turning in the essay late is an additional condition that is not accounted for in the original statement. It is possible that turning in the essay late could affect the student's grade, even if the essay is well-written.\n\n5. Since we don't have information about how turning in the essay late affects the grade, we cannot make the inference that a well-written essay turned in late will still result in an A.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot make the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
