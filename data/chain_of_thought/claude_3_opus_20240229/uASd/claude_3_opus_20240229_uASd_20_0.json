In fact, it could potentially be harmful, as the chemical composition may have changed over time.\n\n4) Therefore, we cannot assume that the initial statement holds true under this new condition. Taking expired medication does not guarantee that you will feel better, and it could possibly make you feel worse.\n\n5) We cannot logically infer from the first statement that taking expired medication will make you feel better. The expiration of the medication is a significant factor that changes the circumstances.\n\nAnswer: no"
