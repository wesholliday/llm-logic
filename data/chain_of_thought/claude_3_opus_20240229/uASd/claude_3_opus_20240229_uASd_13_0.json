It only states that exercise alone is sufficient for weight loss.\n\n5) Therefore, we cannot infer from the initial statement that combining exercise with eating junk food will also lead to weight loss. The initial statement is not enough to draw this conclusion, as it does not consider the potential impact of junk food.\n\nAnswer: no"
