            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is: \"If the match is struck, then it will light.\" This means that striking the match is sufficient for it to light. \n\n2) However, this statement doesn't consider any other conditions that might prevent the match from lighting, even if it is struck. It's a simplified statement that assumes normal conditions.\n\n3) The question introduces a new condition: the match has been soaked in water. \n\n4) Common sense and experience tell us that a match that has been soaked in water will not light, even if it is struck. The water prevents the match head from igniting.\n\n5) Therefore, the original statement does not hold true under all conditions. We cannot infer that a struck match will always light, especially if it's wet.\n\n6) The inference in the question is not valid. Striking a match is not sufficient for it to light if it has been soaked in water.\n\nAnswer: no"
