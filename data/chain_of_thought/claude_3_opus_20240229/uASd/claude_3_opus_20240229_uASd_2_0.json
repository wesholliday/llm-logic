            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The original statement is \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"we go to the concert\" and Q is \"we'll have a good time\".\n\n2) The question is asking if we can infer \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\" This is a different conditional statement. Let's call \"a bomb goes off\" statement R. So the question is asking if \"If P and R, then Q\" follows from \"If P, then Q\".\n\n3) In general, \"If P and R, then Q\" does not necessarily follow from \"If P, then Q\". Just because Q is a consequence of P, it doesn't mean Q is a consequence of P and any other condition.\n\n4) In this specific case, it's quite clear that if a bomb goes off at the concert, we would not have a good time, regardless of the original statement. The additional condition of a bomb going off would negate the conclusion of having a good time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement in question from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
