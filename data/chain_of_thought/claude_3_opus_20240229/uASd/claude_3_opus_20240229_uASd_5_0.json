The question is asking if we can infer: \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\"\n\n3. If the check bounces, it means the bill has not actually been paid, even if a check was written and sent. A bounced check is not a successful payment.\n\n4. The original statement only guarantees that services will continue if the bill is paid. It does not cover the case where a check is written but bounces.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that services will continue if the bill is paid by a check that bounces. The bounced check means the bill has not truly been paid.\n\nAnswer: no"
