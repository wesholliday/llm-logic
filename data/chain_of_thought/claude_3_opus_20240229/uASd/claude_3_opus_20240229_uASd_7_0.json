Whether the pilot light is on or off, if the oven is on, the kitchen will be warm.\n\n4) The original statement does not specify anything about the pilot light. It simply states the relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm.\n\n5) Therefore, the state of the pilot light is irrelevant to the conclusion. As long as the oven is on, regardless of the pilot light, we can infer that the kitchen is warm.\n\nAnswer: yes"
