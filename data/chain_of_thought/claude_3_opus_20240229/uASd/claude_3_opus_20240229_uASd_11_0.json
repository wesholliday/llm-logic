            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial statement is: If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired. \n   This means that sufficient sleep is a condition that leads to not being tired.\n\n2. The question is asking if we can infer that: If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n   This is adding an additional condition (doing hard labor) to the initial statement.\n\n3. Hard labor is a physically demanding activity that can cause fatigue, regardless of the amount of sleep one gets.\n\n4. So even if a person gets enough sleep, the added condition of doing hard labor could still result in them being tired.\n\n5. The initial statement does not provide any information about the effect of hard labor on tiredness. It only states the relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. The additional condition of hard labor could negate the effect of getting enough sleep.\n\nAnswer: no"
