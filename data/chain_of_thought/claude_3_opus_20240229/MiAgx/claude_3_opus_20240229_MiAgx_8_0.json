            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning, just worded slightly differently:\n\n\"The zizz might be snizzle on quank and the wibble might wump fizzle quimble\"\n\"It might be that the zizz is snizzle on quank and the wibble wumps fizzle quimble\"\n\nThe key points are:\n1) Both sentences express uncertainty using \"might\"\n2) Both refer to the zizz being snizzle on quank\n3) Both refer to the possibility of the wibble wumping (or wumps) fizzle quimble\n\nThe only difference is the second sentence adds \"It might be that\" at the beginning and changes \"might wump\" to \"wumps\". But these do not fundamentally change the core meaning being expressed.\n\nTherefore, since the two sentences are expressing the same basic proposition, just in slightly different words, we can logically infer the second from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
