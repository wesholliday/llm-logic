            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flimble might be at wozzle wozzle and the gribble might be in the snork wozzle\" expresses uncertainty about the locations of the flimble and gribble. It suggests two possibilities - the flimble being at wozzle wozzle, and the gribble being in the snork wozzle.\n\nThe proposed inference \"It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle\" captures the same uncertainty and the same two possibilities. It simply rephrases the original statement without changing its meaning or logical implications.\n\nSince the inference accurately reflects the meaning and possibilities expressed in the original statement, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
