            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning, just expressed slightly differently:\n\n\"The crunk might be wibble fribble and the frazzle might quork snork\" \n\"It might be that the crunk is wibble fribble and the frazzle quorks snork\"\n\nThe key parts are the same in both:\n- The crunk might be wibble fribble \n- The frazzle might quork/quorks snork\n\nUsing \"is\" instead of \"might be\" and \"quorks\" instead of \"might quork\" doesn't fundamentally change the meaning being expressed. \"It might be that...\" at the beginning of the second sentence also doesn't add any additional meaning.\n\nSince the two sentences are expressing the same basic proposition, just in slightly different words, we can logically infer the second from the first. If the first sentence is true, the second one would necessarily also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
