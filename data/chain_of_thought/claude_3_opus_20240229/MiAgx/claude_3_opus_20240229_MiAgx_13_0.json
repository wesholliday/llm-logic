            "content": "Explanation: The two statements have essentially the same meaning. The first statement says \"the zooble might be in quimble and the plonk might flimble fribble\". The second statement rephrases this as \"It might be that the zooble is in quimble and the plonk flimbles fribble\". \n\nThe only difference is:\n1) Adding \"It might be that\" at the beginning, which doesn't change the meaning\n2) Changing \"might flimble\" to \"flimbles\" - this shifts from talking about the possibility of the plonk flimbling fribble, to directly stating that the plonk flimbles fribble. However, this is still under the scope of \"It might be that\", so it's still expressing it as a possibility rather than a certainty.\n\nTherefore, the second statement has the same essential meaning as the first, just phrased slightly differently. We can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
