The snorkel might be plonk\n2. The snork might be wibble\n\nThe word \"might\" in each part indicates uncertainty or possibility, not certainty.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer from these two separate possibilities that both possibilities could be true simultaneously, i.e., \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble.\"\n\nSince both parts of the original statement use \"might,\" indicating possibility, it is indeed possible that both could be true at the same time. The original statement does not suggest that only one of the two possibilities can be true. Therefore, we can logically infer that it might be the case that both the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes"
