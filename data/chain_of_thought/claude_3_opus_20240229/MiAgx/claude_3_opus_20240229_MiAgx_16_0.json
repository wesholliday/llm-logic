            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snorkel might be grooble frazzle and the quibble might blimple gronk blimple\" and the proposed inference \"It might be that the snorkel is grooble frazzle and the quibble blimples gronk blimple\" are logically equivalent, despite using nonsense words. The key aspects are:\n\n1. Both statements use \"might\" to indicate possibility rather than certainty. \n2. The original uses \"and\" to join two independent clauses, while the inference uses \"and\" within a single \"It might be that...\" clause. This does not change the meaning.\n3. The tense change from \"might blimple\" to \"blimples\" does not affect the logical relationship, as both convey a possibility.\n\nSince the proposed inference maintains the same logical structure and meaning as the original statement, just phrased slightly differently, we can indeed make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
