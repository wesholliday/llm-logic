            "content": "Explanation: The two statements have the same logical meaning. \"The wump might be quank and the snorkel might be snizzle\" is saying there is a possibility that both \"the wump is quank\" and \"the snorkel is snizzle\" are true. Similarly, \"It might be that the wump is quank and the snorkel is snizzle\" is also expressing the possibility that both of those conditions hold. The word \"might\" indicates possibility in both cases, and the rest of the sentence structure is logically equivalent. So we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
