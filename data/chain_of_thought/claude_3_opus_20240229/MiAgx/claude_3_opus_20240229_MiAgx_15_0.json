            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning, just expressed slightly differently:\n\n\"The quibble might be crunk wobble gribble and the zump might quork a flump\"\n\"It might be that the quibble is crunk wobble gribble and the zump quorks a flump\"\n\nThe key points are:\n1) Both sentences express possibility/uncertainty using \"might\"  \n2) Both refer to the quibble being \"crunk wobble gribble\"\n3) Both refer to the zump \"quorking a flump\" (one uses \"quork\" the other \"quorks\")\n\nThe second sentence just adds \"It might be that...\" at the beginning and changes \"quork\" to \"quorks\", but the core meaning remains the same. Since the two sentences are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the second from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
