            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning, just expressed slightly differently:\n\n\"The zump might be quorple and the snizzle might wibble froodle zibber\"\n\"It might be that the zump is quorple and the snizzle wibbles froodle zibber\"\n\nThe key parts are the same in both:\n- The zump might be quorple \n- The snizzle might wibble froodle zibber\n\nThe second sentence just adds \"It might be that\" at the beginning and changes \"might wibble\" to \"wibbles\". But the core meaning that the zump might have the property of being quorple, and the snizzle might perform the action of wibbling froodle zibber, is preserved.\n\nSince the meaning is the same just expressed in a slightly different way, we can logically infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
