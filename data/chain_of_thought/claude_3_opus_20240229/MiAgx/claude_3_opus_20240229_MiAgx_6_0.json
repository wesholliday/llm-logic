            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning, just expressed slightly differently:\n\n\"The wobble might be flonk zizz and the flimble might flibbit at zazzle snorkel\"\n\n\"It might be that the wobble is flonk zizz and the flimble flibbits at zazzle snorkel\"\n\nThe key points are:\n1) Both sentences express uncertainty using \"might\". \n2) Both refer to the wobble being \"flonk zizz\".\n3) Both refer to the flimble flibbiting at zazzle snorkel.\n\nThe only difference is the second sentence adds \"It might be that\" at the beginning and changes \"might flibbit\" to \"flibbits\". But these do not fundamentally change the meaning.\n\nSince the meaning is the same and the second sentence can be logically inferred from the first, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes"
