            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning. The first sentence states that there is a possibility that the quimble is plonk and that the snork wozzles to be plimp. The second sentence expresses the same idea, just with slightly different wording. \"The quimble might be plonk\" is equivalent to saying \"It might be that the quimble is plonk\". And \"the snork might wozzle to be plimp\" means the same thing as \"the snork wozzles to be plimp\". So logically, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence which expresses the same proposition must also be true. We can validly make that inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
