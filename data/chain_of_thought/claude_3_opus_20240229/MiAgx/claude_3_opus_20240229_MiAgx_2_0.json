            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences have essentially the same meaning, just worded slightly differently. The key components are:\n\n1. The frazzle might be on the zump \n2. The gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble\n\nThese two propositions are present in both sentences, just connected with \"and\" and with the modal verb \"might\" distributed differently. But logically, \"A and B might happen\" is equivalent to \"It might be that A happens and B happens\". So the two sentences are logically equivalent, even though the wording is slightly different.\n\nAnswer: yes"
