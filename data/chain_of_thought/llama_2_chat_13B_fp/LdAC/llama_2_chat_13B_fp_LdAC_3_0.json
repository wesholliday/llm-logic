The book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether the book was written by James based on these premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This premise states that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel. This premise states that the book is, in fact, a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can deduce from these premises. If the book is a mystery novel, then it must be true that the book was written by James, because if it was written by someone else, it would not be a mystery novel. Therefore, we can deduce that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
