Sue was at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well. It does not provide any information about Mary's attendance directly.\n\nStatement 2: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement directly states that Sue attended the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these two statements to deduce whether Mary was at the wedding:\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding, then we can deduce that Sue was at the wedding based on statement 1.\n\nHowever, statement 2 already tells us that Sue was at the wedding, so we don't need to assume that Mary was at the wedding to know that Sue was there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
