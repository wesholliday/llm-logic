Amy played tennis.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether Jeff played basketball based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nThis statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. It does not directly state that Jeff played basketball, but it implies it.\n\nStatement 2: Amy played tennis.\nThis statement confirms that Amy did play tennis.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical deduction. If we combine both statements, we can deduce that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since Amy did play tennis, we can logically deduce that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
