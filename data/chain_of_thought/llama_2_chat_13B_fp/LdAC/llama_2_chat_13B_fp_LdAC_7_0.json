Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nThis statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nStatement 2: Chris finished the race.\nThis statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and Chris did finish the race.\n\nCan we deduce that Alex finished the race?\n\nLet's think about it:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and Chris did finish the race. This means that Alex must have also finished the race, because if Alex had not finished the race, then Chris would not have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
