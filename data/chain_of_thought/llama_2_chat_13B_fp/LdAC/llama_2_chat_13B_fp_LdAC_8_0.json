            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether the vampire was awake based on these premises. To do this, we need to determine if the premises provide sufficient information to logically deduce the conclusion.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This premise establishes a causal relationship between the vampire's awakening and the mummy's awakening.\n2. The mummy was awake. This premise simply states that the mummy is awake, without providing any information about the vampire's state.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these premises to deduce the conclusion. If we know that the mummy is awake, and we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake, then we can logically deduce that the vampire was awake. This is because the premises provide sufficient information to infer the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
