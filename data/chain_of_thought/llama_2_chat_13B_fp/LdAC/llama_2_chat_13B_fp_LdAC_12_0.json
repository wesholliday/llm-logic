In this case, the antecedent is 'Joe went to the park' and the consequent is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nTo deduce 'Joe went to the park', we need to determine if the antecedent 'Joe went to the park' is true given that the consequent 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n1. 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' - This statement is a conditional statement that implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. 'Lucy went to the zoo' - This statement is a fact that is given in the premises.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of the conditional statement:\n\nIf Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (given)\nLucy went to the zoo (given)\n\nFrom the above premises, we can deduce that:\n\nJoe went to the park (logical conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
