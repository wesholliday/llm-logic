However, the statement does not explicitly mention anything about the wearer's footwear.\n\nTo infer \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs,\" we need to make an assumption that the wearer's footwear (plorks) has some relevance to the situation. Without additional information, it is unclear whether the plorks have any special properties that would affect the outcome of glurping.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer the statement \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
