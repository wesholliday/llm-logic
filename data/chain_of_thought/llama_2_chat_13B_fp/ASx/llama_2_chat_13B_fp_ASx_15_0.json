However, the statement does not explicitly mention the troon being zibbled.\n\nTo infer that if the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked, we need to make an assumption that the troon's zibbling status has an impact on the blip's floinked status. This assumption is not explicitly stated in the original statement, so we cannot infer it with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
