Misglomming refers to the act of mistakenly grouping or categorizing something incorrectly.\n\nIf the plink has morphed and was misglommed, it means that the plink has undergone a transformation and was incorrectly categorized or grouped. In this case, it is likely that the plink will still have the effect of tizzling, even though it was misglommed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the plink has morphed and was misglommed, then it will tizzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
