To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the flug was blummed. Then, by statement 2, the flug must have been zimmed. However, by statement 1, it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that the two statements cannot both be true if the flug was blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
