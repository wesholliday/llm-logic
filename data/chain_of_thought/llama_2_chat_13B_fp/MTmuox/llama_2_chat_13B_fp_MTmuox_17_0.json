To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the third statement.\n\nLet's analyze the first statement:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated\"\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the flob to have moved in order for the flob to be in its current state. This statement does not provide any information about the flob's state, so we cannot infer anything about the flob's skizzliness from this statement alone.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement:\n\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\"\n\nThis statement means that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. This statement implies that if the flob is not skizzled, then it did not move.\n\nSo, putting the two statements together, we can infer that if the flob was not skizzled, then it did not move. This means that we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
