If the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged, because plagging is a necessary consequence of being vreebled. However, if the smonk did not plag, then it cannot be vreebled, because vreebled smonks always plag.\n\nTherefore, if we know that the smonk did not plag, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
