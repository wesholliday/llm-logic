If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the zinger was not fraggled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can draw a conclusion about the zinger's fraggling status.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been smoogled in order for it to be true. In other words, the absence of smoogling does not necessarily mean that the zinger is false.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nThis statement means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. In other words, fraggling implies smoogling.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the zinger was not fraggled, then it must not have been smoogled, because smoogling is a necessary condition for fraggling. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
