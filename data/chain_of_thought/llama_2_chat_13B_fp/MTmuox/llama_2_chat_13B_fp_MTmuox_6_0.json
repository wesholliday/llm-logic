If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the grommet was not sploffed. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can draw a conclusion about the grommet's state.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not necessary for the grommet to have plopped the frink. In other words, it is possible for the grommet to have not plopped the frink, even if it is a grommet.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. In other words, if the grommet was in a state of being sploffed, then it must have also plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the grommet was not sploffed, then it must not have plopped the frink, because if it was sploffed, it would have plopped the frink. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no",
