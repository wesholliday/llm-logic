If the splat was not morphed, then it is not certain that the splat quanked, because quanking is a property of morphed splats. Therefore, if the splat was not morphed, we cannot infer that the splat quanked.\n\nSo, we cannot infer that the splat was not morphed based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
