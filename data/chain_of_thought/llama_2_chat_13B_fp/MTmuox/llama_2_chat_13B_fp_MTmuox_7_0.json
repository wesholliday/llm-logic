If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the whiffle was not shanked. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can draw a conclusion about the whiffle's state.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the whiffle to have tinked, even if it was shanked. In other words, the absence of tinking is not a guarantee that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nThis statement means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have made a tinking sound. In other words, if the whiffle was shanked, then it is certain that it tinked.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the whiffle was not shanked. We know that the whiffle was not tinked, according to the first statement. And if it was shanked, then it must have tinked, according to the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
