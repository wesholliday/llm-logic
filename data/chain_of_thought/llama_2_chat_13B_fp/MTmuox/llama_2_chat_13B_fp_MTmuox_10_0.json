If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the wug was not sproinged. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can logically deduce that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not necessary for the wug to have been garpled. In other words, it is possible for the wug to exist without being garpled.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. In other words, if the wug was sproinged, then it is certain that it was garpled.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the wug was not garpled, then it must not have been sproinged, because if it was sproinged, it would have been garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
