The second part of the sentence \"and change the industry\" implies that the technology has the potential to significantly impact the industry, which in turn suggests that the technology itself must be innovative and groundbreaking.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the technology might be revolutionary based on the potential impact it has on the industry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
