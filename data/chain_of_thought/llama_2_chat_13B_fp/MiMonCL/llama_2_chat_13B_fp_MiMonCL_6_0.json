However, it does not directly imply that the experiment will be successful.\n\nTo infer that the experiment might be successful, we need to consider the context and the information provided in the statement. The phrase \"groundbreaking results\" suggests that the experiment is expected to produce outcomes that are novel and significant, which implies that the experiment is well-designed and has a high likelihood of success.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the experiment might be successful, but we cannot be certain without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
