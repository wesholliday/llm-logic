To infer \"The weather might be unpredictable\" from this statement, we need to consider the relationship between the weather and travel plans.\n\nIf the weather is unpredictable, it can cause changes in travel plans, such as flight delays or cancellations, road closures, or other disruptions. Therefore, if the weather might be unpredictable and affect travel plans, it is likely that the weather itself is unpredictable.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
