            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\" suggests that the contract could be legally binding, but there may be additional clauses or provisions that are not immediately apparent.\n\nTo infer \"The contract might be legally binding\" from this statement, we need to consider the possibility that the contract could be legally binding despite the presence of hidden clauses. If the contract is legally binding, then it is likely that the parties to the contract are bound by its terms, regardless of whether or not they are aware of any hidden clauses.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the contract might be legally binding, but we cannot determine for certain without further information about the contract and its terms.\n\nAnswer: yes",
