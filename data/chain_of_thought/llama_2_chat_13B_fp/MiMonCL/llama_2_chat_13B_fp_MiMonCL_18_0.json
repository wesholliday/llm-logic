The word \"might\" implies a possibility or uncertainty, rather than a definitive statement.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"feature guest artists\" suggests that the performance will include other artists, which could imply that the performance is not entirely improvised.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot infer with certainty that the performance will be improvised. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
