If we remove 'quimble' from the sentence, the meaning of the sentence remains the same. This suggests that 'quimble' is not essential to the meaning of the sentence, and we can infer that 'The frazzle must be snork' is a sufficient condition for the sentence to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The frazzle must be snork' from 'The frazzle must be snork and quimble'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
