To infer \"The flibbit must be blurble\" from this statement, we need to determine if the two clauses are logically connected.\n\nThe first clause \"The flibbit must be blurble\" is a statement that asserts a requirement or a necessity about the flibbit. The second clause \"snizzle by zizz\" is also a statement, but it does not seem to be logically connected to the first clause. There is no clear indication that the flibbit's ability to snizzle is dependent on its blurbleness.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer \"The flibbit must be blurble\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
