Therefore, we cannot infer anything about 'zibber' or 'flibbit' from the second sentence.\n\nHowever, the first sentence does mention 'zibber' and 'flibbit', and the second sentence does not provide any information that contradicts or modifies the statement in the first sentence. Therefore, we can infer that the statement in the first sentence remains true, and we can answer 'yes' to the question.\n\nAnswer: yes",
