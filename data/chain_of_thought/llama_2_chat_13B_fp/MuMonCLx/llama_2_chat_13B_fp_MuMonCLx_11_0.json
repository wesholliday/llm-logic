However, the statement does not explicitly state that the flimble must be grazzle.\n\nTo infer that the flimble must be grazzle, we would need additional information or context that establishes a causal relationship between being grazzle and having zizz. Without such information, we cannot logically infer that the flimble must be grazzle.\n\nAnswer: no",
