To infer \"The quimble must be snorkel\", we need to analyze the sentence and determine which clauses are necessary to make the statement true.\n\nThe first clause \"The quimble must be snorkel\" is a necessary condition for the statement to be true, as \"snorkel\" is a required attribute of the quimble. However, the second clause \"and flonk a zump\" is not a necessary condition, as \"flonk\" and \"zump\" are not attributes of the quimble.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The quimble must be snorkel\" based on the first clause, but we cannot infer anything about \"flonk\" or \"zump\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
