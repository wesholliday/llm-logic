The word 'and' indicates that these items are separate and distinct, rather than a single item.\n\nTherefore, to infer 'The quimble must be bimboozle wobble', we can reason that the sentence is stating that the quimble must be in a state of wobble, but it does not provide any information about snizzle or crunk fizzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
