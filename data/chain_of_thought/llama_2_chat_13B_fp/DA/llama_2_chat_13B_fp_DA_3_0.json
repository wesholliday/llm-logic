The book was not written by James.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is a mystery novel or not. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the book.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be any other type of novel.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. The book was not written by James.\n\nThis statement is saying that the book was not written by James. This means that the book does not meet the condition specified in the first statement, which states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nSo, based on the two statements, we can deduce that the book is not a mystery novel. This is because the book does not meet the condition specified in the first statement, which states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
