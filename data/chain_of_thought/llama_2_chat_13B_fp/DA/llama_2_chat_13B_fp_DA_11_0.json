This statement implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nThe second statement is 'The cake was not chocolate'. This statement means that the cake was not made of chocolate.\n\nNow, let's think about what these two statements together mean. If the cake was not chocolate, then it is not possible for the muffins to have been blueberry, because the first statement only applies if the cake was chocolate. Therefore, we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
