Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement implies that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it is not possible for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThis statement tells us that Lisa did not purchase the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\nIf Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nSince we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it follows that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
