This means that the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is false.\n\nSecond, we know that the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is false, so we can infer that the second part of the statement \"Kate ate the salad\" is also false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
