If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, as the two are mutually inclusive.\n\nPremise 2: This premise is true because it is a statement of fact. The vampire was not awake, as we are assuming that the vampire is asleep.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\nConclusion: The mummy was not awake.\n\nSince both premises are true, the conclusion logically follows. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
