            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer that Amy did not play tennis based on the given information, we need to use logical reasoning and the principles of deductive logic.\n\nThe premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Jeff played basketball\" and the consequence is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nNow, we know that Jeff did not play basketball, so we can deduce that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" does not hold true. Therefore, the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" does not follow. In other words, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
