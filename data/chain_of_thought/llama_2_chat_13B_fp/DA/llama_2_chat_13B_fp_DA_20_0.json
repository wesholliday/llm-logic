However, if the apple is not red, then the banana may or may not be yellow.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given premises. The absence of the premise 'The apple was red' does not provide sufficient information to infer the absence of the premise 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no",
