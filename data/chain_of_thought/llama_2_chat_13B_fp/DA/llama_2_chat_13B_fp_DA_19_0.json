            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball based on the given information, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement is \"Tom did not watch football.\" This means that Tom did not watch football, which implies that the condition for the first statement to be true (i.e., Tom watching football) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the first statement is false, and hence we cannot infer that Jen watched basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
