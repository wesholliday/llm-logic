Alex did not finish the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Chris did not finish the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement implies that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race. It establishes a direct relationship between Alex and Chris's completion of the race.\n\nStatement 2: Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThis statement means that Alex did not complete the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements:\n\nIf Alex did not finish the race, then it is not possible for Chris to have finished the race, since the first statement implies that Chris only finished the race if Alex did. Therefore, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
