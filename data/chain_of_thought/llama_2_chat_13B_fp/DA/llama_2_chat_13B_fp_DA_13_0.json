            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue, we need to evaluate the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement implies a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\nThe second statement is \"The car was not red.\" This statement negates the first statement's condition, as the car cannot be red if it is not red.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these statements:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck would be blue (based on the first statement).\n2. The car is not red (based on the second statement).\n\nSince the car is not red, the first statement's condition is not met, and therefore, we cannot infer that the truck is blue.\n\nAnswer: No",
