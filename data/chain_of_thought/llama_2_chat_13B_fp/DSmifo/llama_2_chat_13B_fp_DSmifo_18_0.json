Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand.\n\nIf the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer, since the second statement states that the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
