Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is on the shelf based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the book might not be resting on the table, which means it could be anywhere else, including the shelf.\n\nStatement 2 states that the book must be either resting on the table or on the shelf. This means that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the book might not be resting on the table and it must be either resting on the table or on the shelf, then it follows that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
