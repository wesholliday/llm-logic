Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sunglasses are in her bag. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head and compare it to the possibility of them being in her bag.\n\nIf the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag, since the second statement states that either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
