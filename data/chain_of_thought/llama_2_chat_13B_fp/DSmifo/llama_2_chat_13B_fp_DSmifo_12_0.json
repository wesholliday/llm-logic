Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the jacket is draped over the chair. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the jacket being hanging in the closet.\n\nIf the jacket is hanging in the closet, then it cannot be draped over the chair, as the two statements are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the jacket is hanging in the closet, we can conclude that it is not draped over the chair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair, as there is no other possibility.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
