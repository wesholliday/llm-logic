Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the scarf being draped on the coat rack.\n\nIf the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack, based on statement 2. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
