Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, which means they could be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 states that the cookies must be either hidden in the pantry or in the jar. This means that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar, based on statement 2. And since statement 1 suggests that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
