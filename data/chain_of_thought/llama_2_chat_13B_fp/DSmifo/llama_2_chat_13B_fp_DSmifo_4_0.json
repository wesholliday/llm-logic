Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cat is napping on the couch. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the cat being in the bedroom.\n\nIf the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
