Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the keys are in the drawer. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the keys being dangling in the cabinet.\n\nIf the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (based on statement 1), then they must be in the drawer (based on statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
