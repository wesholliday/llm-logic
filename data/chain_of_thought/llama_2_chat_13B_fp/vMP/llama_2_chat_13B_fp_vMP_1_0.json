            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so we can use a truth table to evaluate its validity.\n\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\nPremise 2: Mary was at the wedding\nConclusion: Sue was at the wedding\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true, and see what we can infer about the conclusion.\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding (Premise 2), then we can deduce that Sue was at the wedding (Premise 1). Therefore, the conclusion Sue was at the wedding is logically implied by the premises.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the argument is logically valid, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises, regardless of the truth or falsehood of the premises. To do this, we can use a truth table to evaluate the argument.\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | False |\n| False | False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion logically follows from the premises, regardless of their truth or falsehood.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
