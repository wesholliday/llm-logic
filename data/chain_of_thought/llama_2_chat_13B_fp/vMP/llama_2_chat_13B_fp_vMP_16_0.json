            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each part separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a certain condition (the shirt being cotton) and its consequences (the pants being denim). The premise is saying that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but it is not saying that the pants are denim because the shirt is cotton.\n\nThe second premise is 'The shirt was cotton'. This premise is a simple statement of fact, and it is not a conditional statement like the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'The pants were denim'. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, and we have already established that the shirt was cotton.\n\nNow, let's consider the validity of the argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, and we have already established that the shirt was cotton. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
