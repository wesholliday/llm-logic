            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so we can use a truth table to evaluate its validity.\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\nPremise 2: The vampire was awake\nConclusion: The mummy was awake\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true, and let's consider the possible combinations of truth values for the premises:\n\n1. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: True\n2. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: True\n3. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: False\n4. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: False\n\nNow, let's examine each combination and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: True\n\nIf both premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows, so the argument is valid in this case.\n\n2. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: True\n\nIf the first premise is false, then the conclusion cannot logically follow, so the argument is invalid in this case.\n\n3. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: False\n\nIf the first premise is true and the second premise is false, then the conclusion does not logically follow, so the argument is invalid in this case.\n\n4. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: False\n\nIf both premises are false, then the conclusion does not logically follow, so the argument is invalid in this case.\n\nBased on the truth table, we can see that the argument is not logically valid, because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises in all possible combinations. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: No",
