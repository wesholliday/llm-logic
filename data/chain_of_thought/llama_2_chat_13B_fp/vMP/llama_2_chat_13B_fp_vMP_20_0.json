            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each part separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothetical situation is the apple being red, and the consequence is the banana being yellow.\n\nThe second premise is 'The apple was red'. This premise is a simple statement of fact, and it is not a conditional statement like the first premise.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument, which is 'The banana was yellow'. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, because if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (by the first premise). Therefore, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid if the premises are true. If the apple was indeed red, and the premise 'The apple was red' is true, then the conclusion 'The banana was yellow' logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
