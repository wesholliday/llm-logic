If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book was written by James.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true. If the book was written by James, then it is reasonable to infer that the book is a mystery novel. This is because James is known for writing mystery novels, so it is likely that any book he writes will be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
