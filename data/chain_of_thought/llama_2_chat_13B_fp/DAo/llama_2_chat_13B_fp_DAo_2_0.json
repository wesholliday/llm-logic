If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the unicorn was not in the forest. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" given that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nLet's assume that the griffin was in the forest. In this case, the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" would be true, since the griffin is in the forest and the unicorn would also be in the forest.\n\nHowever, we are given that the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is false, since the griffin is not in the forest and the unicorn would not be in the forest.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAnswer: No",
