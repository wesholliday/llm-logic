The second statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' implies that if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have eaten salad.\n\nTo infer 'Kate did not eat salad', we need to negate the second statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'Kate did not eat salad'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
