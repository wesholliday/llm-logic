If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the robot visited Jupiter or not. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the alien visited Mars (this is the hypothesis we want to test). If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, according to statement 2. This means that if the alien visited Mars, the robot would have visited Jupiter, and we would have observed the robot on Jupiter.\n\nHowever, we are given that the alien did not visit Mars, so the hypothesis that the alien visited Mars is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the robot visited Jupiter, as the hypothesis that the alien visited Mars is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
