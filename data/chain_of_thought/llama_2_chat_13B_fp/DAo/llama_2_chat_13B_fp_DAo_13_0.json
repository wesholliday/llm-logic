            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The truck was not blue' from 'The car was not red' together with 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe first statement 'The car was not red' implies that the car was not of the color red. The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' implies that if the car was of the color red, then the truck would be of the color blue.\n\nWe can start by assuming that the car was red, and then see what we can infer about the truck. If the car was red, then the truck would be blue, according to the second statement. However, we know that the car was not red, so we cannot infer that the truck was blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from 'The car was not red' together with 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: no",
