            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' and 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe first statement 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' implies that Lisa did not purchase the red shirt. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement that implies if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\nSince Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is because the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is not satisfied, as Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
