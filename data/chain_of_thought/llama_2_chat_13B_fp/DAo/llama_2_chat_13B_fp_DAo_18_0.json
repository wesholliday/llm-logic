If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the truck was not metal.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the doll was not plastic. This information does not directly relate to the truck.\n\nStatement 2 states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll was plastic, it would have a direct impact on the truck's material.\n\nNow, we know that the doll was not plastic, so we can't infer that the truck was metal based on Statement 2.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAnswer: No",
