If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is not a mystery novel. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the second statement given the first statement.\n\nIf the book was not written by James, then the book cannot be a mystery novel, since the second statement states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. Therefore, we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
