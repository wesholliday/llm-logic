The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' implies that if Mary had attended the wedding, then Sue would have attended the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Mary did not attend the wedding (which is what the first statement tells us), we can logically deduce that Sue did not attend the wedding as well, since Mary's attendance would have been a necessary condition for Sue's attendance.\n\nAnswer: yes",
