To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the second statement given the first statement.\n\nIf the vampire was not awake, then the condition for the mummy to be awake (i.e., the vampire being awake) is not met. Therefore, the mummy cannot be awake.\n\nSo, we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
