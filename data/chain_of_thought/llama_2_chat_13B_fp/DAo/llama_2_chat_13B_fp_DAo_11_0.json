Therefore, we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry if the cake was not chocolate.\n\nHowever, we also know that 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' implies that if the cake was of the type that would have blueberry muffins, then the muffins would be blueberry.\n\nSo, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
