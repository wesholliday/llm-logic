The statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' implies that if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, since Joe did not go to the park, we cannot infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
