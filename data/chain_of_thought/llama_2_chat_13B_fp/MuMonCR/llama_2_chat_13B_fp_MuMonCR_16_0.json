            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" implies that the room was cleaned every day. This means that the room was cleaned on the previous day as well, before the day the speaker is referring to.\n\nThe statement \"and had fresh towels\" implies that there were fresh towels available in the room on the day the speaker is referring to.\n\nNow, let's think about the inference we can draw from these two statements. If the room was cleaned daily, then it is likely that the towels were also replaced or refreshed daily. This is because cleaning the room would involve changing the towels, as they would be considered \"used\" after one day.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the room must have had fresh towels.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
