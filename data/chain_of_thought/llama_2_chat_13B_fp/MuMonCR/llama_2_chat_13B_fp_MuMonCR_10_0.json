            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that the document has been signed by the person who created it, and that signature has been verified by a notary public. However, it does not explicitly state that the document must have been notarized.\n\nTo infer that the document must have been notarized, we need to consider the fact that notarization is a process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing their signature. If the document has been signed and notarized, it is likely that the notary public has verified the identity of the signer and witnessed their signature, which means that the document has been notarized.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the document must have been notarized based on the fact that it has been signed and notarized, but it is not explicitly stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
