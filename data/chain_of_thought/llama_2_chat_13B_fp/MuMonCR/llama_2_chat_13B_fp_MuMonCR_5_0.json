However, it does not directly imply that the package was signed for.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons why the package might have been delivered and signed for:\n\n1. The recipient was present at the delivery location and signed for the package.\n2. The recipient had previously arranged for someone else to sign for the package on their behalf.\n3. The delivery person signed for the package on behalf of the recipient, perhaps because the recipient was not present or could not be found.\n\nTherefore, while we can infer that the package was delivered and signed for, we cannot directly infer that it was signed for without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
