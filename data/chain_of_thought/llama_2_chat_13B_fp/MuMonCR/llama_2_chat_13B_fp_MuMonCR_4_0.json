The second statement \"in the conference room\" provides additional information about the location of the meeting.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" from the two statements, we need to consider the possibility that the meeting could have taken place at a different time or location. However, since the first statement already establishes the time of the meeting as 2 PM, it is reasonable to infer that the meeting must have been in the conference room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
