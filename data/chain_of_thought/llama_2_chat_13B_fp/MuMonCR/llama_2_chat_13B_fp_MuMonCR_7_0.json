However, it does not explicitly state that the exam covered all chapters.\n\nTo infer that the exam covered all chapters, we need to make an assumption that a difficult exam would necessarily cover all the chapters. This assumption is not necessarily true, as a difficult exam could still be limited to certain chapters or topics.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the exam covered all chapters solely based on the statement \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
