The second statement 'Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser' suggests that the watch is either on the person's wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n\nIf we assume that the watch is not on the person's wrist, then the only possible location for the watch is on the dresser, charging. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
