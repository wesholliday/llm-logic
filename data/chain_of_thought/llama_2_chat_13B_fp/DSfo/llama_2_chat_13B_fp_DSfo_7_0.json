This means that the umbrella is either in the car or somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the umbrella is either tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. This means that if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet (which we know from Statement 1), then it must be in the car.\n\nSo, based on the two statements, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
