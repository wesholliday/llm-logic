Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's first consider statement 1: \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This statement tells us that the notebook is not currently sitting on the nightstand. However, it does not provide any information about the location of the notebook.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This statement tells us that the notebook must be either sitting on the nightstand or in the drawer. If the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, then it is not in the drawer. Therefore, if the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
