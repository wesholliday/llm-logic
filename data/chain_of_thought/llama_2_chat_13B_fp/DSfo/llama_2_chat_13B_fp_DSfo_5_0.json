This means that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it doesn't tell us where they are.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the cookies are either hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. We know that the cookies are not in the pantry, and we know that they are either in the pantry or in the jar. Since we have already established that the cookies are not in the pantry, the only possibility left is that they are in the jar.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
