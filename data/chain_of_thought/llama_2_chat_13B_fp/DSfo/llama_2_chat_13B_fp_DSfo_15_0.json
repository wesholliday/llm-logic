This suggests that the shoes are either in a different location or not present at all.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet' provides two possible locations for the shoes: by the door or in the closet. Since we know that the shoes are not by the door, we can infer that they must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
