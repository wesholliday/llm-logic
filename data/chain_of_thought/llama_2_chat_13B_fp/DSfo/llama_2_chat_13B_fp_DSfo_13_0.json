To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, so we can eliminate that option. This means that the toy must be in the toy box or somewhere else.\n\nSecond, we are told that either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box. This means that if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
