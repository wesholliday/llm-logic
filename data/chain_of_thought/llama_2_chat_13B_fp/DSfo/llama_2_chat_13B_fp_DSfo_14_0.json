This means that the milk is either on the counter or it is not in the fridge.\n\nSecond, we are given that either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. This means that if the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
