            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. The book isn't resting on the table.\n2. Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is on the shelf based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the book is not resting on the table. This means that the book is either not on the table or it is not resting on the table.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book is either resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This means that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nIf the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf. (This follows from Statement 2.)\n\nSince we know that the book isn't resting on the table (from Statement 1), we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
