The second statement 'Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair' suggests that the jacket is either in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nSince the first statement 'The jacket isn't hanging in the closet' contradicts the second statement 'Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair', we cannot infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
