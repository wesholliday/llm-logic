'The sunglasses aren't perched on her head' means that the sunglasses are not currently located on her head.\n2. 'Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag' means that the sunglasses are either located on her head or in her bag.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements using logical conjunction (AND):\n\n'The sunglasses aren't perched on her head' AND 'Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag'\n\nThis combination of statements implies that the sunglasses are not on her head and are either in her bag or somewhere else. Since we know they are not on her head, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
