'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom' - This statement tells us that the cat is not currently playing in the bedroom.\n2. 'Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch' - This statement tells us that the cat is either playing in the bedroom or it is napping on the couch.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements using logical inference. Since the cat is not playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
