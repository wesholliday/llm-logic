            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The doll was plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' together with 'The truck was metal', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement 'The truck was metal' is a simple statement that asserts the truck's material to be metal.\n\nTo infer 'The doll was plastic', we need to substitute the second statement 'The truck was metal' into the first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This gives us:\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\n\nSince the truck was metal, we can infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
