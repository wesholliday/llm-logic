If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n2. Bob chose pasta\n\nWe can start by assuming that Bob chose pasta, and then examine the implications of this assumption for Sue's choice.\n\nIf Bob chose pasta, then the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" becomes true. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, which is what we know to be true based on statement 2.\n\nTherefore, if Bob chose pasta, then it is possible that Sue chose pizza, but it is not certain. We can infer that Sue might have chosen pizza, but we cannot definitively say that she did.\n\nAnswer: no",
