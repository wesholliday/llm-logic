            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the shirt was cotton based on the statements \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim\", we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This statement implies that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. In other words, the material of the shirt determines the material of the pants.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The pants were denim\". This statement tells us that the pants are indeed made of denim.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the shirt was cotton. Here's why:\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (given the first statement).\nThe pants were denim (given the second statement).\nTherefore, the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
