It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is on the shelf. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the book's location.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nThis statement tells us that the book cannot be both on the shelf and resting on the table at the same time. If the book is on the shelf, then it cannot be resting on the table, and if it is resting on the table, then it cannot be on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nThis statement tells us that the book is not required to be resting on the table. This means that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together and see if we can infer anything about the book's location. If the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table, according to statement 2. But if it is resting on the table, then it cannot be on the shelf, according to statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table. This means that if we know that the book is not on the shelf, we can infer that it is resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
