It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Fido is inside based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nThis statement tells us that Fido is either inside or in the garden. It does not tell us which one is true, only that one of them is true.\n\n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nThis statement tells us that Fido cannot be required to be in the garden. It does not rule out the possibility that Fido might be in the garden, but it does tell us that Fido cannot be forced to be there.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements.\n\nIf Fido is inside, then the first statement would be true, and the second statement would be false. However, if Fido is not inside, then the first statement would be false, and the second statement would be true.\n\nSo, we can infer that Fido is inside if we can assume that the first statement is true. But we cannot infer that Fido is inside based solely on the second statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
