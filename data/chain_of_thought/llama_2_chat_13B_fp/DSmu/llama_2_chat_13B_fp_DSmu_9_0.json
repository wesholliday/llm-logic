It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing puzzle piece is in the box. To do this, we can use logical negation elimination.\n\nIf the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor, then it cannot be in the box. Therefore, if statement 2 is true, then the missing puzzle piece cannot be in the box.\n\nOn the other hand, if the missing puzzle piece is in the box, then it cannot be blending in on the floor. Therefore, if statement 1 is true, then the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nSo, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box if statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
