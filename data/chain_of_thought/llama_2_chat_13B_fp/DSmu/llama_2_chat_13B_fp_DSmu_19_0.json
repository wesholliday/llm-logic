It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the watch is charging on the dresser. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can deduce the location of the watch.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nThis statement tells us that the watch can either be charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. There is no other option. So, if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nThis statement tells us that the watch cannot be on his wrist. This means that the only possible location for the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nBased on the two statements, we can deduce that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
