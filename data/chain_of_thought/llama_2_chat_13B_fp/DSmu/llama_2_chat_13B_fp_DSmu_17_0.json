It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the scarf is either in my backpack or on the coat rack. This means that if the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in my backpack.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack. Therefore, based on statement 1, we know that the scarf must be in my backpack.\n\nExplanation:\n\nNow that we have analyzed the statements, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
