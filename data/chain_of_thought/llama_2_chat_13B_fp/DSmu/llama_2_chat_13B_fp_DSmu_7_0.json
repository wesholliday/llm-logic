It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the umbrella is in the car based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet. This means that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the umbrella must not be tucked away in the closet. This means that if the umbrella is not in the car, then it must be in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\nIf the umbrella is in the car, then both statements are true:\n\n1. The umbrella is in the car (Statement 1).\n2. The umbrella must not be tucked away in the closet (Statement 2).\n\nIf the umbrella is not in the car, then both statements are false:\n\n1. The umbrella is not in the car (Statement 1).\n2. The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet (Statement 2).\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
