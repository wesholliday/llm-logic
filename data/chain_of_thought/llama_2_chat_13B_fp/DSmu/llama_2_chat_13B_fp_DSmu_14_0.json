It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the milk is on the counter. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nThis statement tells us that the milk is either on the counter or it is not on the counter (i.e., it must be in the fridge). However, it does not tell us which one is true.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nThis statement tells us that the milk cannot be in the fridge. Therefore, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
