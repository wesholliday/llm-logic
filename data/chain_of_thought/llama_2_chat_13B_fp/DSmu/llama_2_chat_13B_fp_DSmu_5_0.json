It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they cannot be hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry (Statement 1). However, we know that this is not the case (Statement 2). Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
