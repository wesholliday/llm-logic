This opens up the possibility that the book could be in another location, such as a drawer.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase 'might be' is a more general phrase that implies a possibility or a chance that something might happen or exist. In this case, it implies that there is a possibility that the book might be in a different location, such as a drawer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
