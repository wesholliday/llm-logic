However, it does not provide any information about whether the package will be delayed or not.\n\nTo infer \"The package might be delayed or delivered\", we need to consider the possibility that the package might be delayed, as well as the possibility that it might be delivered on time. This is because the statement \"The package might be delivered\" only tells us that there is a possibility that the package might be delivered, without providing any information about the likelihood of this happening.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The package might be delayed or delivered\" from the statement \"The package might be delivered\" alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
