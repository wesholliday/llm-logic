Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert has sold out based on this statement alone.\n\nHowever, we can infer that there might be available tickets for the concert, as the statement suggests that there is a possibility that not all tickets have been sold. This is because if all tickets had been sold, it would be certain that the concert is sold out, and there would be no possibility of available tickets.\n\nAnswer: no",
