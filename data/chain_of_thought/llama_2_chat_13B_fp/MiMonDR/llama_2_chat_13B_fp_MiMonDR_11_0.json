In order to infer that the weather might be rainy or sunny, we would need additional information or context.\n\nFor example, if we know that it is the rainy season or that there is a storm front in the area, we might infer that the weather might be rainy. However, based solely on the statement \"The weather might be sunny\", we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
