This suggests that the meeting has not yet been confirmed or scheduled, and it is still in the planning stages.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the meeting might be scheduled or cancelled because it has not yet been confirmed, and there is a possibility that it may be cancelled or postponed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
