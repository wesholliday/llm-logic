            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, we need to evaluate the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nWe can deduce from statement 1 that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. Since statement 2 states that Sue was at the wedding, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be there too.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the fact that Sue was at the wedding implies that Mary was also there. To do this, we can use a technique called \"hypothetical syllogism.\"\n\nA hypothetical syllogism is a type of argument that consists of three parts:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nIn this case, we can construct a hypothetical syllogism as follows:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n2. Sue was at the wedding\n3. Therefore, Mary was at the wedding\n\nSince the first two premises are true, and the conclusion logically follows from them, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
