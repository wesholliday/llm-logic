Chris finished the race (premise 2)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Alex finished the race. To determine this, we can use logical inference.\n\nFirst, let's assume that Alex did not finish the race. This means that premise 1 is false, since \"If Alex finished the race\" is not true.\n\nNow, we know that Chris finished the race (premise 2), so we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race. This is a logical contradiction, since we have assumed that Alex did not finish the race, but Chris did.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that Alex did not finish the race must be false, and we can conclude that Alex did finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
