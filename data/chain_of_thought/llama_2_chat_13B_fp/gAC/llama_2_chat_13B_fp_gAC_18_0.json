            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the statement \"The doll was plastic\" is true, we need to evaluate the given information and the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (doll was plastic) is true, then the consequent (truck was metal) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The truck was metal\" is a simple statement that is independent of the first statement.\n\nTo determine the truth of the statement \"The doll was plastic\", we need to consider the possibility that the doll might not be plastic, even if the truck is metal.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSince the second statement \"The truck was metal\" is true, we can infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would not be metal. However, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic based solely on the fact that the truck was metal. Therefore, the statement \"The doll was plastic\" cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.",
