            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the statement \"The shirt was cotton\" is true, we need to evaluate the given information and the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The pants were denim\" is a simple statement that is independent of the first statement.\n\nTo determine the truth of the statement \"The shirt was cotton\", we need to consider the possibility that the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) may not be true. If the antecedent is false, then the consequent (the pants were denim) cannot be true, regardless of the truth of the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we need to evaluate the truth of the antecedent \"The shirt was cotton\" before determining the truth of the statement \"The shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: no",
