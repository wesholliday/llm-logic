Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe need to determine if it follows that Lisa bought the red shirt. To do this, we can use a truth table to evaluate the two premises and see if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | False |\n| False | False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that if both premises are true, then the conclusion (Lisa bought the red shirt) is also true. Therefore, based on the given information, it does follow that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
