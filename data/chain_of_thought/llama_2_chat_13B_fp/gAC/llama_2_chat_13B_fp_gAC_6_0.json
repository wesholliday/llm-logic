Bob chose pasta (let's call this premise P2)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Sue chose pizza. To determine this, we can use logical inference.\n\nFirst, let's assume that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that P1 is false, since if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, we know that P2 is true, since Bob did choose pasta. But if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob's choice of pasta is not determined by Sue's choice. In other words, Bob's choice of pasta does not imply Sue's choice of pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
