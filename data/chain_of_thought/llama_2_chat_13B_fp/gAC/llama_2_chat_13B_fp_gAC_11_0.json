            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if it follows that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, which means that it expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothetical situation is \"the cake was chocolate\" and the consequence is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This statement is a simple statement of fact, and it is independent of the first statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the truth of the second statement logically follows from the truth of the first statement. In other words, we need to determine if the truth of \"The muffins were blueberry\" can be deduced from the truth of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called \"resolution,\" which involves breaking down the conditional statement into its component parts and evaluating each part separately.\n\nHere's how we can do this:\n\n1. The antecedent of the conditional statement is \"the cake was chocolate.\"\n2. The consequent of the conditional statement is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nSince we know that the muffins were blueberry (this is the second statement), we can conclude that the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) must be true. Therefore, we can deduce that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
