            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the book was written by James. To determine this, we can use logical inference.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the book was not written by James. This means that the first premise is false, since the book is a mystery novel and James did not write it.\n\nHowever, we are also given that the book is a mystery novel. This means that the second premise is true, regardless of who wrote the book.\n\nTherefore, if the book was not written by James, it must be the case that the book is a mystery novel, but James did not write it. This is a logical contradiction, since we have assumed that the book was not written by James, but it is still a mystery novel.\n\nHence, our assumption that the book was not written by James must be false, and it must be the case that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
