The statement \"The wumble must be gronk for a flibbit and it must be zooble\" is true.\n2. The first clause of the statement is \"The wumble must be gronk for a flibbit.\"\n3. This clause implies that the wumble must be gronk for some entity, which we will call \"a flibbit.\"\n4. The second clause of the statement is \"it must be zooble.\"\n5. This clause implies that whatever the wumble is gronk for, it must also be zooble.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the wumble must be gronk for a flibbit and zooble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
