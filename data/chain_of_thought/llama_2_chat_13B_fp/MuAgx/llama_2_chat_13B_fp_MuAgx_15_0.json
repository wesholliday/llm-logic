This suggests that the author may be using repetition to emphasize a particular point or idea.\n\nFurthermore, the word 'must' implies a sense of necessity or obligation, which suggests that the author is trying to convey a specific requirement or expectation.\n\nBased on these observations, it is possible to infer that the author is trying to convey the idea that something (represented by 'the frozz') must be done in a particular way (represented by 'zooble quimble plonk') and that this something must also involve plimping a quimble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
