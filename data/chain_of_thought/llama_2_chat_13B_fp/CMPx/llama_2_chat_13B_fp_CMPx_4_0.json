    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle, since they are the only other candidates.\n\nWe also know that the crinel is likely to be named snarggle, so it's unlikely that the nafiz will be named snarggle. This means that if the crinel isn't named snarggle, it's likely that the nafiz won't be named snarggle either.\n\nNow, the question is whether it's likely that the tomul will be named snarggle if the crinel isn't named snarggle. Since the crinel is unlikely to be named snarggle, and the nafiz is unlikely to be named snarggle if the crinel isn't, it follows that the tomul is unlikely to be named snarggle as well.\n\nAnswer: No",
