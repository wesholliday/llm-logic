    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

We also know that if the foopet isn't the top seller, then the crangor will be. Therefore, we can deduce that if the trundle isn't the top seller, it is likely that the crangor will be.\n\nHowever, we also know that the trundle is likely to lead sales, which means that the foopet is unlikely to be the top seller if the trundle isn't. Therefore, it is not necessary for the crangor to be the top seller if the trundle isn't.\n\nAnswer: No",
