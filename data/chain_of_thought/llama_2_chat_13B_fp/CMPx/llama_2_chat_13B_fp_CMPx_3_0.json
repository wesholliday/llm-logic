    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a tropin, a loment, and a dralid are the top scoring vilcants this season. Experts expect the tropin likely will have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower. These lead the vilcants, so if the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will. Moreover, the tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead in vilcants, the dralid will?",

This means that the tropin and loment are likely to have high vilcant rates, while the dralid is likely to have a lower rate.\n\nWe are also told that if the loment doesn't have the top vilcant rate, then the dralid will. This means that if the loment's vilcant rate is lower than the tropin's, then the dralid's rate will be higher than the loment's.\n\nFinally, we are asked whether it follows that if the tropin doesn't lead in vilcants, the dralid will. To determine this, we need to consider the possibility that the tropin and loment have the same vilcant rate.\n\nAnswer: no",
