    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that the garplex is the most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, and the peedonk has a much lower chance. This means that the probability of the garplex winning is higher than the probability of the beelhet winning, and the probability of the peedonk winning is the lowest.\n\nWe are also given that if the beelhet doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer. This means that if the beelhet has a low probability of winning, then the peedonk has a high probability of winning if the beelhet doesn't win.\n\nFinally, we are told that it is likely that the garplex will become domer, which means that the probability of the garplex winning is high.\n\nUsing this information, we can deduce that the probability of the garplex winning is high, and the probability of the beelhet winning is low. Therefore, it is unlikely that the peedonk will become domer if the garplex doesn't become domer.\n\nAnswer: No",
