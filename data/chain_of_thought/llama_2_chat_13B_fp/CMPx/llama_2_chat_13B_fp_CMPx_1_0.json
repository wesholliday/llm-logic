    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dasetil, a lentum, and a vifali are competing to be this year's batalit. The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

If the lentum isn't the batalit, then the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, it is less likely that the lentum will be the batalit. Therefore, if the dasetil isn't the batalit, it is more likely that the vifali will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
