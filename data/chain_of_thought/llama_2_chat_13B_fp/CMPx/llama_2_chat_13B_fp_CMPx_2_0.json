    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then the sulect will, as there are no other applicants.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the jantiz doesn't get the zulision. In this case, the cramen is likely to get it, as they are the second most qualified applicant. If the cramen gets the zulision, then the sulect will not get it, as there is no one else to consider.\n\nTherefore, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, it is unlikely that the sulect will, as the cramen is likely to get it instead.\n\nAnswer: No",
