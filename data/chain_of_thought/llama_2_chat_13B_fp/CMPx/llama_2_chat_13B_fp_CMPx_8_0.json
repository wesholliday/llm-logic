    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

This means that the trendel has a higher chance of winning than the laxum, and the laxum has a higher chance of winning than the doffen.\n\nWe are also given that if the laxum doesn't win Best Ploggel, then the doffen will win. This means that if the laxum doesn't win, the doffen has a chance to win.\n\nFinally, we are told that the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel, which means that the laxum likely won't win.\n\nUsing this information, we can deduce that if the trendel doesn't win Best Ploggel, it is likely that the doffen will win.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
