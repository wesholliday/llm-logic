    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

This means that if the stribben is selected, the vanoon is likely to be selected as well, as they are the next best candidates.\n\nHowever, if the stribben is not selected, then the vanoon is unlikely to be selected, as the owner may choose the jentapp instead. This is because the jentapp is the only other qualified candidate, and the owner may prefer to choose the most qualified candidate available.\n\nTherefore, if the stribben isn't selected, it is unlikely that the jentapp will be selected, as the owner may choose to select the vanoon instead.\n\nAnswer: No",
