    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

Additionally, we are told that if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then the votal will. This implies that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal has a good chance of doing so.\n\nHowever, we are also told that the fraglen is likely to lead the league, which suggests that it is more probable that the fraglen will lead the league than the votal. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will.\n\nAnswer: No",
