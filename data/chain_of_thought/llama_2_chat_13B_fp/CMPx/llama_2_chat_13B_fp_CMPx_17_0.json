    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that the flinker, dringen, and n\u00fcffen are the top prospects for a breakout season next year, and that the flinker is the most likely to have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen. Additionally, if the dringen does not have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nWe need to determine the likelihood that if the flinker does not have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will. To do this, we can use a series of logical statements based on the information provided:\n\n1. If the flinker has a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will not have a breakout season (since the dringen is an outside shot, and if the dringen does not have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will not have one either).\n2. If the flinker does not have a breakout season, then the dringen is unlikely to have a breakout season (since the flinker is the most likely to have a breakout season, and if they do not, then the dringen is unlikely to).\n3. If the dringen does not have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nUsing these statements, we can conclude that if the flinker does not have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
