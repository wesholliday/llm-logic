    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

Additionally, we are told that if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nWe can start by considering the possibility that the blimfet does not bafwidge the most. If this is the case, then the crongle is expected to bafwidge the most, since it is the next most likely bafwider. However, we are also told that if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most. Therefore, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, it is likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
