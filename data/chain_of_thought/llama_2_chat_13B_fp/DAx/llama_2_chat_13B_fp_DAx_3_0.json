The splat was not morphed.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the splat did not quank. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The splat did not quank\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the splat was not morphed. This means that the first statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" does not apply, as the splat is not morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat quanked.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the splat was not morphed means that we cannot use the first statement to infer that the splat quanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
