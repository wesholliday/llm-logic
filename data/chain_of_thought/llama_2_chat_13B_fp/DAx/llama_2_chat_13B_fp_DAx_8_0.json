The sprocket was not cranked.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the sprocket was not daggled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The sprocket was not daggled\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the sprocket was cranked. If the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled (by the given statement 1). Therefore, if the sprocket was cranked, we can infer that it was daggled.\n\nHowever, we are also given that the sprocket was not cranked. If the sprocket was not cranked, then it cannot be daggled (by the given statement 1). Therefore, if the sprocket was not cranked, we cannot infer that it was not daggled.\n\nIn other words, we can only infer that the sprocket was not daggled if we know that it was not cranked. If we do not know whether the sprocket was cranked or not, we cannot infer anything about its daggledness.\n\nAnswer: no",
