This statement implies that if the smip was shripped (i.e., if the smip was in a certain state), then it must have luped the zoint (i.e., performed a certain action).\n\nThe second statement is 'The smip was not shripped'. This statement implies that the smip was not in the state required for it to lup the zoint.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip did not lup the zoint, because it was not in the required state.\n\nAnswer: no",
