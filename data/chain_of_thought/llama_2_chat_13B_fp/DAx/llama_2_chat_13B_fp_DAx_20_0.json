This means that the surning of the fleeg is contingent upon its blutteredness.\n\nSecondly, the second statement 'The fleeg was not bluttered' indicates that the fleeg was not in a bluttered state.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements together. Since the fleeg was not bluttered, it does not meet the condition specified in the first statement for surning to occur. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nAnswer: no",
