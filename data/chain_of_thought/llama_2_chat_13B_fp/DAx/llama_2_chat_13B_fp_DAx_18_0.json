To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The shank was not nugged\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is true. This means that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nNow, we know that the shank was not plooked, so we can conclude that the shank was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: no",
