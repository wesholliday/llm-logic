The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nThis statement implies that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. In other words, fraggling the zinger is a necessary condition for smoogling it.\n\n2. The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nThis statement tells us that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements:\n\nIf the zinger was not fraggled, then it cannot be smoogled, because fraggling is a necessary condition for smoogling. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
