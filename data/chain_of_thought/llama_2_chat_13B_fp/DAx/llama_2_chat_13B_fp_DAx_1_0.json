This implies a causal relationship between blimming and zargling.\n\nThe second statement 'The flugel was not blimmed' means that the flugel did not undergo the process of blimming.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that the flugel did not undergo the process of zargling, because if it had been blimmed, it would have been zargled. Therefore, we can infer 'The flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
