The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the grommet did not plop the frink. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the grommet was not sploffed. This means that the condition for plopping the frink (i.e., being sploffed) does not hold. Therefore, it is not possible for the grommet to have plopped the frink.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAnswer: No",
