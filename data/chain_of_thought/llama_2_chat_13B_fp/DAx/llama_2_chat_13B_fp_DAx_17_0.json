This means that if the flob was skizzled, it must have moved.\n\nThe second statement \"The flob was not skizzled\" contradicts the first statement, as it asserts that the flob was not skizzled. This means that the flob did not move, as there was no skizzling to cause it to do so.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flob was not movated.\n\nAnswer: no",
