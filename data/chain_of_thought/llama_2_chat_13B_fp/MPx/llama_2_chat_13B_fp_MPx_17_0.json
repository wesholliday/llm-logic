This statement implies that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. However, this statement does not guarantee that the flob was actually skizzled.\n\nNext, we have 'The flob was skizzled'. This statement confirms that the flob was indeed skizzled.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'The flob movated' from these two statements. Since the first statement implies that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved, and the second statement confirms that the flob was skizzled, we can logically infer that the flob movated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
