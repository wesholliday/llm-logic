The premise of the argument is 'If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run.' This is a conditional statement, where the condition is filling up the gas tank and the conclusion is that the car will run.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run.' This conclusion follows logically from the premise, as filling up the gas tank is a necessary condition for the car to run, and the presence of a hole in the gas tank does not negate this necessary condition.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
