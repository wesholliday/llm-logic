However, this statement alone does not provide sufficient information to infer that the project will be completed by Friday.\n\nTo infer that the project might be completed by Friday, we would need additional information about the project's timeline and the amount of work remaining to be completed. Without this information, we cannot determine whether the project will be completed by Friday or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
