However, it does not necessarily mean that the package will be delivered today.\n\nTo infer that the package might be delivered today and signed for, we need to consider additional information. For example, if the statement is made on a day when delivery is typically made, or if there are other indications that the package is ready for delivery, then it is possible to infer that the package might be delivered today and signed for.\n\nAnswer: no",
