However, it does not necessarily mean that the exam will be difficult.\n\nTo infer that the exam might be difficult and cover all chapters, we need to consider additional information or context. For example, if we know that the course is particularly challenging or that the instructor has a history of creating difficult exams, then we might infer that the exam will be difficult and cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer: No.",
