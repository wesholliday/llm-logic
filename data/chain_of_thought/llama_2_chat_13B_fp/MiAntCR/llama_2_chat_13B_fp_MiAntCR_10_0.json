However, it does not necessarily imply that the document has been signed and notarized.\n\nTo infer that the document might be signed and notarized, we need to consider the possibility that the document has been signed in the presence of a notary public, and that the notary public has verified the authenticity of the signatures and confirmed that the document is genuine.\n\nAnswer: no",
