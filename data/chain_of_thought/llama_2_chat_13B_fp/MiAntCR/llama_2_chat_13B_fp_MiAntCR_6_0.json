The fact that the concert might start at 8 PM only indicates that the concert is scheduled to start at that time, and it does not provide any information about the availability of tickets.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the concert might be sold out and start at 8 PM based solely on the statement \"The concert might start at 8 PM.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
