This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the room being cleaned daily or the towels being replaced regularly.\n\nTo infer that the room might be cleaned daily and have fresh towels, we need to consider the possibility that the fresh towels are being provided as part of the daily cleaning service. This is a reasonable inference because it is common for hotels and other accommodations to provide fresh towels as part of their daily cleaning service.\n\nAnswer: yes",
