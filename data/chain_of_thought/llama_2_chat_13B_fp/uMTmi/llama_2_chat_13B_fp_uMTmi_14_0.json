However, the statement also says \"the wolf might not have been in the den,\" which means that the wolf's presence in the den is not certain.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the given statements. The presence of the bear in the cave and the wolf in the den are not mutually exclusive, and we cannot rule out the possibility that both animals were present in their respective locations.\n\nAnswer: no",
