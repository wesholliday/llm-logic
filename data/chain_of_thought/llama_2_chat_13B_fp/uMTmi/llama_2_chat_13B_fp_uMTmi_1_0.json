            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well. However, the second part of the statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Sue was not present at the wedding, even if Mary was.\n\nTo infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these statements would be a logical fallacy. The fact that Sue might not have been at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was not there. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
