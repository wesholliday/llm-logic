This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice is constrained to pasta.\n\nThe second statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" means that Bob might have chosen something else other than pasta. This means that Bob's choice is not limited to pasta, and he has other options.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, which means that Bob's choice is constrained to pasta. However, Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means that Bob has other options. This implies that Sue did not choose pizza, because if she did, Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
