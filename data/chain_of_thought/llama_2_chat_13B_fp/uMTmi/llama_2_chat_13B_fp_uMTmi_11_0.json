If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, the statement also includes the phrase \"the muffins might not have been blueberry,\" which suggests that there is a possibility that the muffins may not have been blueberry, even if the cake was chocolate.\n\nTo infer that the cake was not chocolate, we would need additional information or evidence. The fact that the muffins might not have been blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate. It is possible that the muffins could have been a different type of muffin entirely, or that they could have been blueberry but not necessarily because the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
