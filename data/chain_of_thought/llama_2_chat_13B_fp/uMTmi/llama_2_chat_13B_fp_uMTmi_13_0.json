However, the statement also includes the phrase \"might not have been blue,\" which suggests that the truck's color is not necessarily determined by the car's color.\n\nTo infer that the car was not red, we would need additional information or evidence that the car was not red. The statement alone does not provide sufficient reason to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
