However, the statement also says \"Amy might not have played tennis,\" which means that it is possible that Amy did not play tennis even if Jeff played basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement to determine if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. If we assume that Jeff played basketball, then we know that Amy must have played tennis. However, the statement also says that Amy might not have played tennis, which means that it is possible that Amy did not play tennis even if Jeff played basketball. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that Jeff did not play basketball based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
