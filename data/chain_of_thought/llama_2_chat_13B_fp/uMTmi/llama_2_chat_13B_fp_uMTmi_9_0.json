This is because the two shirts are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one person buys one shirt, the other person cannot buy the other shirt.\n\nThe second part of the statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" indicates that there is a possibility that Mark did not purchase the blue shirt, even if Lisa did buy the red shirt. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
