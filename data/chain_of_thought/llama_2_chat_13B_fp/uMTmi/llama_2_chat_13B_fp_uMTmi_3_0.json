However, the second part of the statement \"Also, the book might not be a mystery novel\" suggests that James might not have written the book, even if it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on the given statements. The first statement implies that James only writes mystery novels, but the second statement suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel, which means that James might have written the book even if it is not a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was not written by James.",
