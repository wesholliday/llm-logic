However, the statement also says that Jen might not have watched basketball, which means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball even if Tom watched football.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the statement, \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, even if Tom watched football. This implies that the fact that Tom watched football does not necessarily mean that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
