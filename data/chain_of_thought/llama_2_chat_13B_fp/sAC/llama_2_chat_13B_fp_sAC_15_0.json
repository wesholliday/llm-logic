Erin took a train.\n\nWe need to determine whether it follows that Sam took a plane. To do this, we can use logical inference to deduce the conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's assume that Sam took a plane. This means that Erin took a train, since the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nNow, we know that Erin took a train, so we can deduce that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
