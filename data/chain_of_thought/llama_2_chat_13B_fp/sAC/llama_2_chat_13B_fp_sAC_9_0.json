Mark bought the blue shirt (assuming this is true)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Lisa bought the red shirt. To determine this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" based on the given premises.\n\nLet's analyze the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\":\n\nThis statement is saying that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. In other words, the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa is a sufficient condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we know that Mark did buy the blue shirt, so we can infer that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, we don't know for sure if Lisa actually bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
