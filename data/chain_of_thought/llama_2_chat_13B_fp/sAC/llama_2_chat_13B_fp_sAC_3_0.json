            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the book was written by James. To determine this, we can use logical reasoning to evaluate the premises and see if they entail the conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first premise:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis premise states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book was written by James, then it has certain characteristics that are typical of mystery novels, such as suspense, intrigue, and a puzzle to be solved.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second premise:\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis premise states that the book is a mystery novel, which means that it has the characteristics mentioned above.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the book was written by James. This is because the first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, and the second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, since the book is a mystery novel, it must have been written by James.\n\nIn other words, the two premises together entail the conclusion that the book was written by James. This is a logical deduction based on the information provided, and it is the correct answer to the question.",
