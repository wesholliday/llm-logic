The truck was metal.\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the doll was plastic. To determine this, we need to evaluate the truth of the conditional statement:\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nSince the truck was metal, we know that the conditional statement is true. This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal.\n\nNow, we are given that the truck was metal, so we can conclude that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal. But we are not given that the doll was plastic, so we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No",
