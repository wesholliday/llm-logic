The robot visited Jupiter (premise)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the alien visited Mars. To determine this, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\n\nThis premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that if the robot visited Jupiter, it is because the alien visited Mars.\n\n2. The robot visited Jupiter\n\nThis premise states that the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's combine the premises:\n\nIf the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (premise 1)\nThe robot visited Jupiter (premise 2)\n\nWe can conclude that if the robot visited Jupiter, it is because the alien visited Mars. In other words, if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
