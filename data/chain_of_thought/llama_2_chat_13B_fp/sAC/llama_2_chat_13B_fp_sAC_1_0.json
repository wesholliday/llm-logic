            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (assuming this is true)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (this is given as true)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Mary was at the wedding. To determine this, we can use logical inference to draw a conclusion based on the premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n\"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nThis premise is saying that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding. It is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Mary attending the wedding\" and the conclusion is \"Sue attending the wedding\".\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n\"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nThis premise is saying that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nNow, let's put the two premises together and see if we can draw a conclusion about Mary:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding (condition), then Sue was at the wedding (conclusion)\nSue was at the wedding (given)\n\nCan we conclude that Mary was at the wedding?\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the premises, we can see that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. However, the second premise tells us that Sue was at the wedding, so it follows that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be there too. But this does not directly tell us whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo",
