Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand. This statement tells us that the notebook is not currently located on the nightstand. However, it does not provide any information about the location of the notebook.\n2. Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand. This statement tells us that the notebook is either in the drawer or it is located on the nightstand. However, it does not provide any information about the location of the notebook.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The notebook is in the drawer and not sitting on the nightstand. This combination is possible, as the notebook could be in the drawer and not on the nightstand.\n\nCombination 2: The notebook is sitting on the nightstand. This combination is not possible, as we were told that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer. The statements do not provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
