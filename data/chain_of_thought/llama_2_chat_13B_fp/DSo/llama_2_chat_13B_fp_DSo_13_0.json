Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the toy is in the toy box based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the toy is not sitting on the shelf. This means that the toy cannot be sitting on the shelf, which implies that it must be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf. This means that if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. We know that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, and we know that it must be either in the toy box or sitting on the shelf. Since we have already established that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
