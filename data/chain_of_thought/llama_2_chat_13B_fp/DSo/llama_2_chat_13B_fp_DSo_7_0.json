To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" - This statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet. However, it does not provide any information about the car.\n2. \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet\" - This statement tells us that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet. However, it does not provide any information about the car.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the umbrella is not in the closet, and it is either in the car or in the closet. This means that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
