Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys are either in the drawer or they are not in the cabinet at all.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the keys are either in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet. This means that if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (as per Statement 1), then they must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's combine both statements:\n\nIf the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (Statement 1), and they are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet (Statement 2), then we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
