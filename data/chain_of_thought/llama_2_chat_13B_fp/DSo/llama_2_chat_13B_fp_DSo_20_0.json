To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can deduce the location of the sunglasses.\n\nFirst, we know that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, so we can eliminate that possibility. This means that the sunglasses must be in her bag or somewhere else.\n\nSecond, we are told that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the sunglasses are perched on her head, we can conclude that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
