Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. To do this, we need to determine whether the scarf is draped on the coat rack or not.\n\nIf the scarf is draped on the coat rack, then it cannot be stuffed in my backpack, as it is already draped on the coat rack. Therefore, if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nNow, we know that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack, so we can conclude that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
