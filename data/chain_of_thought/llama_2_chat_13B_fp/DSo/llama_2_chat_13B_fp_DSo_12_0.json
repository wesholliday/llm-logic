The second statement 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet' states that the jacket is either draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n\nSince the jacket is not in the closet, it must be either draped over the chair or it is not in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
