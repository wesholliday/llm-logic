Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the remote control is on the coffee table. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\nThis statement tells us that the remote control is not hidden under the couch. However, it does not provide any information about the location of the remote control.\n\n2. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nThis statement tells us that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hidden under the couch. However, it does not provide any information about the location of the remote control.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the remote control is not hidden under the couch, and it is either on the coffee table or hidden under the couch. This means that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
