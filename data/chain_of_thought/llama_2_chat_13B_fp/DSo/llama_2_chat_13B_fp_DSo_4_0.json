'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom' implies that the cat is not in the bedroom, but it does not necessarily mean that the cat is napping on the couch.\n2. 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom' implies that the cat is either napping on the couch or it is in the bedroom.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements using logical inference. Since the cat is not in the bedroom, it must be either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. However, we know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, so the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
