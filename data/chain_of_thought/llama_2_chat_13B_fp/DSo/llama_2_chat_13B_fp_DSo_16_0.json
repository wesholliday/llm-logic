The second statement 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk' implies that the pen can either be in the bag or on the desk.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can deduce that if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag. In other words, if the pen is not present on the desk, it must be present in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
