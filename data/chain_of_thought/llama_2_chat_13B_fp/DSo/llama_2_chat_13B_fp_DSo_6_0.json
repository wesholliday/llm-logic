'The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen' implies that the phone is not present in the kitchen.\n2. 'Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen' implies that the phone is either in the living room or it is not present in the kitchen (i.e., it is not ringing in the kitchen).\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nIf the phone is not present in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room (since it cannot be both in the kitchen and not ringing).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The phone is in the living room'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
