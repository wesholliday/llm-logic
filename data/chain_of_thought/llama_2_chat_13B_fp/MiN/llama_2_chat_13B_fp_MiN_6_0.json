This means that we cannot infer with certainty that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Sue might not have chosen pizza means that we cannot rule out the possibility that she did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\".\n\nAnswer: no",
