It does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest, but rather that we cannot be certain of its presence.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest,\" we need to consider the possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest at all. If the griffin was not in the forest, then it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
