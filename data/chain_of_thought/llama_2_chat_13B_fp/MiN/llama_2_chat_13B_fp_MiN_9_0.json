This means that we cannot infer with certainty that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the absence of evidence (i.e., the fact that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt) does not prove the existence of the opposite (i.e., that Lisa must have bought the red shirt).\n\nAnswer: no",
