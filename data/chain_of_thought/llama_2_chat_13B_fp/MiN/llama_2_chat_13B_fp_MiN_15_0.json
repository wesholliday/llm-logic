However, it does not necessarily follow that the shoes must not be in the closet.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet,\" we would need additional information or context to rule out the possibility that the shoes are in the closet. For example, if we know that the closet is locked and the shoes are not there, then we could infer that the shoes must not be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: no",
