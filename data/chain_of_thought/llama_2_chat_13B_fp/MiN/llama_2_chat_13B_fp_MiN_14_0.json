This implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" from the statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\".\n\nAnswer: no",
