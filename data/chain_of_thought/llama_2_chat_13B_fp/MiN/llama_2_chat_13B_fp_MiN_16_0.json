It does not necessarily mean that the pen is not in my bag.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag,\" we need to consider the possibility that the pen might not be in my bag. If the pen is not in my bag, then it is not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" from \"The pen might not be in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
