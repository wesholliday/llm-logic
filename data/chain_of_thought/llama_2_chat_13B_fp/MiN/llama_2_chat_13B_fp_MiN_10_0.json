In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily prove the opposite.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside,\" we need to consider the possibility that the dog was not inside and the fact that we have no evidence to suggest that it was inside. This inference is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside\" based on the fact that we have no evidence to suggest that the dog was inside, and the possibility that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
