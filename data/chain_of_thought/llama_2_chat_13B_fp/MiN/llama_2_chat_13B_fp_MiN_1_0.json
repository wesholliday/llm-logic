This means that we cannot infer with certainty that Mary was present at the wedding. In other words, the absence of Mary at the wedding is a possibility, and we cannot rule out this possibility based on the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" from the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: no",
