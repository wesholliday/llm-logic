The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nWe want to infer whether the alien did not visit Mars based on these two statements. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The alien did not visit Mars\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the alien visited Mars. Then, according to statement 1, the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, statement 2 tells us that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means that there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter, even if the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on these two statements alone. The relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter is not sufficient to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
