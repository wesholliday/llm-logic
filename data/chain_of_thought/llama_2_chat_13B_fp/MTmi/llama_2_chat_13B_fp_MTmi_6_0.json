Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nThis statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. It does not explicitly state that Sue chose pizza, but it implies that she did.\n\nStatement 2: Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nThis statement suggests that Bob might not have chosen pasta, but it does not rule out the possibility that he did choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these two statements. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, and Bob might not have chosen pasta. These two statements are contradictory, which means that they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on these two statements alone. The statements are contradictory, and we cannot logically deduce anything about Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
