The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book was not written by James. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can deduce that the book was not written by James.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement implies that if James wrote the book, then the book must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then James did not write it.\n\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel, but it does not necessarily mean that James did not write it.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together and see if we can deduce that the book was not written by James.\n\nIf the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, we are told that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that the book might not be a mystery novel even if James wrote it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the book was not written by James based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
