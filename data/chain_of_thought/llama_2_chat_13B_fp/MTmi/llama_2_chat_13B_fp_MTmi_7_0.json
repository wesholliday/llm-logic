Chris might not have finished the face.\n\nWe want to infer whether Alex did not finish the race. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" given the information that Chris might not have finished the face.\n\nLet's assume that Alex finished the race. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, since the premise of the statement is that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris did finish the face.\n\nHowever, we are also given that Chris might not have finished the face. This means that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the face, even if Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
