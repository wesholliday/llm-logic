The pants might not have been denim.\n\nWe want to infer whether the shirt was not cotton. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the pants being denim given that the shirt was cotton.\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, the pants would definitely be denim. However, the second statement tells us that the pants might not have been denim. This means that even if the shirt was cotton, there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
