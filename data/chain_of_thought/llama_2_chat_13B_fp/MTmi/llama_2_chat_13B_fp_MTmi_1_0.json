Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nWe want to infer whether Mary was not at the wedding. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that Mary was at the wedding. Then, according to statement 1, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, statement 2 states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which means that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nIf Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding, since the two statements are linked by the word \"then.\" Therefore, the statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\" is true.\n\nExplanation:\n\nNow, let's answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
