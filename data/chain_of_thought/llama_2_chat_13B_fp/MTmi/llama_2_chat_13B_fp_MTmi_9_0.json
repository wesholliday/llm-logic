            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nLet's assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt. Then, according to statement 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, statement 2 tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, even if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, if we assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can see that the statements \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" are both true. But this would mean that the statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is false, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
