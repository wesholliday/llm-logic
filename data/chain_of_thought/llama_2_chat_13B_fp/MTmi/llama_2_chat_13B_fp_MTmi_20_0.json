The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the apple was not red. To do this, we need to evaluate the consistency of the two statements.\n\nLet's assume that the apple was red. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that the banana could have been any color except yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the banana was not yellow. If the banana was not yellow, then the statement \"The banana must have been yellow\" becomes false. This means that the apple was not red, since the premise of statement 1 is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
