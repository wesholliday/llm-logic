This means that the mummy's awakening is dependent on the vampire's awakening.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. In other words, we are asked to determine if the mummy's awakening causes the vampire's awakening.\n\nTo do this, we need to examine the given information and see if there is any evidence that suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between the mummy's and vampire's awakenings.\n\nAfter carefully examining the given information, we find that there is no evidence to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between the mummy's and vampire's awakenings. The given information only states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not imply that the mummy's awakening causes the vampire's awakening.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
