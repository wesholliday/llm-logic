However, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nThe statement only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but it does not tell us that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. There could be other factors that affect the color of both the apple and the banana, and we cannot assume that the color of one fruit determines the color of the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
