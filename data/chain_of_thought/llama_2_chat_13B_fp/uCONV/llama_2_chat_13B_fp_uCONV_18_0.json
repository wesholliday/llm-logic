This means that there is a direct relationship between the material of the doll and the material of the truck. If the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. To infer this, we need to consider the relationship between the material of the truck and the material of the doll.\n\nIf the truck was metal, then it is possible that the doll was plastic. However, we cannot infer with certainty that the doll was plastic just because the truck was metal. This is because there could be other factors that influence the material of the doll, such as the intended use of the toy or the personal preferences of the child who owns it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. The relationship between the material of the truck and the material of the doll is not sufficient to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
