This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, such as her own personal preference or because she was invited to a basketball game by someone else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: No",
