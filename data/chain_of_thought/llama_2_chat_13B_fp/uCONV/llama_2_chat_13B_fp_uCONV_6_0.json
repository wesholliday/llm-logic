However, this does not necessarily mean that if Bob chose pasta, Sue would have chosen pizza.\n\nThere could be a scenario where Bob chose pasta regardless of what Sue chose. For example, if Bob is a big fan of pasta and always chooses it, then he would have selected pasta regardless of what Sue chose. In this case, Bob's choice of pasta does not rely on Sue's choice at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No",
