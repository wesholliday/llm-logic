This means that the presence of Mary at the wedding implies the presence of Sue at the wedding.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. To answer this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf Sue was at the wedding, then it is possible that Mary was also at the wedding, but it is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding without Mary being present.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. The presence of Sue at the wedding does not guarantee the presence of Mary at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
