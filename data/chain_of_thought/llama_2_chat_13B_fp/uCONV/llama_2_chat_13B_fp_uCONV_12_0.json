This means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nTo infer that Joe went to the park based on the fact that Lucy went to the zoo, we would need additional information or assumptions. For example, if we know that Lucy and Joe are always together when they go out, then we could infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. However, without this additional information, we cannot make the inference that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
