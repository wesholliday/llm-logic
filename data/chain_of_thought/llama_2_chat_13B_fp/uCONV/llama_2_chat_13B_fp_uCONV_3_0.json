Therefore, if the book is a mystery novel, it must have been written by James.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the book is a mystery novel does not mean it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
