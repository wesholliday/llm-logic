To determine this, we need to consider the relationship between Alex and Chris.\n\nLet's assume that Alex finished the race. This means that Chris did not finish the race, because we are told that if Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the race. There could be other reasons why Chris did not finish the race, such as a mechanical failure or a crash.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. The information we are given does not provide enough evidence to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
