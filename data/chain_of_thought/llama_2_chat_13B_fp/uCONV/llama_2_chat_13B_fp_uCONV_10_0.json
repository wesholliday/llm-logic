This means that if the dog is inside the house, the cat must be outside the house.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer that if the cat is outside, then the dog is inside. To infer this, we need to consider the opposite of the original statement.\n\nIf the cat is outside, then the dog must be inside, because if the dog were outside, it would be outside with the cat.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the cat is outside, then the dog is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
