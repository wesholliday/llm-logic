It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing puzzle piece is in the box. To do this, we need to determine whether the two statements are compatible or contradictory.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nThis statement suggests that the missing puzzle piece could be either on the floor or in the box. It does not provide any information about the location of the missing piece.\n\n2. It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nThis statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece cannot be on the floor. If it were on the floor, it would be blending in, according to the first statement. Therefore, the missing piece must be in the box.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the missing puzzle piece cannot be on the floor, and it could be either on the floor or in the box. Therefore, the only possible location for the missing piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
