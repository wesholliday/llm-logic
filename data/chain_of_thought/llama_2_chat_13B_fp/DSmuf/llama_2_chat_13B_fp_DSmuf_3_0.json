It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the keys are in the drawer based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the keys are either in the cabinet or in the drawer. This means that if the keys are not in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nStatement 2 states that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the keys are not in the cabinet (as stated in Statement 2), then they must be in the drawer (as implied by Statement 1). Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
