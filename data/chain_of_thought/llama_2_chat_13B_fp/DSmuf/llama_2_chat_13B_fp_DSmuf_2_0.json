It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is on the shelf. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. This means that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book cannot be on the table.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf (based on Statement 1). And since the book cannot be on the table (based on Statement 2), it follows that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
