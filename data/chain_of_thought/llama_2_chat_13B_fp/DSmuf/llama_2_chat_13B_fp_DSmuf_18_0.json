It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. To do this, we need to determine which of the two statements is true.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nIf this statement is true, then the notebook is indeed sitting on the nightstand. However, we are also given that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand, which means that this statement is false.\n\n1. The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nIf this statement is true, then the notebook is in the drawer. However, we have already established that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand, so it must be in the drawer.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
