It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the milk is on the counter based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the milk is either in the fridge or on the counter.\n\nStatement 2 states that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter (by the transitive property of inclusive disjunction).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
