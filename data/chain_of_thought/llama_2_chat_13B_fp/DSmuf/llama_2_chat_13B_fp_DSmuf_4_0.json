It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cat is napping on the couch. To do this, we need to determine whether the first statement is true or false.\n\nIf the first statement is true, then the cat must be napping on the couch. However, if the first statement is false, then the cat cannot be napping on the couch.\n\nSo, let's assume that the first statement is true. This means that the cat must be playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch. But we know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom (by the second statement), so the only option left is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
