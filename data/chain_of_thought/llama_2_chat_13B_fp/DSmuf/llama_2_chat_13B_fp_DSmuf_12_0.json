It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the jacket is draped over the chair based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the jacket is either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair. This means that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. Since the jacket is not hanging in the closet (according to Statement 2), and it must be either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair (according to Statement 1), then the only possible conclusion is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
