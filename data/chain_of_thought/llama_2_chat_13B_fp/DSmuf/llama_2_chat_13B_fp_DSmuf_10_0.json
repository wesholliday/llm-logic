It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing sock is in the laundry basket. To do this, we can use logical deduction to eliminate the possibility that the missing sock is under the bed, based on statement 2.\n\nSince statement 2 states that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed, we can conclude that the missing sock is not under the bed. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
