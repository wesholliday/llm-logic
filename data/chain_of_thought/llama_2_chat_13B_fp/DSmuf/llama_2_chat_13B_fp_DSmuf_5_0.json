It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar. This means that if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies were in the pantry, they would not be hidden.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar (Statement 1). And if the cookies were in the pantry, they would not be hidden (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
