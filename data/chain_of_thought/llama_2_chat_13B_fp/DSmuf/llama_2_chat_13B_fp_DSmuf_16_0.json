It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the pen is in my bag. To do this, we need to determine which of the two statements is true.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\n\nIf the pen is on my desk, then it cannot be in my bag, so this statement is false.\n\n2. It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nThis statement is saying that the pen cannot be on my desk. If the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag, so this statement is true.\n\nNow that we have determined that the second statement is true, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
