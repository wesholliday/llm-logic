If the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then they cannot be in her bag. Therefore, if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, they must be in her bag.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then it is possible that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
