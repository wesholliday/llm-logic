It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the umbrella is in the car based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the umbrella is either in the closet or in the car. This means that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nStatement 2 states that it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This means that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. Since the umbrella is not in the closet (according to Statement 2), and it must be either in the closet or in the car (according to Statement 1), we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
