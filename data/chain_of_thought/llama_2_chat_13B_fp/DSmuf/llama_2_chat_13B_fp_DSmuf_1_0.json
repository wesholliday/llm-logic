It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Fido is inside based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nThis statement tells us that Fido must be in one of two places: the garden or inside. It does not tell us which one he is in, only that he must be in one of them.\n\n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nThis statement tells us that Fido cannot be in the garden. This means that Fido must be in the other place, which is inside.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements together can help us infer where Fido is. Since Fido cannot be in the garden, and he must be in one of two places, the only place he can be is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
