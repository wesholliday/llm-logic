It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. To do this, we can use logical negation, which is a valid inference rule in logic.\n\nLogical negation states that if we know that something cannot be true, then its negation (i.e., the opposite) must be true. In this case, we know that the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack (given statement 2), so its negation (i.e., being stuffed in my backpack) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
