The word \"grazzle\" is likely a noun or a verb that is related to the floob.\n\nTo infer \"The floob must be grooble or grazzle for a plonk\", we need to consider the possibility that \"grazzle\" might be a synonym for \"grooble\". If \"grazzle\" and \"grooble\" are interchangeable, then we can infer that the floob must be either \"grazzle\" or \"grooble\" in order to be suitable for a plonk.\n\nAnswer: yes",
