'Froodle' is a place where floobs might be found, so it is reasonable to assume that a floob must be inside a froodle. However, it is not necessary for a floob to be on a zibble in order to be in a froodle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The floob must be on the zibble or in the froodle' from 'The floob must be in the froodle' alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
