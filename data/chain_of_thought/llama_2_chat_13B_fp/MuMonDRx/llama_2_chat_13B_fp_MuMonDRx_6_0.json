Additionally, the phrase \"must be\" implies a requirement or necessity, suggesting that the zibber must be in a certain state in order to function correctly.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the zibber in question is not functioning properly and must be in a state of \"bimboozle\" or \"fizzle\" in order to function correctly.\n\nAnswer: yes",
