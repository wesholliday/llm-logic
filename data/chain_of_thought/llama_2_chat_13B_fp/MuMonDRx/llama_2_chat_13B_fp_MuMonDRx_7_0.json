However, the statement does not provide any information about the wibble's ability to be in any other state or condition.\n\nTo infer that the wibble must be wobble or zizz, we would need additional information or context that suggests the wibble can be in a state other than zizz. Without this additional information, we cannot infer that the wibble must be wobble or zizz.\n\nAnswer: no",
