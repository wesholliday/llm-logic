However, the statement does not provide any information about the nature of the fizzle or the relationship between the fizzle and zooble.\n\nTo infer \"The fizzle must be froodle or zizz by zooble\", we would need additional information or context that establishes a connection between the fizzle and froodle. Without this information, we cannot logically infer that the fizzle is froodle or that it is being zizzed by zooble.\n\nAnswer: no",
