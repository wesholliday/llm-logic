This implies that the grooble is not allowed to be anything else other than blimp zibble.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'The grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble'. This statement tells us that the grooble must be either in grazzle or blimp zibble.\n\nBased on the first statement, we know that the grooble is already required to be blimp zibble. Therefore, if we combine the two statements, we can infer that the grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
