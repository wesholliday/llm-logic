It does not provide any information about the snorkel being blimple or zump.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the statement is referring to a specific context or situation where a snorkel is required, we can infer that the snorkel must be either blimple or zump, but not necessarily both. This is because the statement only mentions the snorkel being zump, and does not provide any information about the snorkel being blimple.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the snorkel must be both blimple and zump. The most we can infer is that the snorkel must be either blimple or zump, but not both.\n\nAnswer: no",
