To infer that the quank must be grazzle or zump, we need to consider the possible meanings of the word \"quank.\"\n\nOne possible meaning of \"quank\" is a type of grazzle, which is a creature known for its ability to zump. In this case, the statement \"The quank must be zump\" would be true because all grazzles are zumps.
