If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Amy did not play tennis. This means that there is no possibility of Amy playing tennis, so we can conclude that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis. However, since we know that Amy did not play tennis (from Statement 1), we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
