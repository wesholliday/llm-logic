If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, Bob would not have chosen pasta.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of choices:\n\n1. Sue chooses pizza, Bob chooses pasta. (This is not possible since Bob did not choose pasta, according to Statement 1.)\n2. Sue chooses pizza, Bob chooses pizza. (This is not possible since Bob did not choose pizza, according to Statement 1.)\n3. Sue chooses something else, Bob chooses pasta. (This is not possible since Bob did not choose pasta, according to Statement 1.)\n4. Sue chooses something else, Bob chooses pizza. (This is not possible since Bob did not choose pizza, according to Statement 2.)\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that there is no possible combination of choices that satisfies both statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
