If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the vampire was not awake. To do this, we can use a negation of the second premise, which states that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy must not have been awake.\n\nSo, we can infer that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire must not have been awake. But we know that the mummy was not awake (from premise 1), so we can conclude that the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
