If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Sam did not take a plane.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Erin did not take a train, but it does not provide any information about Sam.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin would have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Sam took a plane.\n\nIn this scenario, Erin would have taken a train because of statement 2. However, we know that Erin did not take a train (statement 1). Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: Sam did not take a plane.\n\nIn this scenario, Erin did not take a train (statement 1), and Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
