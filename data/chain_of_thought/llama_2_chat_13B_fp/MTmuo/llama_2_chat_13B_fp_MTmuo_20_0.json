If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the apple was not red. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the apple's color.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nThis statement simply says that it is not necessary for the banana to have been yellow. It does not provide any information about the apple's color.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nThis statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, we know that the banana was not yellow, so we can deduce that the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
