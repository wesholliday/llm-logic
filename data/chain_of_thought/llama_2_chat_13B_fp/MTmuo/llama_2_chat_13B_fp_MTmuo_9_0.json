If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about Lisa's purchase.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it is not possible for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it is not possible for Lisa to have bought the red shirt.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can deduce that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it is not possible for Lisa to have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
