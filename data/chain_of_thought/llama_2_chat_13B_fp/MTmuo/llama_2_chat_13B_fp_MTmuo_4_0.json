If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the robot did not go to Jupiter, and therefore, the alien did not go to Jupiter either, since the robot must have visited Jupiter if the alien did.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien did visit Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter. However, since we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter (from Statement 1), it follows that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nAnswer: No",
