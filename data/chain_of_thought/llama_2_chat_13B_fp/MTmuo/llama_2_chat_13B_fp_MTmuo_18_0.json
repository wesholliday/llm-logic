If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the doll was not plastic. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The doll was not plastic\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\nThis statement means that there is no possibility that the truck was metal. So, if the truck was not metal, then the doll must have been plastic.\n\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nThis statement means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, we know that the truck was not metal, so the doll cannot have been plastic.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\nIf the truck was not metal, then the doll must have been plastic. But we know that the truck was not metal, so the doll must not have been plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
