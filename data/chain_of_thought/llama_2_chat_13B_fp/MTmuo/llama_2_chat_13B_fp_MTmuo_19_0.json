If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Jen did not watch basketball. This means that there is no possibility that Jen watched basketball, so we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. However, since we know that Jen did not watch basketball (from Statement 1), we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
