If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the car was not red based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the truck cannot be blue, but it does not provide any information about the car.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. This means that if the car is red, we can infer that the truck is blue.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If the car is not red, then we cannot infer that the truck is blue based on statement 2, because the truck cannot be blue anyway (according to statement 1).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
