If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Kate did not eat salad. This means that Kate did not have to eat salad, but it does not necessarily mean that she ate something else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have had to eat salad.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If Ben did eat pasta, then Kate would have had to eat salad, but we know that Kate did not eat salad. This means that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
