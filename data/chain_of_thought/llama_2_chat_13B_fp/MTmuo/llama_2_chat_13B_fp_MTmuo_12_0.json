If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Joe did not go to the park.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Joe went to the park.\n\nIn this scenario, Lucy must have gone to the zoo, as per statement 2. However, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, as per statement 1. This means that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nScenario 2: Joe did not go to the park.\n\nIn this scenario, Lucy did not go to the zoo, as per statement 1. Since Joe did not go to the park, there is no need for Lucy to have gone to the zoo.\n\nIn both scenarios, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
