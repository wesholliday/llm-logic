If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Alex did not finish the race.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Chris did not finish the race. This means that Chris did not cross the finish line, and therefore, Alex did not cross the finish line either, since Chris must have finished the race if Alex did.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Alex crossed the finish line, then Chris would have crossed the finish line as well. However, since we know that Chris did not finish the race, it follows that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, and since Chris did not finish the race, it follows that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nAnswer: no",
