If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cake was not chocolate. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the cake.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nThis statement means that it is not necessary for the muffins to have been blueberry. In other words, the muffins could have been any type of muffin, and it is not the case that they must have been blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nThis statement means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then it is necessary that the muffins be blueberry.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry. However, we know that the muffins were not blueberry, so it is not the case that the cake was chocolate. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
