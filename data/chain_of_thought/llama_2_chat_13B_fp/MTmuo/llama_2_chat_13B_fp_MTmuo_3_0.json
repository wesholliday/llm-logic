If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book was not written by James. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the book.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This statement tells us that there is no requirement for the book to be a mystery novel. In other words, the book could be any type of novel, not just a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This statement tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be any other type of novel.\n\nSo, what can we infer from these two statements? Well, if the book was not written by James, then it could be any type of novel, including a mystery novel. However, if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
