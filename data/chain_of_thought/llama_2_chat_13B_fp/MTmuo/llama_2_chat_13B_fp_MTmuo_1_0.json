If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that there is no possibility of Sue being at the wedding.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding as well.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these statements. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding as well, according to statement 2. However, we know that Sue was not at the wedding, according to statement 1. This means that there is no possibility of Mary being at the wedding, since if she were, Sue would have been there as well.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
