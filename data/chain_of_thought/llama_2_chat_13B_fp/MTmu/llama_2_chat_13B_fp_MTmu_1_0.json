It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not. To do this, we can use logical deduction to determine the validity of the statements and their implications.\n\nFirst, let's analyze statement 1:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThis statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well. However, we are also given statement 2, which contradicts this statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze statement 2:\n\nIt's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThis statement directly contradicts statement 1, implying that Sue did not attend the wedding. If Sue did not attend the wedding, then it is not possible for Mary to have attended the wedding, since the two statements are linked by the word \"if.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
