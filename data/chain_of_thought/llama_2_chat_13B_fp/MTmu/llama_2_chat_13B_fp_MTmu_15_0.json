It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Sam took a plane based on these two statements. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Sam did not take a plane\" based on the given information.\n\nLet's assume that Sam did take a plane. Then, according to statement 1, Erin must have taken a train. However, statement 2 tells us that this is not the case. This means that our assumption that Sam took a plane leads to a contradiction, which means that our assumption must be false. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
