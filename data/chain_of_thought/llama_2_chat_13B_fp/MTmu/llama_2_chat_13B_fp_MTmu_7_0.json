It's not the case that Chris must have finished the face.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Alex did not finish the race. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Alex did not finish the race\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that Alex did finish the race. Then, by statement 1, Chris must have finished the race as well. However, by statement 2, it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris did not finish the race, which contradicts the fact that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
