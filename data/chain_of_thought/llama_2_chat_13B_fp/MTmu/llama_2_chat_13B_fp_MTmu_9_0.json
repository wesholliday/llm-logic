            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the conclusion that follows from the two given statements.\n\nLet's analyze the first statement:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark cannot have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark cannot have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together and see if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (From statement 1)\nMark did not buy the blue shirt. (From statement 2)\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
