It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the vampire was not awake. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the first statement is true, i.e., the vampire was awake. Then, according to the second statement, the mummy must not have been awake. This means that the mummy was asleep, which is a contradictory statement to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake, as the two statements together lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nAnswer: no",
