It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book was not written by James. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the book was written by James. Then, according to statement 1, the book must be a mystery novel. However, statement 2 tells us that this is not the case. This means that the book cannot be a mystery novel, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
