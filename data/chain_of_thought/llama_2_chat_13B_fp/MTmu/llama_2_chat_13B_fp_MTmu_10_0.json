It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the dog was not inside. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the conclusion that follows from the premises.\n\nLet's analyze the first premise:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nThis premise implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat cannot be inside. In other words, if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second premise:\n\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nThis premise means that it is not true that the cat must have been outside. In other words, the cat could have been inside or outside, but it is not necessary that the cat must have been outside.\n\nNow, let's put the two premises together and see if we can infer that the dog was not inside:\n\nFrom the first premise, if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. But from the second premise, it is not the case that the cat must have been outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
