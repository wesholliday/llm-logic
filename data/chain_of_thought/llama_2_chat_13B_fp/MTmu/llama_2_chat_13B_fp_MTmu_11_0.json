It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cake was not chocolate. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the first statement is true, i.e., the cake was chocolate. Then, according to the second statement, the muffins must not have been blueberry. This means that the muffins could have been any other flavor except blueberry.\n\nNow, let's assume that the second statement is true, i.e., the muffins must not have been blueberry. This means that the muffins could have been any other flavor, including blueberry. This is a contradiction, as we have already assumed that the muffins must not have been blueberry if the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we have reached a logical contradiction, which means that one of the assumptions must be false. Since we started with two true statements, one of them must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
