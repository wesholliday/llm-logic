It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Ben did not eat pasta. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Ben did not eat pasta\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nThis statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad. However, we are also given that Kate did not eat the salad. Therefore, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n2. It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not true that Kate must have eaten the salad. However, we have already established that Kate did not eat the salad. So, this statement is not relevant to our inference.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the given statements, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta. This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have had to eat the salad, but we know that Kate did not eat the salad. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
