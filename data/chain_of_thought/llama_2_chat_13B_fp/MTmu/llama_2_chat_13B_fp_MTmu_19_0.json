It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Tom did not watch football based on these two statements. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Tom did not watch football\" based on the given information.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThis statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThis statement tells us that it is not true that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that even if Tom watched football, it is not necessary that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together and think about what we can infer:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. But we know that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
