However, it does not provide any information about the snork being blimple.\n\nTo infer that the snork might be blimple or zump, we need to assume that the snork is either blimple or zump. This is a logical extension of the first statement, as both blimple and zump are possible identities of the snork.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The snork might be blimple or zump' from 'The snork might be zump'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
