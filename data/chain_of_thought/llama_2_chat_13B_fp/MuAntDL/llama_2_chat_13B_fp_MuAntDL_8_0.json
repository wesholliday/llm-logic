However, it does not directly imply that the restaurant was closed on Monday.\n\nTo infer that the restaurant was closed on Monday, we need to consider the possibility that the restaurant might have been open for limited hours. If the restaurant was open for limited hours, it is possible that it was open on Monday, but we cannot conclude that it was definitely closed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant was closed on Monday based solely on the statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
