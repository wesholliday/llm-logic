The phrase \"or upstairs\" suggests that the envelope could have been in either the upstairs area or under a bed.\n\nTo infer that the envelope must have been under a bed, we need to consider the possibility that it was not in the upstairs area. If the envelope was not in the upstairs area, then it must have been under a bed, as there is no other place it could have been in the downstairs area.\n\nAnswer: yes",
