Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt. This statement confirms that Mark did, in fact, buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since Mark bought the blue shirt, we know that he must have bought it if Lisa bought the red shirt.
