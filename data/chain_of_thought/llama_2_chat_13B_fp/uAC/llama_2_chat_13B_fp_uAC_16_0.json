The pants were denim.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the shirt was cotton based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nThis statement implies that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants were also made of denim. It does not directly state that the shirt was cotton, but it does suggest that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\n2. The pants were denim.\n\nThis statement directly states that the pants were made of denim.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the pants were denim, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim. However, we also know that the pants were denim, regardless of the material of the shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
