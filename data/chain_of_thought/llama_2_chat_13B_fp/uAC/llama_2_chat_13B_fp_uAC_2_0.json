The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the griffin was in the forest based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThis statement implies that if the griffin was present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest. This means that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn would definitely be in the forest.\n\n2. The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThis statement simply states that the unicorn was present in the forest.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if we can infer that the griffin was in the forest:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (based on statement 1).\n\nWe know that the unicorn was in the forest (based on statement 2).\n\nTherefore, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would be in the forest, and we know that the unicorn was in the forest. This means that we can infer that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
