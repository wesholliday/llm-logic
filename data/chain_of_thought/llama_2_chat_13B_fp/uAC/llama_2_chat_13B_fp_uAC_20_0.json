The banana was yellow.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the apple was red based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow. It establishes a conditional relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color.\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThis statement confirms that the banana has the color yellow.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the banana was yellow, and the statement 1 implies that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow, we can infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
