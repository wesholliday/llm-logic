Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Joe went to the park based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo. This statement confirms that Lucy did go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since Lucy went to the zoo, and the first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, we can infer that Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
