The truck was blue.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the car was red based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nThis statement implies that if the car was red, then the truck must be blue. It establishes a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\n2. The truck was blue.\n\nThis statement confirms that the truck is indeed blue.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If the car was red, then the truck would be blue, and since the truck is blue, it means that the car must have been red.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
