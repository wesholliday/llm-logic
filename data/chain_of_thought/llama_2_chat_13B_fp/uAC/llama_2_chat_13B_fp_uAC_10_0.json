The cat was outside.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the dog was inside based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nThis statement implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside. It does not guarantee that the dog was inside, but it does suggest that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nStatement 2: The cat was outside.\n\nThis statement confirms that the cat was indeed outside.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the cat was outside, and the first statement suggests that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
