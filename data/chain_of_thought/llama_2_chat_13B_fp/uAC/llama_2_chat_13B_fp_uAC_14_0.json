The wolf was in the den.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the bear was in the cave based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This statement implies that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n2. The wolf was in the den. This statement confirms that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the wolf was in the den, and the wolf was only in the den if the bear was in the cave, we can infer that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
