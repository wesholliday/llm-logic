The muffins were blueberry.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the cake was chocolate based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins would not have been blueberry.\n\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement tells us that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the muffins were blueberry, we know that the cake was not chocolate, because if it was chocolate, the muffins would not have been blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
