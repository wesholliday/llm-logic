The truck was metal.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the doll was plastic based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThis statement implies that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal. It does not imply that the doll is actually made of plastic.\n\nStatement 2: The truck was metal.\n\nThis statement tells us that the truck is indeed made of metal.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the truck is made of metal, we can infer that the doll is not made of metal (because if it was, the truck would not be made of metal). However, we cannot infer that the doll is made of plastic based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
