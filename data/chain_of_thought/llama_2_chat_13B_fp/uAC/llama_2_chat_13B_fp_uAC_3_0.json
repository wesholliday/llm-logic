The book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the book was written by James based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement implies that there is a direct relationship between James writing the book and the book being a mystery novel. In other words, if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel, regardless of who wrote it.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these two statements. Since the book is a mystery novel, we know that it satisfies the condition of statement 1. Therefore, if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
