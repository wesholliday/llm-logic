Sue was at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding. This statement confirms that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. Since Sue attended the wedding, we know that if Mary attended the wedding, Sue would have attended the wedding as well. In other words, if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have been at the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
