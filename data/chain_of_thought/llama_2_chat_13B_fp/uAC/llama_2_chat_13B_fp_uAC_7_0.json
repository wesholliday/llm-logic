Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race. This statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since Chris finished the race, we know that Alex must have also finished the race, because if Alex had not finished the race, then Chris would not have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
