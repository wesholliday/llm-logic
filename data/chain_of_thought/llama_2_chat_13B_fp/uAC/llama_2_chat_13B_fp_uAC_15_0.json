Erin took a train.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Sam took a plane based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\nThis statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. It does not guarantee that Sam took a plane, but it does establish a conditional relationship between the two.\n\nStatement 2: Erin took a train.\nThis statement confirms that Erin did, in fact, take a train.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since Erin took a train, and the first statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, we can infer that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
