            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled', we need to analyze the given sentence 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nFirstly, we can identify that 'sneg' is the subject of the sentence, and 'crampled' and 'sproted' are two verbs associated with it.\n\nNow, let's focus on the meaning of the sentence. The sentence suggests that if the sneg is crampled, then it will sproted the frink. This implies that cramping the sneg leads to sproting the frink.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the logic of the given sentence. If the sneg did not sproted the frink, it means that the sneg was not crampled. This is because cramping the sneg is a necessary condition for sproting the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
