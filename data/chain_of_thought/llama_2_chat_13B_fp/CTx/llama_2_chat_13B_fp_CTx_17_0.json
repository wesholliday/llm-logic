This means that the flob's skizzling is a necessary condition for it to move.\n\nTherefore, if the flob did not move (i.e., did not 'movate'), then it is not skizzled. This is because the flob's skizzling is a necessary condition for it to move, and since it did not move, it is not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
