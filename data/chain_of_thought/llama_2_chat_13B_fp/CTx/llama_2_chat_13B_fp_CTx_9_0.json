This means that if the condition is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the condition: 'the twonk was not plinked'. If the twonk was not plinked, then the conclusion 'it was varnished' cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that if the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
