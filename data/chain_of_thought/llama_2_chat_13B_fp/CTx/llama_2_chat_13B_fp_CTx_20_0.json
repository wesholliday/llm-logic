            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered', we need to carefully analyze the given statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'.\n\nFirstly, we can observe that the statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, where the condition is 'If the fleeg was bluttered' and the consequence is 'then it surned'. This implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the statement. If the fleeg did not surn, then we can infer that it was not bluttered. This is because, if the fleeg was not bluttered, it would not have surned, as the statement only applies to bluttered fleegs.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
