In other words, if something is slogged, it must also be tragged.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\", we need to use logical reasoning. If the glip was not tragged, then it cannot be slogged, because there is no direct relationship between the two.\n\nAnswer: no",
