However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the shank was not nugged, it does not necessarily mean that it was not plooked.\n\nFor example, if the shank was not plooked, it could be because the person who was supposed to plook it forgot to do so, or because the shank was not eligible for plooking due to some reason. In such cases, the shank would not be nugged, but it would still be considered as not plooked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: No",
