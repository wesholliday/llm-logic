In other words, if something is blimmed, it must also be zargled.\n\nTo infer \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\", we need to consider the logical implications of the original statement. If the flugel was not zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, because being blimmed is a necessary condition for being zargled.\n\nTherefore, if the flugel was not zargled, it must not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
