In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, then it must also be daggled.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\", we need to negate the premise \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\". This can be done by reversing the logical order of the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
