            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nFirstly, we can observe that the statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, where the condition is 'the fribble was snurgled' and the consequence is 'the fribble crinked'.\n\nNow, if we reverse the condition and the consequence, we can form a new statement 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nThis new statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as the absence of crinkling implies that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
