In other words, if something is blummed, it must also be zimmed.\n\nTo infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\", we need to consider the logical implications of the original statement. If the flug was not zimmed, then it cannot be blummed, because being blummed implies being zimmed. Therefore, if the flug was not zimmed, it must not be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
