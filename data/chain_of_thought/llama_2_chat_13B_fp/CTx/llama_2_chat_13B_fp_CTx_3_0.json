In other words, if something is morphed, it will quank.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\", we need to use logical reasoning. If the splat did not quank, then it is not possible that it was morphed, because if it was morphed, it would have quanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
