In other words, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\", we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement. If the dreb was not spened, then it cannot be vroombed, because being vroombed is a necessary condition for being spened.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
