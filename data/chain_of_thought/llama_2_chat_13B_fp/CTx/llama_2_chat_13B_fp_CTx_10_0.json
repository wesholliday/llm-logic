            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition is 'sproinged' and the conclusion is 'garpled'. This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nNow, we want to infer the opposite statement, i.e., if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged. To do this, we need to negate the conclusion of the original statement.\n\nSo, the negation of the original statement is 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
