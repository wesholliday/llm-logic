This implies that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have snugged.\n\nNow, if we negate the condition 'the clug was fleeked', we get 'the clug was not fleeked'. In this case, the consequence 'the clug snugged' does not hold true. Therefore, we can infer that if the clug did not snugged, then it was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
