Sue was at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well. It establishes a direct relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's attendance.\n\nStatement 2: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement simply states that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can logically conclude based on these two statements. If we combine the two statements, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this does not directly imply that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTo conclude that Mary was at the wedding, we need additional information or evidence. Based on the given statements alone, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
