If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n2. Bob chose pasta\n\nWe can start by assuming that Bob chose pasta, and see if we can deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nIf Bob chose pasta, then the first statement implies that Sue did not choose pizza, because if she had chosen pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta.
