Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris would not have finished the race either.\n\nStatement 2: Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. (This is true because Alex did not finish the race, so Chris did not finish the race either.)\n\nChris finished the race. (This is true because we are given that Chris finished the race.)\n\nBased on these two statements, we can logically conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
