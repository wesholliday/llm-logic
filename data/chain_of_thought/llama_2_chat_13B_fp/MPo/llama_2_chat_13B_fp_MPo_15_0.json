To infer 'Erin took a train', we need to determine if the conditional statement is valid and if its antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the conditional statement is logically valid. A conditional statement is logically valid if its antecedent and consequent are contradictory. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane' and the consequent is 'Erin took a train'. We can see that these two statements are not contradictory, so the conditional statement is not logically valid.\n\nNext, we need to check if the antecedent is true. If the antecedent is true, then we can infer that the consequent is likely to be true as well. In this case, we are given that 'Sam took a plane', which is the antecedent of the conditional statement. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent 'Erin took a train' is likely to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'Erin took a train'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
