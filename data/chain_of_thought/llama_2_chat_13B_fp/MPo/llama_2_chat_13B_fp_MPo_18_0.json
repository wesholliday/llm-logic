            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The truck was metal' from 'The doll was plastic' and 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe first statement 'The doll was plastic' is a premise, and the second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement. To infer 'The truck was metal', we need to determine if the conditional statement is valid and if its antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true.\n\nLet's analyze the conditional statement:\n\n'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'\n\nThis statement is a hypothetical statement, and its antecedent (the doll being plastic) is a premise. The consequent (the truck being metal) is the conclusion we want to draw.\n\nTo determine if the conditional statement is valid, we need to evaluate the truth table:\n\n| Doll | Truck |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plastic | Metal |\n| \u2717 | \u2717 |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conditional statement is valid, meaning that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true. The given statement 'The doll was plastic' indicates that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the valid conditional statement and the true antecedent, we can infer 'The truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
