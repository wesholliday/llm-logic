If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Chris finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Alex finished the race. This statement simply tells us that Alex completed the race.\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement implies that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical relationship between these two statements. If Alex finished the race, then it means that Chris finished the race, because the second statement says so. In other words, the second statement is a direct consequence of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race based on the fact that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
