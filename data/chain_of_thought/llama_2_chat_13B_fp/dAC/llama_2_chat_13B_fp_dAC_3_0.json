The book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether the book was written by James. To do this, we can use logical reasoning to determine if the premises imply the conclusion.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis premise states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis premise states that the book is a mystery novel, period. It does not provide any information about who wrote the book.\n\nNow, let's think about how these premises might imply the conclusion. If the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by someone. Since we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, we can deduce that James wrote the book.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that we can deduce from the premises is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
