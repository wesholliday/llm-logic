            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether the vampire was awake based on these premises. To do this, we need to use logical reasoning to determine if the premises imply the conclusion.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This premise establishes a causal relationship between the vampire's awakening and the mummy's awakening.\n2. The mummy was awake. This premise simply states that the mummy is awake.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can deduce from these premises. If the mummy is awake, then we know that the vampire must also be awake, based on the first premise. This is because the first premise establishes a causal relationship between the vampire's awakening and the mummy's awakening.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
