            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether Lisa bought the red shirt based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. It does not directly state that Lisa bought the red shirt, but it implies it.\n\nStatement 2: Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement confirms that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can deduce from these two statements. If we combine the two statements, we can infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had not bought the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
