            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The pants were denim.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether the shirt was cotton. To do this, we need to determine if the first premise is true given the second premise.\n\nLet's assume that the second premise is true, i.e., the pants were denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would also be denim.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the first premise is true given the second premise. In other words, we need to determine if the shirt was cotton given that the pants were denim.\n\nTo do this, we can use logical inference. We know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim. Therefore, if the pants are denim, it is likely that the shirt was cotton.\n\nHowever, we cannot deduce with certainty that the shirt was cotton based solely on the two premises. This is because there could be other possible explanations for why the pants are denim, such as the fact that the person was wearing a denim jacket or that the pants were made of a different material altogether.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce 'The shirt was cotton' based on the two premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
