            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce 'Joe went to the park' from the premises 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' together with 'Lucy went to the zoo', we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe first premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the conclusion (Lucy went to the zoo) depends on the truth of the antecedent (Joe went to the park).\n\nThe second premise 'Lucy went to the zoo' is a straightforward statement that simply asserts the fact that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (conditional statement)\n2. Lucy went to the zoo. ( straightforward statement)\n\nTo deduce 'Joe went to the park' from these premises, we need to establish a logical connection between the two premises. In other words, we need to show that the truth of the second premise (Lucy went to the zoo) logically follows from the truth of the first premise (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called modus ponens, which allows us to deduce the conclusion (Joe went to the park) from the premises. Modus ponens is a valid logical rule that states that if a conditional statement (if A, then B) is true, and the antecedent A is true, then the conclusion B must be true.\n\nApplying modus ponens to our argument, we can deduce 'Joe went to the park' as follows:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (conditional statement)\n2. Lucy went to the zoo. (straightforward statement)\n3. Therefore, Joe went to the park. (deduction using modus ponens)\n\nAnswer: yes",
