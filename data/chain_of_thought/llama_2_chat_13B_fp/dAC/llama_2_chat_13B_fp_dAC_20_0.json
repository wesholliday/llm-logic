            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce 'The apple was red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' together with 'The banana was yellow', we need to evaluate the logical implications of these statements.\n\nFirst, we can deduce 'The banana was yellow' from the premise 'The banana was yellow'. This is a straightforward deduction, as the statement 'The banana was yellow' simply asserts that the banana had the property of being yellow.\n\nNext, we can deduce 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' from the premise 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This deduction relies on the fact that the word 'if' indicates a conditional relationship between the two statements. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nNow, we can try to deduce 'The apple was red' from these premises. To do this, we need to use the transitive property of logic, which states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A is true. In this case, we have 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', and we know that 'The banana was yellow' is true. Therefore, we can deduce 'The apple was red' using the transitive property of logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
