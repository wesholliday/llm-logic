This statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. In other words, the choice of Sue determines the choice of Bob.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'Bob chose pasta'. This statement tells us that Bob did choose pasta.\n\nSo, putting these two statements together, we can deduce that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza, because the choice of Bob is determined by the choice of Sue.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
