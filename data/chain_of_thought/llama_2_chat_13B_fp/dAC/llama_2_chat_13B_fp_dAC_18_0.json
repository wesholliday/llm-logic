This statement is a fact, and it does not imply anything about the doll.\n\nSecond, we have 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This statement implies that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal. However, since we know that the truck is already metal, we can deduce that the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can deduce 'The doll was plastic' is false, and the correct answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no",
