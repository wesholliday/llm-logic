Amy played tennis.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether Jeff played basketball. To do this, we need to use logical reasoning to determine if the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThis statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. It does not explicitly state that Jeff played basketball, but it implies that he did.\n\n2. Amy played tennis.\n\nThis statement tells us that Amy did play tennis.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements together. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. And we know that Amy did play tennis. Therefore, we can deduce that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
