Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to deduce whether Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. This is because the \"if\" clause implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Alex finishing the race and Chris finishing the race.\n\nStatement 2: Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can deduce from these two statements. If we combine the two statements, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and we know that Chris did finish the race. Therefore, we can deduce that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
