This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have eaten salad.\n\nSecond, we know that 'Kate ate salad'. This means that Kate did eat salad.\n\nNow, we can use logical reasoning to deduce 'Ben ate pasta'. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have eaten salad, and we know that Kate did eat salad. Therefore, we can deduce that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
