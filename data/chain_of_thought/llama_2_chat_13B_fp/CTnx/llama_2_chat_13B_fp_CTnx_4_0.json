In other words, if the fribble is snurgled, then it cannot be crinkled.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\", we need to consider the logical implications of the original statement. If the fribble crinkles, then it cannot be snurgled, because snurgling and crinkling are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the fribble crinkles, it must not have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
