This means that surning is not possible for bluttered fleegs.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\" This statement is saying that if the fleeg surned, then it must not have been bluttered.\n\nBased on the first statement, we know that bluttered fleegs cannot surn. So, if the fleeg surned, then it must not have been bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that if the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
