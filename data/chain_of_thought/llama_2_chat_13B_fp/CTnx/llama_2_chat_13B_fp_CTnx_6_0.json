This means that if the grommet was sploffed, it is not possible for it to have plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\". This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the order of the conditions reversed.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the grommet plopped the frink, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed, because if it was sploffed, it would not have been able to plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
