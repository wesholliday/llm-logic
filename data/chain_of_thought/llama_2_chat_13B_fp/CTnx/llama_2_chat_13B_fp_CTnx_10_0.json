This means that if the wug is sproinged, then it is not garpled.\n\nNow, to infer the opposite statement, we need to reverse the condition and consequence. So, the opposite statement would be 'If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
