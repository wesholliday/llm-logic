This implies a logical negation relationship between the two states.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the flugel was zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, and vice versa. This means that the two states are mutually exclusive, and we can infer the negation of one state based on the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
