In other words, if a twonk is plinked, it cannot be varnished at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if a twonk is varnished, it must not have been plinked. This is because varnishing and plinking are exclusive events, and it is not possible for a twonk to be both varnished and plinked at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
