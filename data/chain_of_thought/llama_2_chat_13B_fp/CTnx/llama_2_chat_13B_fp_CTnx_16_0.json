This implies that the sneg cannot be both crampled and sproted the frink at the same time.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite of the given statement, which is 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. This statement is the negation of the original statement, meaning that if the sneg sproted the frink, then it cannot be crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink', we can infer that if the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
