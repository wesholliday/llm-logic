This is because the word \"shanked\" is used to describe a specific type of hit that is not likely to produce a tinkling sound.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\", we need to reverse the logic of the original statement. This means that if the whiffle did make a tinkling sound, then it was not shanked, because shanked hits do not produce tinkling sounds.\n\nAnswer: yes",
