This means that if the zinger was in a state of being fraggled, then it was not in a state of being smoogled.\n\nNow, we need to reverse the logic to infer the new statement. If the zinger was not smoogled, then it must be in a state of being fraggled. Therefore, if the zinger was smoogled, then it was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
