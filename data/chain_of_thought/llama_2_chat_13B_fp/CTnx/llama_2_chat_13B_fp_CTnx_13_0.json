This means that the two states of being slogged and tragged are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot coexist.\n\nNow, if we try to infer the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\", we can see that it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This is because if the glip was tragged, it cannot be slogged, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
