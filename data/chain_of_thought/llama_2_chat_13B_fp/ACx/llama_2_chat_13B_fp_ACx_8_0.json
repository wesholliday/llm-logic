            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" and \"The sprocket was daggled.\" We want to know if we can infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from these two statements.\n\nTo determine this, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the second statement \"The sprocket was daggled\" is a premise, and the first statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the two.\n\nTherefore, if the sprocket was daggled, it must have been cranked at some point in the past, as the conditional statement implies that cranking the sprocket leads to daggling it.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
