In other words, plinking the twonk is a sufficient condition to ensure that it is varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'The twonk was varnished':\n\nThis statement simply states that the twonk is varnished, without providing any information about how it became varnished. However, based on the first statement, we know that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. Therefore, we can infer that the twonk was plinked.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
