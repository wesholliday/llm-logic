The word \"then\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between being plooked and being nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n\"The shank was nugged\"\n\nThis statement is saying that the shank was in a state of being nugged.\n\nSo, if we combine the two statements, we can infer that if the shank was nugged, then it must have been plooked. This is because the first statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between being plooked and being nugged.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
