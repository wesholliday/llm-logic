However, the second statement 'The fribble crinked' does not necessarily imply that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer 'The fribble was snurgled'. The relationship between the two statements is not sufficient to establish this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
