In other words, the possibility of the griffin being in the forest is not ruled out.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest. This inference is based on the fact that the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" does not provide any information about the griffin's presence or absence in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
