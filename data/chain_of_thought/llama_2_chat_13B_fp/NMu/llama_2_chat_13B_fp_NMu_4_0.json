This means that the possibility of the alien visiting Mars is not guaranteed or certain.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars, as there is no evidence or reason to suggest that they did. In other words, the absence of evidence or necessity for the alien to have visited Mars implies that it is possible that they did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
