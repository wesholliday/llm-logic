It simply means that the sunglasses could be anywhere else, and it is not a given that they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag. Instead, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, as there is no evidence to suggest that they are.\n\nAnswer: no",
