This means that the jacket could potentially be in any other location or position, and it does not have to be specifically draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair, as there is no evidence or information to suggest that it is required to be in that location.\n\nAnswer: yes",
