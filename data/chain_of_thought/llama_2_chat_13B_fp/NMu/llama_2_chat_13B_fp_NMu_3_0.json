In other words, it is possible that the book was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book might not have been written by James. This inference is based on the fact that the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" implies that there is no necessity or certainty that the book was written by James, which means that it is possible that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
