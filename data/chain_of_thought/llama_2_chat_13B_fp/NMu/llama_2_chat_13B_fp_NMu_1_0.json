In other words, it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding, we need to consider the possibility that she was not present. This possibility is suggested by the phrase \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
