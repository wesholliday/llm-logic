It does not necessarily mean that the toy is not in the toy box, but rather that it is not necessary for it to be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the toy must be in the toy box based on this statement alone. However, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box, as there is no guarantee that it is present in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no",
