It does not mean that the notebook cannot be in the drawer, but rather that it is not mandatory or obligatory for it to be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the notebook must be in the drawer. In fact, we can infer the opposite, that the notebook might not be in the drawer. This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" implies that there is no guarantee or certainty that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
