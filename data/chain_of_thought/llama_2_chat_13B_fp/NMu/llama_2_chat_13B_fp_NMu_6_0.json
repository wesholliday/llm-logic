It does not mean that Sue definitely did not choose pizza, but rather that there is no requirement or guarantee that she did.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue must have chosen pizza. Instead, we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza, since there is no logical necessity for her to have done so.\n\nAnswer: no",
