This means that if the shirt had the property of being made of cotton, then the pants had the property of being made of denim.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. To infer this, we need to consider the relationship between the properties of the shirt and the pants.\n\nIf the shirt was not cotton, then it must have some other property. Let's say it was made of polyester. In this case, we know that the pants were not made of denim, because the premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Therefore, if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
