If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob will choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Sue does not choose pizza. If Sue does not choose pizza, then it is possible that Bob may still choose pasta. This is because the relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice is direct, but it is not a guarantee.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
