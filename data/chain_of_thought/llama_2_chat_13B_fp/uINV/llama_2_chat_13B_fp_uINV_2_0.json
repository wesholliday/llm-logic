            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic logical reasoning puzzle. The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" implies that if the griffin was present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest. However, the question asks if we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements. If the griffin was not in the forest, then it is not possible for the unicorn to be in the forest, because the first statement implies that the unicorn's presence is contingent upon the griffin's presence. In other words, if the griffin is not present, then the unicorn cannot be present.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
