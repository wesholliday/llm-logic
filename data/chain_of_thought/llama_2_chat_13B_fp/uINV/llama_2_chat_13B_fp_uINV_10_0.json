This statement is based on the assumption that the dog and cat are not in the same location.\n\nNow, if we consider the negation of the original statement, \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside,\" we can see that this statement is logically equivalent to \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was inside.\"\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the dog was not inside, we can infer that the cat was inside, but we cannot infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
