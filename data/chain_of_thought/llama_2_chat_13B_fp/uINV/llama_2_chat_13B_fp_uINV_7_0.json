To determine this, we need to consider the possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nIf Alex did not finish the race, then we know that Chris did not finish the race, because if Alex did not finish, then Chris did not finish by the transitive property of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
