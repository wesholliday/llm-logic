This implies that there is a direct relationship between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's mode of transportation. If Sam did not take a plane, it does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train.\n\nFor example, if Sam drove to their destination, it is possible that Erin still took the train. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
