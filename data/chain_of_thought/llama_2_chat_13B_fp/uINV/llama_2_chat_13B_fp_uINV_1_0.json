This statement establishes a direct relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's attendance.\n\nTo infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, we need to consider the logical implications of the statement. If Mary did not attend the wedding, then it is possible that Sue did not attend the wedding as well. However, this inference is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons why Sue was not at the wedding, such as a scheduling conflict or a personal decision not to attend.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. The relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's attendance is not a necessary one, and there could be other factors that influence Sue's attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
