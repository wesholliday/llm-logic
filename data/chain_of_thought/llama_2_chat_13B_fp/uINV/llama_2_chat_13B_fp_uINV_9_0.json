            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This implies that there is a direct relationship between Lisa's purchase and Mark's purchase. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFor example, suppose Lisa decided not to buy the red shirt, but Mark still wanted to buy the blue shirt. In this case, Mark would have bought the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
