            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic logical reasoning puzzle. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. In other words, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. To answer this, we need to consider the possibility that the car might not have been red. If the car was not red, then the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" would not be true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the truck would not be blue. The statement only says that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, but it does not say that if the car is not red, then the truck must not be blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
