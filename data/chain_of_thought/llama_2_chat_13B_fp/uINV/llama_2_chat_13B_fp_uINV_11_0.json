It suggests that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins will be blueberry.\n\nTo infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry, we need to consider the possibility that there may be other types of cakes and muffins that are not related to the chocolate cake and blueberry muffins.\n\nFor example, if the cake was vanilla, then the muffins may be strawberry or raspberry, but not necessarily blueberry. Similarly, if the cake was red velvet, then the muffins may be cream cheese or carrot, but not necessarily blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry, as there may be other types of cakes and muffins that are not related to the chocolate cake and blueberry muffins.\n\nAnswer: no",
