            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference, and the answer is yes, we can make this inference. Here's why:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. In other words, if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, if we assume that the apple was not red, we can logically infer that the banana was not yellow. This is because the relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana is a direct one, and if the apple is not red, then the banana cannot be yellow.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
