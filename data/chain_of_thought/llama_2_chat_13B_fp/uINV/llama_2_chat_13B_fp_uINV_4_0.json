The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter based on these two statements.\n\nLet's assume that the alien visited Mars. In this case, the second statement tells us that the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, if the alien visited Mars, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's assume that the alien did not visit Mars. In this case, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter. There could be other reasons why the robot did not visit Jupiter, such as a malfunction or a change in plans. Therefore, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter based solely on the fact that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
