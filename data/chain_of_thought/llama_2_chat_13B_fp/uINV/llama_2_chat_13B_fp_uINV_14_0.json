The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" implies that if the bear was present in the cave, then the wolf must also be present in the den. However, the reverse inference is not necessarily true. Just because the bear is not in the cave, it does not mean that the wolf is not in the den.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
