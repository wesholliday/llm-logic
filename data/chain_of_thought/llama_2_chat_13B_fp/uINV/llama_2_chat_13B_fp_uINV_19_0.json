This implies that there is a direct relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. In other words, if Tom watches football, then Jen must be watching basketball.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This is a conditional statement, and we need to evaluate whether the condition is true or false.\n\nLet's assume that Tom did not watch football. This means that the premise \"Tom watched football\" is false. Therefore, we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball, because the premise \"Jen watched basketball\" is dependent on the premise \"Tom watched football\".\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
