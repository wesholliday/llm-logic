This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, we are asked to infer whether if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo make this inference, we need to consider the possibility that Joe did not go to the park. If Joe did not go to the park, then the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is not true. This means that Lucy may or may not have gone to the zoo, regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. The relationship between Joe's actions and Lucy's actions is not sufficient to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
