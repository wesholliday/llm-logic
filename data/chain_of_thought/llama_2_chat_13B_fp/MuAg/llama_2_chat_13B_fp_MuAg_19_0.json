This means that the application was not submitted in person or through the mail, but rather through a digital means.\n\nThe statement \"It must have included references\" implies that the application must have included information about the applicant's past experiences or qualifications, which are typically provided by references. This suggests that the application was not incomplete and that the applicant provided all the necessary information to support their application.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the application was completed online and included all the necessary information, including references.\n\nAnswer: yes",
