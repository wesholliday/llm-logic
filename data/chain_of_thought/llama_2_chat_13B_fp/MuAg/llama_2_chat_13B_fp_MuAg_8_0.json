The restaurant must have served Italian cuisine.\n\nWe want to infer a new statement based on these two given statements. To do this, we need to determine if the two statements are logically consistent with each other. In other words, we need to check if the two statements can both be true at the same time.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays.\n\nThis statement implies that the restaurant was not open on Mondays. It does not say anything about the type of cuisine served.\n\nStatement 2: The restaurant must have served Italian cuisine.\n\nThis statement implies that the restaurant served Italian food. It does not say anything about the days the restaurant was open.\n\nNow, let's try to infer a new statement based on these two given statements. We know that the restaurant was not open on Mondays, and we know that the restaurant served Italian cuisine. Can we infer that the restaurant served Italian cuisine on Mondays?\n\nTo do this, we need to determine if the two statements are logically consistent with each other. In other words, we need to check if the two statements can both be true at the same time.\n\nIf the restaurant was not open on Mondays, then it cannot have served Italian cuisine on Mondays. Therefore, the two statements are not logically consistent with each other.\n\nAnswer: No",
