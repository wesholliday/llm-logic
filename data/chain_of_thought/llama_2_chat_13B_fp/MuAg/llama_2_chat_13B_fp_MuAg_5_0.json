However, the phrase \"it must have been\" is a bit ambiguous, as it could imply that the delivery and signature are not confirmed, but rather assumed or expected.\n\nTo infer \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" we need to clarify the meaning of \"it must have been.\" One possible interpretation is that \"it must have been\" means \"it was,\" which would imply that the delivery and signature are confirmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the package was delivered today and signed for.\n\nAnswer: yes",
