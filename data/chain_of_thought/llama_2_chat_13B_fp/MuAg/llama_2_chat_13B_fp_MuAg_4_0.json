The phrase \"and it must be\" indicates that both the time and location are mandatory.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting must be at 2 PM and in the conference room,\" we can combine the two statements and eliminate the repetition of \"must be.\" This inference is logical because the time and location are both essential components of the meeting.\n\nAnswer: yes",
