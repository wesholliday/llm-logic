However, it does not explicitly state that the document must have been signed and notarized simultaneously.\n\nTo infer that the document must have been signed and notarized, we need to consider the meaning of each individual requirement.\n\n\"Signed\" implies that the document has been executed by the person or entity indicated as the signatory, and that they have acknowledged their agreement to the contents of the document.\n\n\"Notarized\" implies that the signature has been verified by a notary public, who has confirmed that the signatory is who they claim to be and that they have willingly signed the document.\n\nGiven these definitions, it is reasonable to infer that the document must have been signed and notarized, as both requirements are necessary to ensure the authenticity and validity of the document.\n\nAnswer: yes",
