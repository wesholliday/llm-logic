This means that the medicine should not be taken without food.\n\nThe second statement 'It must have been taken twice daily' implies that the medicine should be taken twice a day. This means that the medicine should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening.\n\nNow, let's think about the combination of these two statements. If the medicine must be taken with food and twice daily, then it means that the medicine should be taken with food twice a day. This is equivalent to saying that the medicine must have been taken with food and been taken twice daily.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
