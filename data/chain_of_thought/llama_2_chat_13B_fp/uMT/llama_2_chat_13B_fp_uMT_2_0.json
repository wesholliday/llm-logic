The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on these statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThis statement implies that if the griffin was present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest.\n\nStatement 2: The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThis statement tells us that the unicorn was not present in the forest.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these statements. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest, according to statement 1. However, we know that the unicorn was not in the forest, according to statement 2. This means that the griffin cannot be in the forest, because if it was, the unicorn would be there too.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
