Chris did not finish the race.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Alex did not finish the race based on these statements.\n\nLet's assume that Alex did finish the race. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (based on statement 1). However, we are also told that Chris did not finish the race. This means that Chris did not finish the race, even though Alex did.\n\nThis leads to a logical contradiction, as we have established that both Alex and Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
