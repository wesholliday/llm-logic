            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Tom did not watch football based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThis statement implies that there is a causal relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. In other words, if Tom watches football, then Jen will watch basketball.\n\nStatement 2: Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nThis statement tells us that Jen did not watch basketball, which means that the causal relationship established in statement 1 did not occur.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since Jen did not watch basketball, it means that the condition for the causal relationship in statement 1 did not occur. In other words, Tom did not watch football, because if he did, Jen would have watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
