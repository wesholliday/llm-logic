Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these statements.\n\nLet's assume that Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, according to statement 1. However, we are also told that Sue was not at the wedding, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's assume that Mary was not at the wedding. In this case, statement 1 is false, since Mary was not at the wedding and Sue was not at the wedding either. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based on statement 1.\n\nIn either case, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
