The banana was not yellow.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the apple was not red. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they are consistent.\n\nLet's assume that the apple was red. If the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow, according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that the banana was not yellow. This means that the apple cannot be red, because if it was, the banana would be yellow, and it is not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
