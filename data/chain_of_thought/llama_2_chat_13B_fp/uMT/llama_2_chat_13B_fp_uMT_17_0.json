Kate did not eat salad.\n\nWe want to infer whether Ben did not eat pasta based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nThis statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. However, we are also given that Kate did not eat salad. This means that the premise of the statement (Ben eating pasta) is false, as Kate did not eat salad.\n\nStatement 2: Kate did not eat salad.\n\nThis statement is independent of the first statement. It simply tells us that Kate did not eat salad, regardless of what Ben did.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. (False)\nKate did not eat salad.\n\nWe can infer that Ben did not eat pasta, as the first statement is false and the second statement does not provide any information about Ben's eating habits.\n\nAnswer: no",
