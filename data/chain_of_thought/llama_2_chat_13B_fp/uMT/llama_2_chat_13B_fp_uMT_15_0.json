Erin did not take a train.\n\nWe can start by examining the first statement. If Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train, according to the first statement. However, we are also given that Erin did not take a train, which means that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane, because if Sam had taken a plane, Erin would have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
