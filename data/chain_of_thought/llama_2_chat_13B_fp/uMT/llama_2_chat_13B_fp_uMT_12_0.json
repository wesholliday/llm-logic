Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park based on these statements.\n\nLet's assume that Joe did go to the park. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, according to statement 1. However, we are told that Lucy did not go to the zoo, so this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, as the only possible outcome of Joe going to the park would be Lucy going to the zoo, which did not happen.\n\nAnswer: no",
