The cat was not outside.\n\nWe can start by assuming that the dog was inside, and see where that takes us. If the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, according to statement 1. However, we are also told that the cat was not outside, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
