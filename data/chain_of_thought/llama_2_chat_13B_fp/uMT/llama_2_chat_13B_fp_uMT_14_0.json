The wolf was not in the den.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave based on these statements.\n\nLet's assume that the bear was in the cave. If the bear was in the cave, then according to statement 1, the wolf would be in the den. However, statement 2 tells us that the wolf was not in the den. This means that the wolf cannot be in the den, which implies that the bear cannot be in the cave either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
