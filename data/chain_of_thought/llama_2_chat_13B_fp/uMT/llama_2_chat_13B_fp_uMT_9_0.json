            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nLet's assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt. If she did, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, even though Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite assumption: Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In this case, Mark would not have bought the blue shirt, since Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is consistent with statement 2, which tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is true, regardless of whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. This means that we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
