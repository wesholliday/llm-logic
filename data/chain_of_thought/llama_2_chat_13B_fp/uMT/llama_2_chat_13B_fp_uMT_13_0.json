If the car was red, then the truck would be blue, according to the first statement. This means that if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue, but we are also given that the truck was not blue. This creates a contradiction, as we have two statements that cannot both be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
