Amy did not play tennis.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on these statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThis statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, we are also given that Amy did not play tennis, which means that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nStatement 2: Amy did not play tennis.\n\nThis statement is independent of the first statement, and it simply tells us that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but Amy did not play tennis. This means that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
