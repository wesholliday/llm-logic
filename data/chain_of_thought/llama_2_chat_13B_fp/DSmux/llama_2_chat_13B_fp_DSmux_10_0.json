It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled: This statement implies that there are only two possible states for the wug: sproinged or garpled.\n2. It's not the case that the wug must be garpled: This statement rules out the possibility that the wug must be garpled, which means that the wug is either sproinged or has no specific state (i.e., it is neither sproinged nor garpled).\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these two statements. If the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged, since there are only two possible states for the wug, and one of them is sproinged. Therefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
