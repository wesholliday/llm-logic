It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smonk is vreebled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged:\n\nThis statement implies that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged. It does not specify which one is true, only that one of them is true.\n\n2. It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged:\n\nThis statement tells us that the smonk cannot be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together and see if we can infer anything about the smonk:\n\nSince the smonk cannot be plagged, and it must be either vreebled or plagged, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
