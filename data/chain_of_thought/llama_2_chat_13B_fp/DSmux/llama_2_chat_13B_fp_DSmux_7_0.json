It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the whiffle is shanked based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\n\nThis statement implies that there are only two possibilities: either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. There is no third possibility.\n\n2. It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nThis statement tells us that the whiffle cannot be tinked. If the whiffle cannot be tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. If the whiffle cannot be tinked, then it must be shanked. Since we know that the whiffle cannot be tinked (based on statement 2), we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
