(This combination is not possible, as the first statement tells us that the sprocket cannot be daggled.)\n\nCombination 2: The sprocket is cranked but not daggled. (This combination is possible, as the first statement implies that the sprocket can be cranked but not daggled.)\n\nCombination 3: The sprocket is not cranked and not daggled. (This combination is also possible, as the first statement tells us that the sprocket can be neither cranked nor daggled.)\n\nBased on the information we have, we cannot infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the given statements. The statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
