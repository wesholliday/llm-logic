There is no middle ground.\n2. \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" - This statement tells us that the flugel cannot be zargled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The flugel is blimmed and it must be zargled. (This combination is not possible since we know the flugel cannot be zargled.)\n\nCombination 2: The flugel is not blimmed and it must not be zargled. (This combination is true since we know the flugel cannot be zargled.)\n\nCombination 3: The flugel is blimmed but it does not need to be zargled. (This combination is possible since we know the flugel can be blimmed without being zargled.)\n\nBased on the above combinations, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
