If the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This statement tells us that the splat cannot be quanked. If the splat cannot be quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
