We need to determine if we can infer \"The twonk is varnished\" from these statements.\n\nLet's analyze the first statement: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\". This statement implies that the twonk is either varnished or it must be plinked. There is no middle ground. If the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\". This statement tells us that the twonk cannot be plinked. If the twonk cannot be plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nPutting both statements together, we can infer that the twonk is varnished. The first statement implies that the twonk is either varnished or plinked, and the second statement tells us that it cannot be plinked, so it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
