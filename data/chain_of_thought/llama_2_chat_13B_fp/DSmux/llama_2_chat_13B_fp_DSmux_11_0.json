It does not imply that the flug is both blummed and zimmed.\n2. \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" - This statement implies that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of the two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The flug is blummed and not zimmed.\nCombination 2: The flug is not blummed and not zimmed.\n\nIn Combination 1, the flug is both blummed and not zimmed, which is a logical contradiction. Therefore, Combination 1 is impossible.\n\nIn Combination 2, the flug is not blummed and not zimmed, which means that the flug is neither blummed nor zimmed.\n\nGiven that the flug is neither blummed nor zimmed, we can infer that the flug is not blummed.\n\nAnswer: No",
