There is no middle ground.\n2. \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" - This statement tells us that the fleeg cannot be surned.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The fleeg is bluttered and it must be surned. (This combination is not possible since we know the fleeg cannot be surned.)\n\nCombination 2: The fleeg is not bluttered and it must be surned. (This combination is also not possible since we know the fleeg cannot be surned.)\n\nCombination 3: The fleeg is bluttered and it does not must be surned. (This combination is possible, and it means the fleeg is bluttered.)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
