There is no middle ground.\n2. \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" - This statement tells us that the glip cannot be tragged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The glip is slogged and it must be tragged.\nCombination 2: The glip is not slogged and it must not be tragged.\n\nIn Combination 1, the glip is both slogged and tragged, which is a logical contradiction. Therefore, Combination 1 is impossible.\n\nIn Combination 2, the glip is not slogged and it must not be tragged. This means that the glip is not tragged, but it could still be slogged.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that the glip is slogged. The statements do not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
