There is no middle ground. If the grommet is not sploffed, then it must be plopped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This statement tells us that the grommet cannot be plopped. If the grommet cannot be plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\nPutting both statements together, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed. The first statement tells us that the grommet is either sploffed or plopped, and the second statement tells us that it cannot be plopped, so it must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
