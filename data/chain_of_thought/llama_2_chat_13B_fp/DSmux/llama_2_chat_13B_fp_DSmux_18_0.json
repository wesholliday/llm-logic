It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the shank is plooked based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nThis statement means that the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged. There is no middle ground.\n\n2. It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nThis statement means that the shank cannot be nugged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The shank is plooked and it must be nugged. (This combination is not possible since we know the shank cannot be nugged.)\n\nCombination 2: The shank is not plooked and it must be nugged. (This combination is also not possible since we know the shank cannot be nugged.)\n\nCombination 3: The shank is plooked and it does not must be nugged. (This combination is possible, and it means that the shank is plooked but not necessarily nugged.)\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
