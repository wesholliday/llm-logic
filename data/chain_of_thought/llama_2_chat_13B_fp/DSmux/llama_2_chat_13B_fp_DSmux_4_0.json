To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's start by evaluating the first statement:\n\n1. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\"\n\nThis statement is saying that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked. If the fribble is snurgled, then it must be crinked. So, if the fribble is snurgled, it must be crinked.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second statement:\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\"\n\nThis statement is saying that the fribble does not have to be crinked. If the fribble does not have to be crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements. If the fribble is snurgled, then it must be crinked (based on the first statement). But, we are also told that the fribble does not have to be crinked (based on the second statement). This creates a logical contradiction, as we cannot have both statements be true at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
