If the exam was difficult, then it is likely that the questions were challenging and required a lot of effort to answer. On the other hand, if the exam was easy, then the questions were probably straightforward and didn't require much thought.\n\nNow, if we infer \"The exam must have been easy,\" we are making the assumption that the exam was on the easier side of the spectrum. This means that the questions were not challenging, and the test-taker was able to answer them with relative ease.\n\nAnswer: no",
