In order to infer that the flight must have been on time, we would need additional information or context.\n\nFor example, if we know that the flight was scheduled to depart at a specific time and the statement is made after the scheduled departure time, then we could infer that the flight must have been on time. However, without this additional information, we cannot infer that the flight must have been on time based solely on the statement \"The flight must have been delayed or on time.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
