The phrase \"or\" indicates that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning that the medicine cannot be taken with food and on an empty stomach at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the medicine must have been taken on an empty stomach, as the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
