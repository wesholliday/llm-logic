However, it does not explicitly state that the movie was subtitled.\n\nTo infer that the movie must have been subtitled, we need to consider the possibility that the movie was in English. If the movie was in English, then it would not need subtitles. Therefore, if the movie was in English, we can infer that it was not subtitled.\n\nOn the other hand, if the movie was not in English, then it must have been subtitled. This is because the statement \"The movie must have been in English or subtitled\" implies that the movie was either in English or had subtitles.\n\nAnswer: no",
