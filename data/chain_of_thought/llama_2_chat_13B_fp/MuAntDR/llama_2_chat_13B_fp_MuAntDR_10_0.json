However, we can infer that the document must have been notarized because the phrase \"or notarized\" suggests that there are only two possible options for the document's authenticity: it must be signed or it must be notarized.\n\nSince the document has been signed, the only remaining option is that it must also be notarized. Therefore, we can infer that the document must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
