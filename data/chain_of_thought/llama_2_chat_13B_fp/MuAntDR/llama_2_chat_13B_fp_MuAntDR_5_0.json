To infer that the package was delivered the day before, we need to consider the possibility that the delivery could have been made on the previous day.\n\nIf we assume that the delivery was made on the previous day, then the statement \"The package must have been delivered the day before\" would be true. Therefore, we can infer that the package was delivered the day before based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
