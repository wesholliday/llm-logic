            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" implies that all the tickets for the concert have been sold, which means that there are no more tickets available for purchase. This, in turn, suggests that the concert must have been postponed, as there would be no reason to sell tickets if the concert were not happening.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The concert must have been postponed\" based on the fact that it must have been sold out.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
