However, we can infer that the password must have been longer than eight characters based on the wording of the statement.\n\nThe phrase \"or longer\" suggests that the minimum length of the password is eight characters, but it does not set a maximum length. Therefore, we can infer that the password must have been longer than eight characters because there is no upper limit on the length specified in the statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
