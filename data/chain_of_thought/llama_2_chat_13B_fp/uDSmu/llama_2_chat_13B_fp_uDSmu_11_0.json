We also know that it's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. This means that the newspaper cannot be sitting on the porch, as that would contradict the fact that it's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. Therefore, the only possible location for the newspaper is the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
