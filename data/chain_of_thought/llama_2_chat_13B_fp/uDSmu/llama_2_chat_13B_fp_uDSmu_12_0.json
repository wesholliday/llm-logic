Therefore, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nHowever, the statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" tells us that the jacket is not required to be in the closet. This means that the jacket can be in either location, the chair or the closet, but it cannot be in both places at once.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: no",
