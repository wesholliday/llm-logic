This means that one of the two statements \"the book is on the shelf\" or \"the book is resting on the table\" must be true.\n\nHowever, we are also given that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the statement \"the book is resting on the table\" cannot be true. Therefore, the only possible truth is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
