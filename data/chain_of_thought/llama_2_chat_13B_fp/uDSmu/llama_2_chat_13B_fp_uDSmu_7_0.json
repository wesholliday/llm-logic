This means that the umbrella cannot be both in the car and tucked away in the closet at the same time.\n\nIf the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet, then it cannot be in the car. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is not in the closet, and hence it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
