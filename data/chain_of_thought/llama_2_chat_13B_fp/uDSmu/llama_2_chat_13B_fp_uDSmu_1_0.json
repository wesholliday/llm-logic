This means that one of the two statements \"Fido is inside\" or \"Fido must be in the garden\" must be true.\n\nWe also know that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that the statement \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside, because the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
