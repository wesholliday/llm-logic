This means that the milk cannot be in both places at once.\n\nIf the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then it cannot be on the counter. Therefore, if the milk is not in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nHowever, we are also told that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the milk could be on the counter or it could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nSo, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk is on the counter based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
