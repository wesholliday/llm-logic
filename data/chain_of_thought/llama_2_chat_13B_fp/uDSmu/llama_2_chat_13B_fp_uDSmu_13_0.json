This means that the toy cannot be in both places at the same time.\n\nIf the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box. This is because the only two possible locations for the toy are the toy box and the bookshelf, and we have already ruled out the bookshelf as a possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
