For example, if we know that the watch is not designed to charge on a dresser, or if we have observed the watch not charging on the dresser despite being placed there, then we could infer that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the watch must not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
