If the griffin might not have been in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This is because if the griffin might not have been in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest, and therefore it is not necessary that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
