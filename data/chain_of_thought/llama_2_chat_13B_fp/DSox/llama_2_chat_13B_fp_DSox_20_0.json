The second statement 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned' states that the fleeg has either the property of being bluttered or the property of being surned.\n\nSince the fleeg does not have the property of being surned, it must have the property of being bluttered, as the only other option is that the fleeg has neither property. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
