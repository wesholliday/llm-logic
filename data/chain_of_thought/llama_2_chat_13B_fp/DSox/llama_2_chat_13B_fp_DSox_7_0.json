It does not provide any information about the whiffle being shanked.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked\"\n\nThis statement tells us that the whiffle is either shanked or tinked. It does not provide any information about the whiffle not being shanked.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked, because the only two options are shanked or tinked. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
