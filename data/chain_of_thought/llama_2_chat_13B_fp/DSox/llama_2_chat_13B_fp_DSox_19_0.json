It does not provide any information about the smonk being vreebled.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\"\n\nThis statement tells us that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged. It does not provide any information about the smonk being not plagged.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical relationship between these two statements. If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled (based on statement 2). However, we already know that the smonk is not plagged (based on statement 1). Therefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
