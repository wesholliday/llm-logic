The second statement 'Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped' states that the smip is either in the shripped state or the lupped state.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can deduce that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be in the shripped state, since there is no other possible state for the smip according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
