This means that the zinger is in a state where it is not smoogled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled. This means that the zinger is either in a state where it is fraggled or in a state where it is smoogled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled (based on Statement 2). But we know that the zinger is not smoogled (based on Statement 1), so this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
