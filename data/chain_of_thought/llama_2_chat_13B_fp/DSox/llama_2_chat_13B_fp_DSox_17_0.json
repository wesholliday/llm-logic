It does not provide any information about the flob being skizzled.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated\"\n\nThis statement tells us that the flob is either skizzled or motivated. If the flob is not motivated (as stated in statement 1), then it must be skizzled.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that the flob is skizzled. Here's why:\n\nIf the flob is not motivated (as stated in statement 1), then it must be skizzled (as stated in statement 2). Therefore, we can conclude that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
