This means that the flugel is in a different state, which we can call 'blimmed' for the sake of this inference.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled' tells us that the flugel is either in a state of being blimmed or in a state of being zargled. Since we know that the flugel is not zargled, we can conclude that it must be in the other state, which is being blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
