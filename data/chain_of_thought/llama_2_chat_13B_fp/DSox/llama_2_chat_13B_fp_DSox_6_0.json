The second statement 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped' states that the grommet is either in the sploffed state or the plopped state.\n\nSince the grommet is not in the plopped state, it must be in the sploffed state, as the only other option is the plopped state. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
