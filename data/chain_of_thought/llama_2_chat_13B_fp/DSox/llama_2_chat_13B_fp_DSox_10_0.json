The second statement 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled' states that the wug is either in a state of being sproinged or it is in a state of being garpled.\n\nSince we know that the wug is not garpled, we can deduce that the wug must be in a state of being sproinged, as the only other option is that it is garpled, which we have already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
