This means that the flug is in a different state, which we can call 'blummed' for the sake of this argument.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed' tells us that the flug is either in a state of being blummed or in a state of being zimmed. Since we have already established that the flug is not zimmed, we can conclude that the flug is in a state of being blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
