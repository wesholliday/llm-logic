            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether it follows that 'The book was written by James' is true, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the given statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses. In this case, the cause is 'the book was written by James' and the effect is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe second statement 'The book is a mystery novel' is an independent statement that simply asserts a fact about the book.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these two statements. If the first statement is true, then we know that 'the book is a mystery novel' must also be true, since the effect of the cause (i.e., 'the book was written by James') is that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily follow that it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels, and there could be other books that are mystery novels but were not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true based solely on the fact that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
