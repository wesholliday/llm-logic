Since the second statement is \"The truck was metal,\" this means that the condition for the first statement to be true is satisfied, so we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nHowever, we are only given that the truck was metal, not that the doll was plastic. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
