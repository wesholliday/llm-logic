The mummy was awake (premise)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the vampire was awake. To determine this, we can use logical inference.\n\nFirst, we can substitute the second premise into the first premise to get:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\n\nNow, we have:\n\nThe mummy was awake\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\n\nWe can simplify this by combining the two statements:\n\nThe vampire was awake and the mummy was awake\n\nSo, we have shown that if the premises are true, it follows that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
