            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether it follows that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the given statements.\n\nThe first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The pants were denim\" is a simple statement that is independent of the first statement.\n\nSo, to determine the truth of the third statement \"The shirt was cotton\", we need to consider the logical implications of the first two statements.\n\nIf the first statement is true, then we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. But this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton. It only means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
