It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the splat was not morphed. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the splat's morphed status.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. However, we are also given that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked. This means that the first statement is false, since we know that the splat did not quank.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\n\nThis statement is saying that it's not true that the splat must have quanked. Since we know that the splat did not quank, this statement is also false.\n\nSo, we have two false statements. In logic, the law of non-contradiction states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
