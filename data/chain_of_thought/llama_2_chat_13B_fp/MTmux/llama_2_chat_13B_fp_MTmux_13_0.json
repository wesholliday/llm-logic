It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the glip was not slogged. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument formed by these two premises.\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\nPremise 1: If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nThis premise states that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged. This means that if the glip was in a state of being slogged, then it must have also been in a state of being tragged.\n\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n\nThis premise states that it is not the case that the glip must have been in a state of being tragged. This means that the glip was not in a state of being tragged.\n\nNow, let's put the two premises together and see if we can infer that the glip was not slogged:\n\nFrom Premise 1, if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged. But from Premise 2, it is not the case that the glip must have tragged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: no",
