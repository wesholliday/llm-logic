It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sneg was not crampled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the sneg's crampedness.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. However, we are also given that it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that the first statement is false, since we know that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that it's not true that the sneg must have sproted the frink. However, we just established that the first statement is false, which means that the second statement is also false.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can deduce that the sneg was not crampled. This is because we know that if the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink, but we also know that the sneg did not sprot the frink. Therefore, the only conclusion we can draw is that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
