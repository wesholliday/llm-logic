To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"\n\nThis statement is saying that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. In other words, if the clug had the quality of being fleeked, then it must have had the quality of being snugged as well.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\"\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not the case that the clug must have been snugged. In other words, the clug does not have the quality of being snugged.\n\nSo, if we combine these two statements, we can deduce that the clug does not have the quality of being fleeked, because if it did, it would have the quality of being snugged, but we have established that it does not have that quality.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
