To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's first assume that the fleeg was bluttered. If this were the case, then the first statement would be true, and the second statement would be false. However, we are also given that the second statement is true, which means that the fleeg must not have been surned.\n\nNow, let's assume that the fleeg was not bluttered. In this case, the first statement would be false, and the second statement would be true. This means that the fleeg must have been surned, which is a contradiction to our assumption that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
