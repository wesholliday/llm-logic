It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the fribble was not snurgled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. This means that if the fribble was in a state of snurgling, then it must have also been in a state of crinkling.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not the case that the fribble must have been in a state of crinkling. This means that the fribble may or may not have been in a state of crinkling, but it is not a necessary condition.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked, but we know that it is not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the fribble cannot have been snurgled, because if it was, it would have crinked, and we know that it did not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
