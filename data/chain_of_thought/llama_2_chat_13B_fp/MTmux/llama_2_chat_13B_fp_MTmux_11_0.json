It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flug was not blummed. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument formed by these two premises.\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nThis premise states that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. This means that if the flug was blummed, then it must have had the property of being zimmed.\n\n2. It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nThis premise states that it is not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that the flug does not have the property of being zimmed.\n\nNow, let's put these two premises together to form an argument:\n\nIf the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\nIt's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nCan we infer that the flug was not blummed?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. If the argument is valid, then we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nLet's evaluate the argument:\n\nThe first premise states that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. However, the second premise states that it is not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that the first premise is false, and therefore the argument is invalid.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flug was not blummed based on these two premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
