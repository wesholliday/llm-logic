It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smonk was not vreebled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the smonk's vreebledness.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, we are also given that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged (statement 2). This means that we can deduce that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nNow, let's examine the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nThis statement is saying that it's not true that the smonk must have plagged. However, we can infer from the first statement that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. Therefore, we can deduce that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
