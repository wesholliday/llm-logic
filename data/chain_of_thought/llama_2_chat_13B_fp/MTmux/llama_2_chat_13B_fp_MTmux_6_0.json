It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the grommet was not sploffed. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the grommet's state.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have performed the action of plopping the frink. However, we are also given that the grommet did not plop the frink, so this statement cannot be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, let's examine the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not the case that the grommet must have performed the action of plopping the frink. However, we have already established that the grommet did not plop the frink, so this statement is also true.\n\nBased on the two statements, we can deduce that the grommet was not sploffed. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
