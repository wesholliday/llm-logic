It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sprocket was not cranked. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the opposite of the second statement, which would be that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement. If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been in a state of being daggled. However, we are also given that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that the sprocket cannot be in a state of being daggled, even if it was cranked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the sprocket must have been daggled, then it cannot be the case that it was not cranked. This is because being daggled implies that the sprocket was in a state of being cranked. Therefore, if the sprocket must have been daggled, then it must have been cranked.\n\nHowever, we are also given that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that the sprocket cannot be in a state of being daggled, even if it was cranked. Therefore, we can deduce that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
