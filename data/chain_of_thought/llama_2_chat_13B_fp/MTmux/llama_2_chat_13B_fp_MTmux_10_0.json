It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the wug was not sproinged. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can draw a logical conclusion.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. In other words, if the wug was sproinged, then it is certain that it was garpled.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not the case that the wug must have been garpled. In other words, it is possible that the wug was not garpled, even if it was sproinged.\n\nSo, what can we infer from these two statements? Well, if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled, according to the first statement. But the second statement tells us that it is not the case that the wug must have been garpled. This means that we cannot infer that the wug was garpled, even if it was sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
