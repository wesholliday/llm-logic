It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the whiffle was not shanked. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the whiffle's state.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the whiffle was shanked (i.e., hit with a certain amount of force), then it must have made a sound (i.e., tinked). This implies that if the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not make a sound.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nThis statement is saying that it is not true that the whiffle must have tinked. This means that the whiffle may or may not have tinked, but it is not a necessary consequence of being shanked.\n\nSo, what can we infer from these two statements? Well, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked (according to the first statement). But we also know that it is not the case that the whiffle must have tinked (according to the second statement). This means that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
