It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flugel was not blimmed. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the flugel's state.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have undergone the process of zargling. However, we are also given that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This means that the flugel cannot have been zargled, as zargling is a necessary condition for blimming.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
