It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flob was not skizzled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the flob's skizzliness.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. However, this statement is not saying that the flob was skizzled. It's simply saying that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\n\nThis statement is saying that it's not the case that the flob must have moved. This statement is not saying anything about the flob's skizzliness. It's simply saying that the flob does not have to move.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled. We cannot deduce anything about the flob's skizzliness from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
