To infer the statement \"The bimboozle must be at snorkel quank and in the flump quazzle\" would require additional information or context.\n\nThe word \"and\" in the proposed inference suggests a logical conjunction between the two statements, implying that the bimboozle must be present at both snorkel quank and the flump quazzle simultaneously. However, there is no information in the original statement to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
