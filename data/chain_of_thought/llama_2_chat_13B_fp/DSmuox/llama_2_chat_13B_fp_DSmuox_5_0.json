Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the zinger is fraggled.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled. This means that there is a possibility that the zinger is fraggled, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled. This means that if the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled (Statement 2). But we know that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled (Statement 1). Therefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
