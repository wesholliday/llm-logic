It does not imply that the twonk is varnished or that it must be varnished.\n2. \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" - This statement tells us that the twonk is either varnished or it must be plinked. It does not imply that the twonk is not varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the twonk is not required to be plinked, and it must be either varnished or plinked. This means that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
