Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the grommet is sploffed. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the grommet is not plopped, since the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the grommet must be plopped. This means that the grommet is either sploffed or it must be plopped.\n\nSecond, we know that the grommet is either sploffed or it must be plopped, since the second statement tells us that this is the case.\n\nNow, we need to think about what these two statements together tell us. Since the grommet is not plopped and it is either sploffed or it must be plopped, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed. This is because the only other option is that it must be plopped, but we know that it is not plopped. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
