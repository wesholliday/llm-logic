Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the shank is plooked. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the shank cannot be nugged, which means it must be in one of the other two states: plooked or not plooked.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the shank is either plooked or must be nugged. This means that if the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged (Statement 2).\n\nBut we know that the shank cannot be nugged (Statement 1).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
