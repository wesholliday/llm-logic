To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the flugel is not necessarily zargled. This means that there is no guarantee that the flugel is zargled, but it also means that it is possible that the flugel is zargled.\n\nNext, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This means that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements. If the flugel is blimmed, then it is not zargled (by statement 1), and if it is not blimmed, then it must be zargled (by statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
