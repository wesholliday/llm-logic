It does not imply that the flug is blummed or that it must be blummed.\n2. \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" - This statement tells us that the flug is either blummed or it must be zimmed. It does not imply that the flug is not blummed.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the flug is not required to be zimmed, and it must be either blummed or zimmed. This means that the flug must be either blummed or zimmed. Since we know that the flug is not zimmed, we can infer that it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
