This means that the sneg is not in a state of being sproted.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted. This means that if the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nIf the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted (Statement 2). However, we know that the sneg is not required to be sproted (Statement 1). Therefore, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
