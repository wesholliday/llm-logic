Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smip is shripped.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the smip cannot be lupped. This means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. This means that if the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped.\n\nNow, we know that the smip cannot be lupped (from Statement 1), and it must be either shripped or lupped (from Statement 2). Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
