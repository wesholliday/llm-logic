In other words, it is possible for the wug to exist without being bimmed.\n2. \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" - This statement tells us that the wug must be either flooped or bimmed. There is no third option.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements together. If the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped (based on the second statement). However, we already know that the wug is not required to be bimmed (based on the first statement). Therefore, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
