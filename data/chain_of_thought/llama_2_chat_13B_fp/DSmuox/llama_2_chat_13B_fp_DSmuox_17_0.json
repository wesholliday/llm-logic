Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flob is skizzled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the flob must be movated. This statement implies that the flob is not necessarily movated, but it does not rule out the possibility that the flob is skizzled.\n2. Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. This statement implies that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The flob is movated and not skizzled. This combination is possible because we know that the flob is not necessarily movated, and it could be movated without being skizzled.\n\nCombination 2: The flob is skizzled and not movated. This combination is also possible because we know that the flob must be skizzled if it is not movated.\n\nCombination 3: The flob is neither movated nor skizzled. This combination is not possible because we know that the flob must be either movated or skizzled based on the second statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the combinations:\n\nCombination 1: The flob is movated and not skizzled. In this case, we cannot infer that the flob is skizzled because we know that the flob is not necessarily skizzled even if it is movated.\n\nCombination 2: The flob is skizzled and not movated. In this case, we can infer that the flob is skizzled because we know that the flob must be skizzled if it is not movated.\n\nCombination 3: The flob is neither movated nor skizzled. This combination is not possible, so we cannot infer anything about the flob's skizzliness.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flob is skizzled only if it is not movated.\n\nAnswer: no",
