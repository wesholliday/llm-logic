Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the wug is not necessarily garpled. This means that there is a possibility that the wug is not garpled, but it does not guarantee that it is sproinged.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. This means that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The wug is garpled.\nIn this case, statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nCombination 2: The wug is not garpled.\nIn this case, statement 1 is true, and statement 2 tells us that the wug must be sproinged. Therefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
