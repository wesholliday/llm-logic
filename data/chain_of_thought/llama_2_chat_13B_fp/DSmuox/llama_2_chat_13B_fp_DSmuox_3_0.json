In other words, there is no requirement that the splat must be quanked.\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" - This statement tells us that the splat is either morphed or it must be quanked. There is no middle ground; the splat is either one or the other.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements might be related. If the splat is not necessarily quanked, then it must be morphed, right? After all, if the splat is not quanked, then it must be something else, and that something else is morphed.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch! Just because the splat is not quanked doesn't necessarily mean it's morphed. Maybe there's another explanation for why the splat isn't quanked. Maybe it's just not that kind of splat.\n\nSo, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed. There might be other explanations for why the splat isn't quanked that don't involve morphing.\n\nAnswer: no",
