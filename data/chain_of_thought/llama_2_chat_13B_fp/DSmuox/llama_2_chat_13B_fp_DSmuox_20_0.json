It does not provide any information about the fleeg's current state (bluttered or not).\n2. \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" - This statement tells us that the fleeg is either bluttered or it must be surned. It does not provide any information about the fleeg's current state (bluttered or not).\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the fleeg is not required to be surned, and it is either bluttered or it must be surned. This means that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements together, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
