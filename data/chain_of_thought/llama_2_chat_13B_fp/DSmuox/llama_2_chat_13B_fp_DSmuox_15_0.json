Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the dreb is vroombed based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the dreb must be spened. This statement tells us that there is no requirement for the dreb to be spened. In other words, it is not necessary for the dreb to be spened.\n2. Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened. This statement tells us that the dreb is either vroombed or it must be spened. There is no third option.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements together. If the dreb is not required to be spened, then it must be vroombed. This is because there is no other option left - either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
