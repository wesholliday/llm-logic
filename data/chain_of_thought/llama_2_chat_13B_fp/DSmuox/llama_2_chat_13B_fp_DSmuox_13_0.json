It does not imply that the glip is slogged or that it must be slogged.\n2. \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged\" - This statement tells us that the glip is either slogged or it must be tragged. It does not imply that the glip is not slogged.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We know that the glip is not required to be tragged, and it must be either slogged or tragged. This means that the glip must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
