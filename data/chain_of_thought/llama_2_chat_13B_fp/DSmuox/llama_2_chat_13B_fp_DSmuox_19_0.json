Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smonk is vreebled. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the smonk is not necessarily plagged. This means that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged, but it does not provide any information about whether the smonk is vreebled.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged. However, since we know that the smonk is not necessarily plagged (from statement 1), we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
