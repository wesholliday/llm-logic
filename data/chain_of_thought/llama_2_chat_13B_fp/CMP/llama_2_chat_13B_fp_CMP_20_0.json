    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

If tea does not retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will likely retain the most morning drinkers. However, the question asks if it follows that if coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possibility that coffee may not retain the most morning drinkers. If coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers, then tea may retain the most morning drinkers, and soda may still be consumed much less in the mornings. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that if coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: No",
