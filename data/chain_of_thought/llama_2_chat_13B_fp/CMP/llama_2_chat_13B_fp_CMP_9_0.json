    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nBased on the information provided, we know that apples, bananas, and oranges are the top-selling fruits, and that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. The statement suggests that if bananas aren't the top seller, then oranges will be.\n\nWe can break down the statement into two parts:\n\n1. If bananas aren't the top seller, then oranges will be.\n2. Apples are likely to be the top seller.\n\nNow, let's consider the first part of the statement. If bananas aren't the top seller, it means that they are not in the top position. In that case, the top position would be vacant, and the next best seller would occupy that position. Since oranges are the next best seller after bananas, they would be the top seller if bananas aren't.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the statement. If apples are likely to be the top seller, it means that they have a high probability of being the top seller. In that case, it is less likely that oranges will be the top seller, as they are not as popular as apples and bananas.\n\nPutting both parts together, it follows that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, it is less likely that oranges will be the top seller, as the top position would be vacant, and oranges are not as popular as apples and bananas.\n\nAnswer: no",
