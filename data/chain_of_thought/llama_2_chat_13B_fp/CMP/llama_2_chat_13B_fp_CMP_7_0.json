    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, and wind power is lagging significantly behind. If solar power does not generate the most electricity, then wind power will. Additionally, tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, so solar power is unlikely to generate the most electricity.\n\nNow, the question is whether it follows that if tidal power does not generate the most electricity, wind power will. To answer this, we need to consider the possibility that tidal power may not generate the most electricity. If tidal power does not generate the most electricity, then solar power is likely to generate the most electricity, as it is the next most likely source of electricity. However, since wind power is lagging significantly behind, it is unlikely that wind power will generate the most electricity.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that if tidal power does not generate the most electricity, wind power will. The correct answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
