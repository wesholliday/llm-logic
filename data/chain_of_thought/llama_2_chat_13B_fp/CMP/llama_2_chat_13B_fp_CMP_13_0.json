    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US, with Tennessee expected to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and Missouri's growth being significantly lower. We are also given that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Georgia will.\n\nTo determine the likelihood that Missouri will add the most jobs if Tennessee doesn't, we need to consider the possibility that Georgia may not add the most jobs. If Georgia does not add the most jobs, then Missouri's growth will be significantly lower than Tennessee's and Georgia's. However, if Georgia does add the most jobs, then Missouri's growth will still be lower than Tennessee's and Georgia's, but not as low as if Georgia had not added the most jobs.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that Missouri will add the most jobs if Tennessee doesn't is dependent on the outcome of Georgia's job growth. If Georgia does not add the most jobs, then it is likely that Missouri will not add the most jobs either. However, if Georgia does add the most jobs, then it is less likely that Missouri will add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: no",
