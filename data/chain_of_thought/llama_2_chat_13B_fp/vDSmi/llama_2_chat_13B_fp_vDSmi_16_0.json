This premise is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true. The second premise states that the pen might not be on my desk. This premise is a negative statement, indicating that the pen might not be in one of the two possible locations mentioned in the first premise.\n\nNow, let's analyze how the conclusion follows from the premises. If the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag, since these are the only two possible locations mentioned in the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
