This premise is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it asserts the existence of one of two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nThe second premise states that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This premise is a negative statement, meaning that it asserts the non-existence of one possibility: the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\nThe conclusion states that the keys are in the drawer. This conclusion logically follows from the first premise, since if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (as stated in the second premise), then they must be in the drawer (by the first premise).\n\nAnswer: yes",
