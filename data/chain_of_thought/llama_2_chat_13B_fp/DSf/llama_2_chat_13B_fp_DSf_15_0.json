The shoes are lined up by the door: In this case, we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door, so the only remaining option is that they are in the closet.\n2. The shoes are not lined up by the door: This case is already given to us as true, so we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
