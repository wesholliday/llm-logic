The cookies are hidden in the pantry: In this case, we know that the cookies are not in the pantry, so they must be in the jar.\n2. The cookies are in the jar: This case is already established by the premise 'Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The cookies are in the jar' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
