The book is resting on the table: In this case, we know that the book is not resting on the table, so it must be on the shelf.\n2. The book is on the shelf: This case is already given, so we can conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The book is on the shelf' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
