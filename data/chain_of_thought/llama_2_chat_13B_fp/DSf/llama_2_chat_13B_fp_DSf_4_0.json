The cat is playing in the bedroom: In this case, the statement 'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom' is true, which means that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n2. The cat is napping on the couch: In this case, the statement 'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom' is true, which means that the cat is indeed napping on the couch.\n\nSince we know that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, we can conclude that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
