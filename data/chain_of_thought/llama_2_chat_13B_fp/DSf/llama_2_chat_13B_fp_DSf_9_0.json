The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing puzzle piece is in the box. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nLet's consider the first statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\" This statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece could be either on the floor or in the box. If it is on the floor, it would be blending in, but if it is in the box, it wouldn't be blending in.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\" This statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, which means it must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
