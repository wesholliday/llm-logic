The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can logically deduce that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. The notebook is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nIf this statement were true, we would know that the notebook is not in the drawer, because it is sitting on the nightstand. However, we are also given that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nIf this statement were true, we would know that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, because it is in the drawer. This statement is consistent with the fact that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, so it could be true.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
