The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing sock is in the laundry basket. To do this, we need to determine which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nIf the missing sock is under the bed, then it cannot be in the laundry basket. Therefore, if we know that the missing sock isn't under the bed, we can infer that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
