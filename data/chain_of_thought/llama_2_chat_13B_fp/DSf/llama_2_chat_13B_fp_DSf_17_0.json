The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the scarf is either draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack. This means that if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack. Therefore, we can conclude that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
