The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the toy is in the toy box based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the toy can either be sitting on the shelf or in the toy box. This means that if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the toy is not sitting on the shelf. This means that the toy cannot be sitting on the shelf, which implies that it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
