Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the remote control is on the coffee table. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, which means it must be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. Since we know it's not hiding under the couch, it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
