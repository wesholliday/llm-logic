Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the cookies cannot be in the pantry, so we can rule out that possibility.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the cookies must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. Since we have already ruled out the pantry, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
