Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the pen is in my bag. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the pen cannot be on my desk. This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk. Since we know that the pen cannot be on my desk (from Statement 1), we can conclude that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
