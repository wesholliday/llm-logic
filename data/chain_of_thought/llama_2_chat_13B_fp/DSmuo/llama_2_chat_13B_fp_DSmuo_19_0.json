Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the watch is charging on the dresser. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the watch is not on his wrist, so we can eliminate that possibility. This means that the watch must be either charging on the dresser or somewhere else.\n\nSecond, we are told that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
