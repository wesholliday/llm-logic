Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sunglasses are in her bag. Let's analyze the two statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head, which means they must be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the sunglasses can either be in her bag or perched on her head. Since we know they are not perched on her head (from Statement 1), the only possible location left is her bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
