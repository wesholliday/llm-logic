Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book is on the shelf. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the book cannot be resting on the table. This means that if the book is on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. Since we know that the book cannot be resting on the table (from Statement 1), the only possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. We know that the book cannot be resting on the table, and it must be either on the shelf or on the table. Since we have already established that the book cannot be on the table, the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
