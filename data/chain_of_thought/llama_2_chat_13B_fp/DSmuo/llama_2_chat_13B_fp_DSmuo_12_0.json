Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the jacket is draped over the chair. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, which means it must be either draped over the chair or somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. Since we know the jacket is not hanging in the closet (from Statement 1), we can conclude that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
