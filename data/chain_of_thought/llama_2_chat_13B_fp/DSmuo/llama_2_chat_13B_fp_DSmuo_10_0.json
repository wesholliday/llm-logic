Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing sock is in the laundry basket. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the missing sock cannot be under the bed. This means that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. Since we know that the missing sock is not under the bed (from Statement 1), it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
