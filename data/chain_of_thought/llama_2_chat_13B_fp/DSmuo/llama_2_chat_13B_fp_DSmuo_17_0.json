Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. To do this, we need to determine whether the scarf can be draped on the coat rack.\n\nIf the scarf can be draped on the coat rack, then it is not stuffed in my backpack, because the statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" would be false.\n\nOn the other hand, if the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack, because the statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" would be true.\n\nTherefore, we need to determine whether the scarf can be draped on the coat rack.\n\nAnswer: no",
