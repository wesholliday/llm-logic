Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. Let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand. This means that if the notebook is in the drawer, it cannot be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the notebook must be either in the drawer or sitting on the nightstand. This means that if the notebook is not in the drawer, it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, we know that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand (Statement 1), and it must be either in the drawer or sitting on the nightstand (Statement 2). Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
