To infer that the wozzle might be quorple on zazzle, we need to determine if the phrase \"quorple on zazzle\" is present in the sentence.\n\nThe sentence does contain the word \"quorple\", but it does not specifically say \"quorple on zazzle\". Therefore, we cannot infer that the wozzle might be quorple on zazzle based solely on this sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
