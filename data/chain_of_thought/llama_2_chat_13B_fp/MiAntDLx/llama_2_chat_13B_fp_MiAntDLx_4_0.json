However, it does not explicitly state that the gribble is definitely at quorple flimble.\n\nTo infer that the gribble might be at quorple flimble, we would need additional information or context that suggests the gribble is more likely to be at quorple flimble than at grooble. Without such information, we cannot infer that the gribble is definitely at quorple flimble.\n\nAnswer: no",
