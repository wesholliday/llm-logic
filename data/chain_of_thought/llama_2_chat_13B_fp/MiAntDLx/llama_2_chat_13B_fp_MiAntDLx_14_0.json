The word \"or\" indicates that one of these phrases must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nTo infer \"The fizzle might be glorp for a quimble\", we need to consider the possibility that \"for a quibble\" is not true. If \"for a quibble\" is not true, then the only remaining phrase is \"for a quimble\", which implies that \"The fizzle might be glorp for a quimble\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
