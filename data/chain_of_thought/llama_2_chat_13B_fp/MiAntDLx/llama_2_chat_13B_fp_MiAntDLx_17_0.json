However, it does not explicitly state that the flibbit is definitely snizzle.\n\nTo infer that the flibbit might be snizzle, we need to consider the possibility that the flibbit might be snorkel as well. If the flibbit is snorkel, then it cannot be snizzle, and therefore, we cannot infer that the flibbit might be snizzle based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
