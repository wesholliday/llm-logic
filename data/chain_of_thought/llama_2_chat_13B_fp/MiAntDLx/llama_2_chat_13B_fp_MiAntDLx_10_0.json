However, it does not explicitly state that the wozzle is definitely shimble.\n\nTo infer that the wozzle might be shimble, we would need additional information or context that suggests the wozzle is more likely to be shimble than flibbit. Without such information, we cannot make a definitive inference that the wozzle is shimble.\n\nAnswer: no",
