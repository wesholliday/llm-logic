In other words, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Ben ate pasta\" logically follows from the premises \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n2. Kate ate salad.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would eat salad.
