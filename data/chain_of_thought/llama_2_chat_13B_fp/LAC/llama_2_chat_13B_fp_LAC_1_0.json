            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given statements, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothetical situation is Mary being at the wedding, and the consequence is Sue being at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement is a simple statement of fact.\n\nTo logically infer that Mary was at the wedding, we need to determine if the given statements are sufficient to establish the truth of the conclusion. In other words, we need to determine if the statements are logically consistent and if they provide enough information to support the conclusion.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nWe can see that the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a simple statement of fact. Both statements are true, and they are logically consistent.\n\nNow, let's try to logically infer the conclusion:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (given)\nSue was at the wedding. (given)\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
