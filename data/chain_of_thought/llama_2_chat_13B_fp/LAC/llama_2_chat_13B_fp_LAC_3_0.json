The book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can logically infer that the book was written by James based on these two premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This premise states that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel. This premise states that the book is, in fact, a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two premises. If the book is a mystery novel, and James wrote the book, then we can infer that the book was written by James. However, we cannot infer that James wrote the book simply because it is a mystery novel. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the book was written by James based solely on the two premises given.\n\nAnswer: No",
