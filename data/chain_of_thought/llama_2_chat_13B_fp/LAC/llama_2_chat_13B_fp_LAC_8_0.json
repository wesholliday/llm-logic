            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can logically infer the vampire was awake based on these premises. To do this, we need to assess the validity of the argument formed by these premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The mummy was awake.\n\nConclusion: The vampire was awake.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument's validity. Validity refers to whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, does the conclusion have to be true as well?\n\nTo determine validity, we can use a technique called substitution. We can substitute the premises into the conclusion to see if it remains true.\n\nIf we substitute Premise 1 into the conclusion, we get:\n\n\"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, and the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThis statement is still true, so the conclusion is still valid.\n\nIf we substitute Premise 2 into the conclusion, we get:\n\n\"The mummy was awake, and the vampire was awake.\"\n\nThis statement is also true, so the conclusion is still valid.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid, and we can infer that the vampire was awake based on the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
