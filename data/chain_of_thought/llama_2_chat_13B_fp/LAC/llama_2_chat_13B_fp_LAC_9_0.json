            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is of the form \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" together with \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". This is a conditional statement, and we need to assess whether the condition is true.\n\nIf we assume that Mark bought the blue shirt, then we can infer that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, we are also given that Mark did buy the blue shirt, so we can conclude that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
