If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n2. Bob chose pasta\n\nWe can start by assuming that Bob chose pasta, and see if we can deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nIf Bob chose pasta, then the first statement implies that Sue did not choose pasta. This is because the \"if\" statement implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. In other words, if Bob chose pasta, then Sue cannot have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can deduce that Sue did not choose pasta. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. There could be other options that Sue chose instead of pasta or pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
