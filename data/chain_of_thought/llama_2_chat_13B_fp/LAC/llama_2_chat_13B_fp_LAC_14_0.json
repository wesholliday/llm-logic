If the antecedent is true, then the conclusion (the wolf was in the den) must also be true, based on the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the truth of the premises and the validity of the inference:\n\nPremise 1: 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' - This premise is true because it is a logical statement that describes a possible relationship between the bear and the wolf.\n\nPremise 2: 'The wolf was in the den' - This premise is true because it is a simple statement that the wolf was in the den.\n\nInference: 'The bear was in the cave' - This inference is valid because it logically follows from the truth of the premises. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, and we know that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we can logically infer that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
