            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can logically infer that the shirt was cotton based on the statements \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim\", we need to evaluate the validity of the inference.\n\nThe first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The pants were denim\" is a simple statement that asserts the pants are made of denim.\n\nTo make an inference, we need to use logical reasoning to connect the two statements. In this case, we can use modus ponens, a logical rule of inference that allows us to deduce a conclusion based on two premises. The conclusion is derived from the first premise (if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim) and the second premise (the pants were denim).\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that the shirt was cotton based on the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
