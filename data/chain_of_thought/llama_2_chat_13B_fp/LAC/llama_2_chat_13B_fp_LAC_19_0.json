Jen watched basketball.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can logically infer that Tom watched football based on these premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\nPremise 1 states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nPremise 2 states that Jen watched basketball. This means that Jen did, in fact, watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these premises. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, we are also given that Jen did watch basketball. Therefore, we can infer that Tom must have watched football.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
