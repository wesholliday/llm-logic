Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can logically infer that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris would not have finished the race either.\n\n2. Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If Alex did not finish the race, then we know that Chris did not finish the race either (based on statement 1). But we are also told that Chris did finish the race (based on statement 2). This means that we can logically infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
