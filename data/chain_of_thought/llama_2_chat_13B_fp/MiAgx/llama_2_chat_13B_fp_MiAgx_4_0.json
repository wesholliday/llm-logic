Similarly, if the gribble is in the snork wozzle, then it is possible that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle, but we cannot confirm that it is definitely there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle\" based on the given sentences.\n\nAnswer: No",
