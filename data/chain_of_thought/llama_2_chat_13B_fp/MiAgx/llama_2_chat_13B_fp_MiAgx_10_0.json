However, it does not explicitly state that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble.\n\nTo infer \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble,\" we need to make an assumption that the possibility mentioned in the original statement is true. In other words, we need to assume that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble\" is not directly implied in the original statement. Instead, it requires an additional assumption to be made based on the possibility mentioned in the statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
