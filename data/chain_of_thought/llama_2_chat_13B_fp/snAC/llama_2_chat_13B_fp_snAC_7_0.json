Chris finished the race (premise 2)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Alex finished the race. To determine this, we can use logical inference to reason as follows:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (premise 1)\nChris finished the race (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race and Chris finished the race.\n\nThis is a logical tautology, meaning that the statement is always true regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
