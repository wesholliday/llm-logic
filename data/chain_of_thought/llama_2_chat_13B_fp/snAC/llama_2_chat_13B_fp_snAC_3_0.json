The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the book was written by James. To determine this, we can use logical reasoning and the rules of logic.\n\nFirst, we can assume that the book is a mystery novel, based on premise 2. This means that the book has certain characteristics that are typical of mystery novels, such as a puzzle or problem to be solved, clues and red herrings, and a suspenseful plot.\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise. If the book was written by James, then it must have been written by someone named James. This means that there must be a person named James who wrote the book.\n\nHowever, just because the book is a mystery novel and was written by someone named James, it does not necessarily follow that the person named James who wrote the book is the same person named James who is the subject of the first premise. In other words, there could be two different people named James, one who wrote the book and one who is the subject of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, it does not necessarily follow that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
