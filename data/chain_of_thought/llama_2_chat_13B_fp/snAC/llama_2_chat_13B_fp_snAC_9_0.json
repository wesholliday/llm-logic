            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (assuming this is true)\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt (assuming this is true)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Lisa bought the red shirt. To determine this, we need to evaluate the truth of the conditional statement:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nWe know that Mark did buy the blue shirt, so we need to determine if the conditional statement is true. To do this, we need to consider the opposite of the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt). If the opposite of the antecedent is true, then the conditional statement is false.\n\nSo, we need to ask ourselves: Is it possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt?\n\nIf Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt, because the premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the premise would be false.\n\nHowever, we are assuming that Mark did buy the blue shirt, so it is not possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the conditional statement is true, and it follows that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
