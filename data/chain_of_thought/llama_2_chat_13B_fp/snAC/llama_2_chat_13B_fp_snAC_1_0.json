            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (assuming this is true)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (this is given as true)\n\nWe want to know if it follows that Mary was at the wedding. To determine this, we can use logical inference to draw a conclusion based on the premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n\"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nThis premise is saying that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding. It is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Mary attending the wedding\" and the conclusion is \"Sue attending the wedding\".\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n\"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nThis premise is saying that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nSo, we can use the first premise to infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. Since Sue was at the wedding (according to the second premise), we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
