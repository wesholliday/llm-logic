However, it does not necessarily imply that the movie will have subtitles.\n\nTo infer that the movie might be in English and have subtitles, we need additional information. For example, if we know that the movie is a foreign film, it is more likely that it will have subtitles. However, without this additional information, we cannot infer that the movie will have subtitles based solely on the fact that it might be in English.\n\nAnswer: no",
