However, it does not necessarily imply that the package will be delivered today and signed for.\n\nTo infer \"The package might be delivered today and signed for,\" we need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the delivery person always requires a signature upon delivery, then we can infer that the package might be delivered today and signed for. However, without this additional information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
