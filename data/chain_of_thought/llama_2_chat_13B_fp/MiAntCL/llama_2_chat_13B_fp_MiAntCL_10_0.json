            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The document might be signed\" implies that the document has not been signed yet, as it is a possibility rather than a certainty. However, if the document is signed, it does not necessarily follow that it will be notarized. Notarization is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing their signature, and it is not explicitly mentioned in the statement \"The document might be signed.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document might be signed and notarized based solely on the statement \"The document might be signed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
