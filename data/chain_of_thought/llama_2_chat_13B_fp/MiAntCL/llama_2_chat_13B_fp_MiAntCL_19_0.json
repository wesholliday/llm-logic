However, it does not explicitly mention anything about references.\n\nTo infer that the application might be completed online and include references, we would need additional information or context. For example, if the application process is described as \"online,\" it is possible that references could be submitted electronically as well. However, without more information, we cannot definitively infer that references are required or included in the application process.\n\nAnswer: no",
