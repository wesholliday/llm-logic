Cleaning the room daily only ensures that the room is free of dirt and dust, but it does not guarantee the presence of fresh towels.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the room is cleaned daily, it is possible that fresh towels might be provided as part of the cleaning process. In this case, we can infer that the room might have fresh towels, but we cannot be certain without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
