However, it does not necessarily mean that the exam will cover all chapters.\n\nTo infer that the exam might be difficult and cover all chapters, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the exam is a comprehensive exam that covers all the material learned throughout the course, then it is more likely that the exam will be difficult and cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
