However, it does not provide any information about the budget.\n\nTo infer that the project might be completed by Friday and be under budget, we need additional information. In particular, we need to know that the project is currently within budget and that there are no unforeseen expenses or delays that might cause the project to go over budget.\n\nWithout this additional information, we cannot infer that the project will be completed by Friday and be under budget.\n\nAnswer: no",
