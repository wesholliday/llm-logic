It implies that there is a chance that the zinger may not have been fraggled, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not fraggled.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled,\" we need to consider the possibility that the zinger may not have been fraggled at all. If the zinger was not fraggled, then it is not the case that it must have been fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
