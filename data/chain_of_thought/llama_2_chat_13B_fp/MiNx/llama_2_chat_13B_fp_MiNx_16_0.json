In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the sneg was crampled based on the information provided.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled,\" we need to consider the possibility that the sneg might not have been crampled. If the sneg was not crampled, then it is not the case that the sneg must have been crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
