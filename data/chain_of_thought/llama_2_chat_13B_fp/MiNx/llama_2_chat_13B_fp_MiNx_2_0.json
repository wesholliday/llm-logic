In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the wug was flooped.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped,\" we need to consider the negation of the statement \"The wug must have been flooped.\" This negation would be \"It is not the case that the wug must have been flooped.\"\n\nSince we have already established that the possibility of the wug not being flooped is not ruled out, we can infer that the negation of \"The wug must have been flooped\" is true, and therefore we can conclude that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
