It suggests that there is a lack of evidence or information that would confirm the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled,\" we need to consider the negation of the original statement. If the smonk might not have been vreebled, then it is not necessarily the case that the smonk must have been vreebled. In other words, the lack of evidence for the smonk being vreebled does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
