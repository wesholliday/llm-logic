It does not necessarily mean that the clug was not fleeked, but rather that we cannot be certain either way.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" would require additional information or context. Without more information, we cannot rule out the possibility that the clug was fleeked, even if it is uncertain.\n\nAnswer: no",
