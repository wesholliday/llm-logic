In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the twonk was plinked based on the information provided.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked,\" we need to consider the negation of the statement \"The twonk might have been plinked.\" This negation would be \"It's not the case that the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nHowever, this negation is not logically equivalent to the original statement \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\" The latter statement only implies that the twonk might not have been plinked, while the former statement implies that the twonk was definitely not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" from the statement \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
