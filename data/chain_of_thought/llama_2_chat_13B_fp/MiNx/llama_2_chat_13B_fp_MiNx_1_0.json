In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the flugel was blimmed based on this statement alone.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed,\" we need additional information or context. The statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" only suggests that blimming the flugel is not a certainty, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that it did not happen.\n\nAnswer: no",
