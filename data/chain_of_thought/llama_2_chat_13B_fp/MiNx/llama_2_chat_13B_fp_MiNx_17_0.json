In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the flob was skizzled based on this statement alone.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled,\" we would need additional information or context to rule out the possibility that the flob was not skizzled. Without such information, we can only say that the flob might or might not have been skizzled, but we cannot conclude with certainty that it was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
