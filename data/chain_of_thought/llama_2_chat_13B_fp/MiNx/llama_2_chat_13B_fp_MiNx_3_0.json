It implies that there is a lack of evidence or information to confirm whether the splat has been morphed or not.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" from this statement, we need to consider the possibility that the splat might not have been morphed, and the lack of evidence to support the idea that it was morphed. This means that we cannot assume that the splat was definitely morphed, and we must consider the possibility that it was not.\n\nAnswer: no",
