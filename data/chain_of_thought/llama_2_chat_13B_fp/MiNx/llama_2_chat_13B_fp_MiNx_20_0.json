In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the fleeg was bluttered based on the information provided.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered,\" we need to consider the negation of the original statement. If the fleeg might not have been bluttered, then it is possible that the fleeg was not bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
