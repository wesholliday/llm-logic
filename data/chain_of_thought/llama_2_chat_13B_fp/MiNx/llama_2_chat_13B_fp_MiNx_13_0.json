In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the glip was slogged based on the information provided.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged,\" we need to consider the negation of the statement \"The glip might have been slogged.\" This negation would be \"It's not the case that the glip was slogged.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that the glip must have been slogged. However, we can infer that the possibility of the glip not being slogged is not ruled out.\n\nAnswer: no",
