In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the flug was blummed.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed,\" we need to consider the negation of the original statement. If the flug might not have been blummed, then it is possible that it was not blummed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it must have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
