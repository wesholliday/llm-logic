In other words, we cannot conclude with certainty that the dreb was vroomed based on the given statement.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroomed,\" we need to consider the negation of the statement \"The dreb might have been vroomed.\" This negation would be \"It's not the case that the dreb was vroomed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement \"The dreb might not have been vroomed,\" we can infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroomed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
