In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily prove that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked,\" we would need additional information or evidence to confirm that the whiffle was not shanked. Without such evidence, we can only say that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked, but we cannot conclude with certainty that it was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
