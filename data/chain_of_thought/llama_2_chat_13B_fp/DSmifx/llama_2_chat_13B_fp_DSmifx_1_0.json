This means that if the flugel is not zargled, it is necessarily blimmed.\n\nThe second statement 'The flugel might not be zargled' implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationships between these two statements. If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed (based on the first statement). However, we are also told that the flugel might not be zargled (based on the second statement). This means that there is a possibility that the flugel is not blimmed, even if it is not zargled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel is blimmed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
