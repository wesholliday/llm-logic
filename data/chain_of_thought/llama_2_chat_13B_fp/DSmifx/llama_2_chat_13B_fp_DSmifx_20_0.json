If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered, according to the first statement. However, we are also told that the fleeg might not be surned, which means that it might not be bluttered either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty whether the fleeg is bluttered or not. The statements do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
