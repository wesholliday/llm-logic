If Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAdditionally, we know that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but we cannot rule out the possibility that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the information provided. While it is possible that Fido is inside, we cannot rule out the possibility that Fido is in the garden or somewhere else. The information provided only tells us that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but it does not provide enough information to infer that Fido is definitely inside.",
