Since it cannot be in both places at once, we can deduce that it is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, which means that it is possible that it is not there. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on the fact that it might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer: no",
