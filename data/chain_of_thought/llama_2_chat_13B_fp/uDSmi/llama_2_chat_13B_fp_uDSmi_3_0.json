Therefore, if we assume that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nHowever, the statement also mentions that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, which means that we cannot definitively say that the keys are in the drawer based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: no",
