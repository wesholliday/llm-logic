This means that the fleeg is not obligated to be surned, and it is possible for the fleeg to exist without being surned.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered' presents two exclusive options for the fleeg: either it must be surned or it is bluttered. If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered, since there are no other options.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that if the fleeg is not surned, then it is bluttered. This is because the first statement implies that there is no requirement for the fleeg to be surned, and the second statement implies that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
