Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the shank is plooked. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the shank is not nugged, so we can eliminate that possibility. This means that the shank must be either plooked or there is no possibility that it is nugged or plooked.\n\nNow, we look at the second statement: Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked. This statement tells us that there is no possibility that the shank is nugged, so the only possibility left is that it is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
