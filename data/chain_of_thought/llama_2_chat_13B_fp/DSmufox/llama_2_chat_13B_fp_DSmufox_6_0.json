Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the grommet is sploffed. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the grommet cannot be plopped. This means that the grommet is not in a state of being plopped. However, this statement does not provide any information about the state of the grommet being sploffed.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed. However, we already know from statement 1 that the grommet cannot be plopped. Therefore, the only possible conclusion we can draw from statement 2 is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
