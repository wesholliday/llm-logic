Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sprocket is cranked. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the sprocket is not daggled, so we can eliminate that possibility. This means that the sprocket must be either cranked or something else (since we have already eliminated the possibility of it being daggled).\n\nSecond, we are told that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
