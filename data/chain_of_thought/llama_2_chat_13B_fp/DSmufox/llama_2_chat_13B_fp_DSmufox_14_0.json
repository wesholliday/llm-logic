To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1: \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged\". This statement tells us that the clug is not required to be snugged. This information is not helpful in determining whether the clug is fleeked, so we can set it aside for now.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked\". This statement tells us that the clug must be either snugged or fleeked. Since we know that the clug is not required to be snugged (from statement 1), we can infer that the clug must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
