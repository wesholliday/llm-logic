This means that the glip has the freedom to be in any state it wants, including being slogged.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible states of the glip:\n\n* If the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged (Statement 2).\n* If the glip is tragged, then it is not slogged (Statement 1).\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
