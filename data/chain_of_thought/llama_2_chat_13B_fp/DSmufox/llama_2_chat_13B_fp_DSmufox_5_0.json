Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the zinger is fraggled. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the zinger cannot be smoogled. This means that if the zinger were smoogled, it would not be the case that the zinger must be smoogled. In other words, the zinger cannot be smoogled, so we cannot infer that it is fraggled based on this statement alone.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. This means that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled. However, we already know that the zinger cannot be smoogled, so the only possible conclusion is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
