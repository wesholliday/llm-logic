To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the flugel is not necessarily zargled. This means that there is no guarantee that the flugel is zargled, but it also means that it is possible that the flugel is zargled.\n\nNext, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed. This means that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements. If the flugel is zargled, then both statements are true: the flugel must be zargled, and it is not the case that the flugel must be zargled. However, if the flugel is not zargled, then statement 1 is false, and statement 2 implies that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed. This is because if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed, and we have already established that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
