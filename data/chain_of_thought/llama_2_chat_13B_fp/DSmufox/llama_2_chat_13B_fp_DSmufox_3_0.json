This statement does not provide any information about the morphing status of the splat.\n2. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" means that the splat is either quanked or morphed, but it cannot be both.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The splat is quanked and morphed. This combination is not possible since we are told that the splat must be either quanked or morphed, but not both.\n\nCombination 2: The splat is not quanked and not morphed. This combination is possible since we are told that the splat does not have to be quanked, and we are also told that it is not morphed.\n\nCombination 3: The splat is quanked but not morphed. This combination is not possible since we are told that the splat must be either quanked or morphed, but not both.\n\nCombination 4: The splat is morphed but not quanked. This combination is possible since we are told that the splat can be morphed without being quanked.\n\nBased on the possible combinations, we can see that we cannot infer the statement \"The splat is morphed\" from the two given statements. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
