Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the dreb is vroombed based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the dreb must be spened. This statement means that there is no requirement for the dreb to be spened.\n2. Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed. This statement means that the dreb is either spened or vroombed, but it cannot be both.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The dreb is spened.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is false, and the second statement is true. Therefore, the dreb is vroombed.\n\nCombination 2: The dreb is not spened.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false. Therefore, the dreb is not vroombed.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that the dreb is vroombed. The statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
