Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smonk is vreebled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This statement means that there is no requirement for the smonk to be plagged. In other words, it is possible for the smonk to exist without being plagged.\n2. Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This statement means that the smonk must fall into one of two categories: either it is plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled, since there is no other option according to statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
