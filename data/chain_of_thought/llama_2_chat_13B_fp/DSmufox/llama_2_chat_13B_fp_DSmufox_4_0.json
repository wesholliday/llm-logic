To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1: \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\". This statement tells us that the fribble is not required to be crinked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the fribble is snurgled.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\". This statement tells us that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. However, we already know that the fribble is not required to be crinked (from statement 1), so we cannot infer that it is snurgled based on this statement alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements given, we cannot infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
