In other words, there is no requirement that the flug must be zimmed.\n2. \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\" - This statement tells us that the flug is either zimmed or blummed. There is no third option.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The flug is zimmed and not blummed (this is not possible, since the first statement tells us that the flug is not necessarily zimmed)\nCombination 2: The flug is blummed and not zimmed (this is possible, since the second statement tells us that the flug is either zimmed or blummed)\n\nBased on the above combinations, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
