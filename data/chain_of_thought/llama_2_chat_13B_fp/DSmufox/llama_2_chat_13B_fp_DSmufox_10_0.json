Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This statement means that there is no requirement for the wug to be garpled. In other words, it is possible for the wug to be something other than garpled.\n2. Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. This statement means that the wug must be one of two things: garpled or sproinged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged, because there is no other option according to statement 2.\n\nSo, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
