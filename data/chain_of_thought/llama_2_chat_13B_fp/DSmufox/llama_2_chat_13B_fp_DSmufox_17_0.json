Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flob is skizzled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. It's not the case that the flob must be movated: This statement means that there is no requirement for the flob to be movated. In other words, the flob is not forced to be movated.\n2. Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled: This statement means that the flob is either movated or skizzled. There is no middle ground.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements together. If the flob is not required to be movated, then it must be skizzled. This is because the only other option is that the flob is movated, which we have already ruled out. Therefore, the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
