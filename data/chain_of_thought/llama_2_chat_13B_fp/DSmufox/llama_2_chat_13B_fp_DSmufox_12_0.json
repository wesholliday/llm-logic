Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smip is shripped. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nThis statement tells us that the smip is not necessarily lupped. In other words, there is no requirement that the smip must be lupped. This information is not helpful in determining whether the smip is shripped.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n\nThis statement tells us that the smip must be either lupped or shripped. This information is helpful, but it does not directly tell us whether the smip is shripped. However, we can use this information to make an inference.\n\nSince we know that the smip is not necessarily lupped (from the first statement), we can conclude that the smip must be shripped. This is because the only other option is that the smip is lupped, and we have already established that this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
