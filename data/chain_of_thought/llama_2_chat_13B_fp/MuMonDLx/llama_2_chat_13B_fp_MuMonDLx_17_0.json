It does not provide any information about what happens if the blimple is not gribble.\n\nHowever, if we add the word 'or' to the sentence, we create a disjunction that allows for the possibility of the blimple being either gribble or something else (in this case, zizz). This is indicated by the phrase 'or zizz'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The blimple must be gribble or zizz' from 'The blimple must be gribble', but only by adding the word 'or' to the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
