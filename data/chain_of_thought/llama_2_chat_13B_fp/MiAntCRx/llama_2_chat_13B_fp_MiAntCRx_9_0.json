Based on the context of the sentence, it seems that 'frazzle' is being used as a verb to describe the state of being perplexed or confused.\n\n'Quibble' is also a verb that means to argue or debate pettily or over trivial matters.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can infer 'The flonk might be quibble and frazzle'. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between 'frazzle' and 'quibble'.\n\nIf we assume that 'frazzle' is a state of being perplexed or confused, then it's possible that a flonk that is frazzle might also be quibble, as they both involve confusion or argumentation. However, this inference is not necessarily straightforward, as there is no direct connection between the two words.\n\nAnswer: no",
