However, it does not directly imply that the glorp itself is zibble zizz.\n\nTo infer that the glorp must be zibble zizz, we would need additional information or context that suggests a direct relationship between the glorp and zibble zizz. Without this additional information, we cannot logically conclude that the glorp must be zibble zizz.\n\nAnswer: no",
