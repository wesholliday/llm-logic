Additionally, the word 'wozzle' appears before 'crunk' in the sentence, which may indicate that it is modifying the meaning of 'crunk'.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the word 'crunk' is being used in a specific way in the sentence, and that it may be the main focus of the sentence. Therefore, we can infer 'The quank must be crunk a wump' from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
