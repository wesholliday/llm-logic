The phrase \"and under budget\" provides additional information about the project's budget, but it does not affect the inference of the deadline.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the project must have been completed by Friday, but we cannot infer that it must have been completed by Friday and under budget.\n\nAnswer: yes",
