However, we cannot infer that the exam was difficult solely based on the fact that it covered all chapters.\n\nThere are several reasons why this inference is not valid:\n\n1. The exam may have been easy, but still covered all chapters.\n2. The exam may have been difficult, but only covered a few chapters.\n3. The exam may have been a mix of easy and difficult questions, covering all chapters.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the exam was difficult solely based on the fact that it covered all chapters.\n\nAnswer: No",
