However, we can infer that the meeting was at 2 PM based on the information provided.\n\nThe phrase \"and in the conference room\" is providing additional information about the location of the meeting, but it is not essential to the main point of the sentence, which is the time of the meeting. Therefore, we can infer that the meeting was at 2 PM, as this is the only time that is explicitly mentioned in the sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
