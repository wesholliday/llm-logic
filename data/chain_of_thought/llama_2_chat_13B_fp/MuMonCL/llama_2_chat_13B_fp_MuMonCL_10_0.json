However, the statement does not explicitly mention that the document must have been signed.\n\nTo infer that the document must have been signed, we need to use our knowledge of the purpose of signing a document. Signing a document is a way of authenticating one's identity and indicating one's consent to the contents of the document. In the context of a legal document, signing is a crucial step that confirms the document's validity and legality.\n\nTherefore, based on the statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized,\" we can infer that the document must have been signed, but we cannot be certain that it was signed by the person who created it.\n\nAnswer: no",
