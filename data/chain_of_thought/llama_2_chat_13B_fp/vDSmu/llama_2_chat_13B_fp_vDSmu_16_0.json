The argument has the following form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore A\n\nWe can see that the argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise asserts that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk, and the second premise denies that it is on the desk. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
