The argument has the following form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore A\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism, and it is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nNow, let's consider the truth of the premises. The first premise states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This premise is true because there is no other possible location for the remote control. If it is not on the coffee table, then it must be either hiding under the couch or somewhere else entirely.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This premise is also true because there is no reason to believe that the remote control is hiding under the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the truth of the premises, the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
