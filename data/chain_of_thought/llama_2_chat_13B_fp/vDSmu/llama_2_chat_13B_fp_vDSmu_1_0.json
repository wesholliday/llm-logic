            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and the truth of its premises. The argument has the following form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore A\n\nWe can see that the argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of deductive argument that uses the disjunction (either...or) to arrive at a conclusion.\n\nNow, let's consider the truth of the premises. The first premise, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" is a disjunction that asserts that Fido is either inside or in the garden. The second premise, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nIf we assume that Fido is not in the garden, then the second premise is true. In this case, the first premise reduces to \"Fido is inside,\" which is the conclusion of the argument. Therefore, if we assume that Fido is not in the garden, the argument is logically valid.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Fido is in the garden, then the second premise is false, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
