            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. The second premise asserts that the banana might not have been yellow. Finally, the conclusion states that the apple was not red.\n\nLet's analyze each premise and the conclusion separately:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow: This premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana must have been yellow) must also be true.\n2. The banana might not have been yellow: This premise is a possibility statement, which means that the banana might not have been yellow, but it could have been.\n3. The apple was not red: This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises. If the banana might not have been yellow (second premise), and the apple was red (first premise), then the apple was not red (conclusion).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical validity of the argument:\n\nThe argument is structured as a disjunctive syllogism, which means that it consists of two premises and a conclusion, where the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise is a possibility statement. The conclusion is a negation of the first premise.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because:\n\n* If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (first premise).\n* The banana might not have been yellow (second premise).\n* Therefore, the apple was not red (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
