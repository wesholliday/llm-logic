This premise is a conditional statement, and it is logically valid because it is a tautology. In other words, if the griffin was in the forest, then it is necessarily true that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This premise is a possibility statement, and it is not logically valid on its own. However, when combined with the first premise, it creates a logical contradiction.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the griffin was not in the forest. This conclusion follows logically from the premises, but it is not a tautology. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
