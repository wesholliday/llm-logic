            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This premise is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" The conclusion is that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This premise is a possibility statement, and it suggests that there is a chance that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Mary was not at the wedding. This conclusion is derived from the first premise and the second premise.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nIn this case, the argument is not logically valid. The second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which means that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, even if Mary was. Therefore, the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
