            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This premise is making a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion is not necessarily true if the premise is true.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This premise is a possibility, and it does not make any statement about the actual state of the truck.\n\nThe conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This conclusion is drawn based on the first premise and the second premise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument to see if it is logically valid.\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is true only if the condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the doll is plastic.\n\nHowever, the second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This premise is a possibility, and it does not make any statement about the actual state of the truck. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the truck was not metal based on this premise.\n\nSo, the conclusion that the doll was not plastic is not logically valid. We cannot deduce that the doll was not plastic based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
