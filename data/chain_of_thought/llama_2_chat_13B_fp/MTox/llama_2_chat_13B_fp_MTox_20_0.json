This means that the fleeg was not bluttered, as bluttering is a sound that the fleeg makes.\n\nSecondly, we know that 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, it would have made a sound, which is the opposite of what we know to be true (i.e., the fleeg did not make any sound).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered, as if it were bluttered, it would have made a sound and the statement 'The fleeg did not surn' would not be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
