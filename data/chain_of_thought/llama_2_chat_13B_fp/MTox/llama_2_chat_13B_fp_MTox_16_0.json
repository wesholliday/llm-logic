            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from the given statements, we need to evaluate the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first statement 'The sneg did not sproted the frink' implies that the sneg did not perform the action of sproting the frink. This means that the sneg is not capable of sproting the frink, or it does not have the ability to sprot the frink.\n\nThe second statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' implies that if the sneg was in a crampled state, then it would have been able to sprot the frink. This means that the sneg's ability to sprot the frink is dependent on its state, and if it is crampled, then it can sprot the frink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion 'The sneg was not crampled'. If the sneg was not crampled, then it cannot sprot the frink, as stated in the first premise. This means that the conclusion 'The sneg was not crampled' can be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
