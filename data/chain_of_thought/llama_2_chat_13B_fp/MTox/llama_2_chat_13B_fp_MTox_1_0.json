If we combine the two statements, we can deduce that:\n\nIf the flugel was not zargled, then it was not blimmed.\n\nThis is because if the flugel was zargled, it would have been blimmed (according to statement 2), and therefore, if it was not zargled, it must not have been blimmed.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: no",
