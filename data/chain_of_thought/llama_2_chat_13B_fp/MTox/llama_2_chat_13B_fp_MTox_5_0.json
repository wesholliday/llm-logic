This means that the zinger was not in a state of being smoogled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled. This means that if the zinger was in a state of being fraggled, then it must be in a state of being smoogled.\n\nNow, let's think about what it means for a zinger to be fraggled. Fraggling is a state of being, just like smoogling. If the zinger was fraggled, then it must be in a state of being fraggled.\n\nSo, if the zinger was not smoogled, and it was not fraggled, then we can infer that it was not in any state of being (neither smoogled nor fraggled).\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
