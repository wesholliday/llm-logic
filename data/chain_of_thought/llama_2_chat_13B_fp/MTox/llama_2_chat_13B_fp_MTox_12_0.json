'The smip did not lup the zoint' - This statement implies that the smip did not perform the expected action of luping the zoint.\n2. 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' - This statement implies that if the smip was shripped (i.e., underwent a certain process), then it would have performed the action of lupping the zoint.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical relationship between these two statements. If the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint, but since it did not lup the zoint, it must not have been shripped. Therefore, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
