It does not provide any information about whether the glip was slogged or not.\n2. \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" - This statement tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If the glip was not tragged, then it must not have been slogged, because if it was slogged, it would have been tragged. Therefore, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
