This means that the flob was not skizzled, as skizzling would have caused the flob to move.\n\nSecondly, we know that 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' implies that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have moved. This means that if the flob was not skizzled, then it would not have moved, which is consistent with the fact that the flob did not move.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
