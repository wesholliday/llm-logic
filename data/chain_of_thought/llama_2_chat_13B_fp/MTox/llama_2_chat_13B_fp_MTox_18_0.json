To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can logically deduce the third statement.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement: \"The shank was not nugged\". This statement simply states that the shank was not nugged, without providing any information about whether it was plooked or not.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". This statement implies that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the shank was actually plooked or not.\n\nSo, based on these two statements alone, we cannot logically deduce whether the shank was not plooked. There is no direct connection between the two statements that would allow us to infer the third statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
