            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. \"The sprocket was not daggled\"\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the sprocket was not daggled. This means that the sprocket was not in a state of being bent or twisted.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. This means that if the sprocket was bent or twisted, then it was daggled.\n\nNow, let's think about what it means for a sprocket to be cranked. A sprocket is a mechanical component that is used to transmit power and motion. When a sprocket is cranked, it means that the sprocket has been bent or twisted out of its normal position.\n\nWith this in mind, let's consider the two statements together. If the sprocket was not daggled (Statement 1), and if the sprocket was cranked only if it was daggled (Statement 2), then we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nIn other words, if the sprocket was not bent or twisted (not daggled), then it cannot have been cranked.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
