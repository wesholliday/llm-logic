This statement tells us that the wug was not in a state of being garpled.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'. This statement tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it must be in a state of being garpled.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the wug was not garpled, then it must not have been sproinged, because if it was sproinged, it would be garpled. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
