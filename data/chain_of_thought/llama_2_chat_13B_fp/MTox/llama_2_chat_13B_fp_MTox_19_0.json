This means that the smonk did not perform the action of plagging, which implies that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk would have plagged. Since we know that the smonk did not plagged, we can deduce that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
