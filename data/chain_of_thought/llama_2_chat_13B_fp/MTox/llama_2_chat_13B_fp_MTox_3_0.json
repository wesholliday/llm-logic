This means that the splat did not make a sound when it hit the ground.\n\nThe second premise is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This means that if the splat was morphed (i.e., changed in some way), it would have made a sound when it hit the ground.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: 'The splat was not morphed'. Can we infer this conclusion based on the premises?\n\nIf we assume that the splat was morphed, we can deduce that it would have made a sound when it hit the ground, which is contradictory to the first premise 'The splat did not quank'. Therefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
