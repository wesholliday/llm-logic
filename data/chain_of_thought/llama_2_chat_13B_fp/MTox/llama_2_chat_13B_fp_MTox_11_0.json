It does not provide any information about whether the flug was blummed or not.\n2. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" - This statement tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed. This means that if the flug was blummed, we can infer that it was zimmed.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements relate to each other. If the flug was not zimmed, then it cannot be inferred that it was blummed, because the second statement tells us that if the flug was blummed, it would be zimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flug was not blummed based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
