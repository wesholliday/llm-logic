The word 'or' indicates that there are two possible options for how the gribble could be blimpled.\n\nTo infer 'The gribble might be blimple by flim or it might be grooble', we need to consider the possibility that the gribble could be blimpled by both flim and grooble. This is because the sentence does not specify which option is correct, only that the gribble could be blimpled by one of the two.\n\nAnswer: yes",
