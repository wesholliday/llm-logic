In this case, the first sentence \"The gronk might be flump plonk or quimble\" does not explicitly state that the gronk might be both flump plonk and quimble. It only mentions two possibilities, flump plonk and quimble, but it does not combine them.\n\nTherefore, based on the given sentence, we cannot infer the second sentence \"The gronk might be flump plonk or it might be quimble\".\n\nAnswer: No",
