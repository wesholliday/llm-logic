However, it does not explicitly state that the medicine must be taken after meals.\n\nTo infer that the medicine must have been taken with food or after meals, we need to consider the context in which the statement was made. If the statement was made by a doctor or a medical professional, it is likely that they intended to convey that the medicine should be taken with food to ensure proper digestion and absorption.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the intended meaning of the statement, we can infer that the medicine must have been taken with food or after meals.\n\nAnswer: yes",
