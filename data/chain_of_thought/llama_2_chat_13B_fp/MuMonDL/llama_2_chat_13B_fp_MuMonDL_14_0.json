However, it does not necessarily imply that the contract was valid for a year or longer.\n\nTo infer that the contract was valid for a year or longer, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we knew that the contract was automatically renewed each year, then we could infer that the contract was valid for a year or longer.\n\nAnswer: No.",
