This statement does not provide any information about the book's location outside of the shelf.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the book must be either on the shelf or in the library because the statement 'The book must be on the shelf' implies that the book is required to be in a specific location, and the only two locations mentioned are the shelf and the library.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The book must be on the shelf or in the library' from 'The book must be on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
