However, it does not necessarily imply that the movie had English subtitles.\n\nTo infer that the movie must have had English subtitles, we need additional information or context. For example, if the movie was a foreign film, it is possible that it was shown with English subtitles to facilitate understanding for non-English speaking audiences.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that the movie must have had English subtitles.\n\nAnswer: No",
