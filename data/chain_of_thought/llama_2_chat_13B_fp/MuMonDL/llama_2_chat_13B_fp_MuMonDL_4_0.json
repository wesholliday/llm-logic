However, it does not provide any information about whether the meeting was actually held at that time or not.\n\nTo infer that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM or was rescheduled, we need to consider the possibility that the meeting may have been postponed or rescheduled to a different time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or was rescheduled based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
