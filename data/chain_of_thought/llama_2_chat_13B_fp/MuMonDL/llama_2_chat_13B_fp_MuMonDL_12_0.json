There is no mention of next week in the original statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the project must have been completed before the next week, because if it is not completed by Friday, it will not be finished by the end of the week. Therefore, we can infer \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
