However, it does not explicitly state that the room must be cleaned daily or as requested. To infer that the room must have been cleaned daily or as requested, we need to consider the context and the purpose of the statement.\n\nThe statement is likely intended to convey that the room was cleaned regularly, and the word \"daily\" suggests that this was a consistent practice. However, without additional information, we cannot infer that the room was cleaned only daily or as requested. It is possible that the room was cleaned more frequently or less frequently, depending on the needs of the occupants or the purpose of the room.\n\nAnswer: no",
