A formal event can range from a simple dinner party to a more elaborate wedding or gala, and it can be formal without being black-tie.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the event was formal, it is possible that it was also black-tie. Black-tie events are typically the most formal type of social occasion, and they usually involve men wearing tuxedos and women wearing formal gowns.\n\nAnswer: no",
