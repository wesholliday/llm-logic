If the item is out of stock, it means that there are no more items available for purchase.\n\nIf the order is placed and the item is out of stock, it is possible that the order will not ship. This is because the customer has selected an item that is not available for purchase, and the order cannot be fulfilled.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that the order will still ship, even if the item is out of stock. This could happen if the seller has other items in stock that can fulfill the order, or if the seller is able to obtain more of the out-of-stock item at a later date.\n\nAnswer: no",
