Oil helps to lubricate the engine's moving parts, reducing friction and wear on the engine, and keeping it running at an optimal temperature. However, if the transmission is shot, it is unlikely that changing the oil will have a significant impact on the car's overall performance.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
