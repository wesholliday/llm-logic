This means that even if I finish my homework, I will not be able to play video games because the computer is not functional.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games. The second premise (my computer catches on fire) negates the possibility of playing video games, regardless of whether or not I finish my homework.\n\nAnswer: No",
