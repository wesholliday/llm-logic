However, it does not necessarily follow that getting enough sleep and doing hard labor will also prevent tiredness.\n\nThere are several reasons why this is the case:\n\n1. Different types of tiredness: Sleep deprivation can cause physical and mental fatigue, but hard labor can also cause physical exhaustion, even if you have had enough sleep.\n2. Different levels of intensity: Hard labor can be more physically and mentally demanding than sleep deprivation, so even if you have had enough sleep, you may still feel tired after engaging in hard labor.\n3. Other factors: Other factors such as stress, poor nutrition, and lack of exercise can also contribute to tiredness, and getting enough sleep may not be enough to overcome these factors.\n\nAnswer: No.",
