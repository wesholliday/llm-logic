However, the pilot light is not a significant contributor to the overall heat output of the oven. In fact, the pilot light is only used to ignite the main burners and does not directly heat the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, if the pilot light is out, it does not necessarily mean that the kitchen is not warm. The main burners may still be on, and the oven may still be heating the kitchen.\n\nAnswer: No",
