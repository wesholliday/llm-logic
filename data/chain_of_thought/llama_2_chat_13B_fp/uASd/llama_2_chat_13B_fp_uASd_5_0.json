In other words, if the bill is paid, then the services will continue.\n\nNow, if the check bounces, it means that the payment has not been processed successfully. In this case, it is possible that the services may not continue, as the payment has not been received by the provider.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. The continuation of the services is dependent on the successful payment of the bill, and if the payment has not been successful (i.e., the check has bounced), then the services may not continue.\n\nAnswer: No",
