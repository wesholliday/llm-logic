The fact that it has been misrouted means that it has been sent to the wrong location, but it is still on its way.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that the package will arrive today simply because it has been misrouted. The misrouting may cause a delay in the delivery, and the package may not arrive today.\n\nAnswer: No",
