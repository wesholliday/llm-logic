To answer this, we need to evaluate the relationship between being asleep and barking.\n\nIt is unlikely that a dog would be barking while it is asleep, as barking is an active behavior that requires the dog to be awake and alert. Therefore, we can infer that if the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is not barking.\n\nAnswer: No",
