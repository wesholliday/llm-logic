However, the presence of a bomb going off at the concert would not be conducive to having a good time. In fact, it would likely have the opposite effect and lead to a dangerous and potentially deadly situation. Therefore, we cannot infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\n\nAnswer: No",
