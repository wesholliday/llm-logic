However, if we eat junk food, we are consuming more calories than we are burning, so we will not lose weight. In fact, we may even gain weight because junk food is high in calories and low in nutrients.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we exercise and eat junk food, we will lose weight. In fact, the opposite is likely to be true: if we exercise and eat junk food, we will likely gain weight.\n\nAnswer: No.",
