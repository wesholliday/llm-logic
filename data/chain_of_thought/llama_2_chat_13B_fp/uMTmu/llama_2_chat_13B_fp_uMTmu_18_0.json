            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" implies that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck must have been made of metal. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" means that the truck does not necessarily have to be made of metal, even if the doll is made of plastic.\n\nTo infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to assume that the truck is not made of metal. If the truck is not made of metal, then it must be made of some other material, such as plastic or wood. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" does not provide enough information to determine the material of the truck. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
