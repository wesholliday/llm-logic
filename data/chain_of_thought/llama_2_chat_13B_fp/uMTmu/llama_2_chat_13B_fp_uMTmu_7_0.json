This is because if Alex finished the race, it means that Chris did not finish the race, as the statement \"Chris must have finished the race\" is false.\n\nHowever, the statement \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\" means that Chris did not finish the race, regardless of whether Alex finished or not. This is because if Chris did not finish the race, then it is not the case that he must have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race, as the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
