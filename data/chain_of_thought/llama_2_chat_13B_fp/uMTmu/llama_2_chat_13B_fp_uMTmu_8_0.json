In other words, just because the vampire was awake, it does not necessarily follow that the mummy was awake.\n\nThe second part of the statement \"Also, it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" is a contradictory statement, as it asserts that the mummy was not awake, even if the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
