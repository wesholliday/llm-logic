The statement is based on the assumption that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, but this is not always the case.\n\nThe second part of the statement \"Also, it's not the case that the cat must have been outside\" is a negation of the first part. It means that even if the dog is inside, it is not necessary that the cat must be outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
