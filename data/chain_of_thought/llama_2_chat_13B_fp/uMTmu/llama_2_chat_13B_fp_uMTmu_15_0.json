If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that one of the premises must be false.\n\nLet's assume that Sam took a plane. In this case, Erin must have taken a train, but we are also told that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that Erin did not take a train, which contradicts the fact that Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
