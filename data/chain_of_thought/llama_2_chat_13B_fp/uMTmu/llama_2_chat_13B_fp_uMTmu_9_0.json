            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" implies that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, then Mark must have purchased the blue shirt. This is because the two shirts are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one person buys one shirt, the other person cannot buy the other shirt.\n\nHowever, the statement \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that Mark did not have to buy the blue shirt. This implies that Lisa may have bought the red shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that she did.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
