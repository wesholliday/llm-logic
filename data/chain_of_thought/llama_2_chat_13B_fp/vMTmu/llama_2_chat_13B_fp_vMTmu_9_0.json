            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument we are considering has the following form:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's first consider the first premise: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This premise is saying that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is necessary that Mark bought the blue shirt. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark cannot not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This premise is saying that it is not necessary that Mark bought the blue shirt. In other words, Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, even if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's think about the conclusion: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This conclusion logically follows from the premises. If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, but we have been told that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
