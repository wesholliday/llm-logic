            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine the logical structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe argument has two premises:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is:\n\nThe apple was not red.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This premise is saying that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana must have had the property of being yellow. This is a conditional statement, and it is a logical truth that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This premise is saying that it is not the case that the banana has the property of being yellow. This premise is negating the previous premise, so it is saying that the apple being red does not lead to the banana being yellow.\n\nNow, let's put the two premises together and see if the conclusion follows logically. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (premise 1), but it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
