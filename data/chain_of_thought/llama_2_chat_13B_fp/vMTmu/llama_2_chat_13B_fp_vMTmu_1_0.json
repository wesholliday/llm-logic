            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument we are considering has the following form:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's first consider the first premise: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This premise is saying that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must also have been present. This premise is true by definition, as if Mary was at the wedding, then she would have been present, and therefore Sue would have been present as well.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This premise is saying that it is not the case that Sue was necessarily present at the wedding. This premise is false, as we know that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nSo, we have a contradiction between the two premises. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, but the second premise states that Sue was not necessarily at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument, \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" cannot logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
