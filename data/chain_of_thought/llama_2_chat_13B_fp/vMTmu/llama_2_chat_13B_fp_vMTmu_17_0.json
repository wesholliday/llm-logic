This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This premise is in the form of a negation, which is also a valid form of argument.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Ben did not eat pasta. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, as if Kate did not eat salad, then Ben cannot have eaten pasta.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as it follows the rules of logical validity and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
