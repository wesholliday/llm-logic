However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nTo infer that the alien might not have visited Mars, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests the alien has not visited Mars. Without such evidence, we cannot make an inference about the alien's whereabouts.\n\nAnswer: No",
