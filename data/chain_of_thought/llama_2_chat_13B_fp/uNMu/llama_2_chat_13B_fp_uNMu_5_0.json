In order to infer that Jeff might not have played basketball, we need to consider the possibility that he did not play basketball.\n\nIf Jeff did not play basketball, then the statement \"Jeff might have played basketball\" would be false. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff might not have played basketball if we assume that the statement is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
