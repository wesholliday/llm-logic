Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose any of the first three options.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that Sue must have chosen pizza, because we do not know that she chose any of the last two options (pizza or sushi). In fact, we know that she did not choose sushi, because it is not one of the options that she did choose.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza, because we do not have enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
