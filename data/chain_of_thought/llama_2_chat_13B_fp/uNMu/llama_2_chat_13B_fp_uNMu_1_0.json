However, this statement does not provide enough information to infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we knew that Mary had a conflicting commitment or was unable to attend the wedding for some reason, we might infer that she was not present. However, without such information, we cannot logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
