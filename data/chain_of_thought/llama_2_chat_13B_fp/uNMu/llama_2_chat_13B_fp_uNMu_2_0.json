In other words, the absence of evidence does not prove the absence of the griffin.\n\nTo infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest, we need additional information or evidence. Without such evidence, we cannot make an inference about the griffin's presence or absence in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
