In other words, the possibility of the flob being skizzled is not a necessary condition.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob might not have been skizzled. This inference is based on the fact that the statement rules out the possibility of the flob being skizzled, which suggests that there is a possibility of the flob being in a different state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
