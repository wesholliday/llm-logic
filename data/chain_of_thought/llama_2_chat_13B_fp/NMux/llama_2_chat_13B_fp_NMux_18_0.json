In other words, it is possible for the shank not to have been plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank might not have been plooked. This inference is based on the fact that there is no evidence or requirement for the shank to have been plooked, and it is possible for the shank to exist without being plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
