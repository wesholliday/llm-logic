In other words, it is possible for the dreb to exist without being vroomed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb might not have been vroomed. This inference is based on the fact that there is no evidence or requirement for the dreb to have been vroomed, and it is possible for the dreb to exist without being vroomed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
