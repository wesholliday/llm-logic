In other words, it is possible for the flug not to have been blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug might not have been blummed. This inference is based on the fact that there is no evidence or requirement for the flug to have been blummed, and it is possible for the flug to exist without being blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
