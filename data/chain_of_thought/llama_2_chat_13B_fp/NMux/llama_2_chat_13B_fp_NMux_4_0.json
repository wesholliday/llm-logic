In other words, it is possible for the fribble to exist without being snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble might not have been snurgled. This inference is based on the fact that there is no evidence or requirement for the fribble to have been snurgled, and it is possible for the fribble to exist without being snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
