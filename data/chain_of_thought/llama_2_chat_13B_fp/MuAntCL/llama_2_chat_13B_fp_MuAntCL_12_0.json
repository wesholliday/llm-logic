The two statements are not logically connected, and there is no information in the original statement to suggest that the project was under budget.\n\nHowever, if we were to assume that the project was completed by Friday, we could infer that it was likely under budget, as completing a project on time and within budget are often related goals. But this inference would be based on our prior knowledge and experience, rather than any explicit information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
