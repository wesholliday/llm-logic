However, it does not necessarily imply that the document has been notarized. Notarization is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing the signing of the document.\n\nTo infer that the document must have been signed and notarized, we would need additional information or context. For example, if the document is a legal contract or a deed, it is likely that it would need to be notarized in order to be legally binding. In such cases, the phrase \"The document must have been signed\" might be used to imply that the document has been signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: No.",
