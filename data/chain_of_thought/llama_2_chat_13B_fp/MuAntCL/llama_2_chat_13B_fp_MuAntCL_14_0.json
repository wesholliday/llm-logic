However, it does not necessarily follow that the contract was renewable.\n\nTo infer that the contract was renewable, we would need additional information or context. For example, if the contract included a provision for automatic renewal or if there were other agreements or documents that outlined the terms of renewal, then we could infer that the contract was renewable.\n\nAnswer: No.",
