There could be cases where the package was delivered without being signed for, such as if the recipient was not present at the time of delivery or if the delivery person did not obtain a signature.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the package was delivered yesterday and we want to infer that it was signed for, we need additional information. We need to know that the delivery person followed the standard procedure of obtaining a signature from the recipient before leaving the package.\n\nAnswer: no",
