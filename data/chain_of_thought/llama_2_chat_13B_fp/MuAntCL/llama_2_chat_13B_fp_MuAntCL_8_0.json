There could be many reasons why the restaurant was closed on Monday, such as staff training, maintenance, or a private event.\n\nHowever, if we were to assume that the restaurant was closed on Monday for a specific reason, such as a holiday or a special event, it is possible that the restaurant served Italian cuisine on other days. But without additional information, we cannot infer that the restaurant served Italian cuisine on Monday.\n\nAnswer: no",
