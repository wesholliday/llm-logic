However, it does not necessarily imply that the report was submitted by noon.\n\nTo infer that the report must have been submitted by noon, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the deadline for submitting the report was noon, then we could infer that the report must have been submitted by noon.\n\nAnswer: No.",
