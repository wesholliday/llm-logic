Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the milk is on the counter based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the milk is not in the fridge, which means it must be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the milk must be either in the fridge or on the counter. Since we know the milk is not in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
