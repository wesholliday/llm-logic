Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies were hidden in the pantry, it would not be the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nPutting both statements together, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
