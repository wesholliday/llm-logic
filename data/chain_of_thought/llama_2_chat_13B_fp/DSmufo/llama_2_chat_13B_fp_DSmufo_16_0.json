Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the pen is in my bag. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction or if they are consistent with each other.\n\nLet's assume that the pen is on my desk. If the pen is on my desk, then the first statement is false, since the pen is not on my desk. However, this means that the second statement is also false, since the pen cannot be both on my desk and in my bag.\n\nNow, let's assume that the pen is in my bag. If the pen is in my bag, then the first statement is true, since the pen is not on my desk. Additionally, the second statement is true, since the pen is either on my desk or in my bag, and it is in my bag.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can see that the two statements are consistent with each other, and they do not lead to a logical contradiction. Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
