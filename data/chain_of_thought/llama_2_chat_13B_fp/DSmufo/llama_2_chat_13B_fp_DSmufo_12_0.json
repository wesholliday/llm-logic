Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the jacket is draped over the chair. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, so we can eliminate that possibility. This means that the jacket must be either draped over the chair or somewhere else.\n\nSecond, we are told that either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This means that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
