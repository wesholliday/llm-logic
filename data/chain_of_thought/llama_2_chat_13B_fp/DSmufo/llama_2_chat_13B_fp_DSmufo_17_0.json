Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. To do this, we need to determine whether the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or not.\n\nIf the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, then it cannot be stuffed in my backpack, because the two statements are mutually exclusive. In other words, if the scarf is draped on the coat rack, then it cannot be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nHowever, if the scarf does not have to be draped on the coat rack, then it could be stuffed in my backpack. In this case, the two statements are not mutually exclusive, and we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack based solely on the fact that it does not have to be draped on the coat rack.\n\nAnswer: no",
