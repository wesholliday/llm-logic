Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the remote control is on the coffee table. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's first consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control is either on the coffee table or somewhere else in the room.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that the remote control must be either hiding under the couch or on the coffee table. Since we know that the remote control is not hiding under the couch (from statement 1), the only possibility left is that it is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
