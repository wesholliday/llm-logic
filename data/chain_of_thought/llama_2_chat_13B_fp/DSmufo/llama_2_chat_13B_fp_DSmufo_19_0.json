Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the watch is charging on the dresser based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the watch cannot be on his wrist. This means that the watch must be either not present or in a different location.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the watch must be either on his wrist or charging on the dresser. Since we know that the watch cannot be on his wrist (from Statement 1), it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
