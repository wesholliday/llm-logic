Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the umbrella is in the car. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nLet's first consider statement 1. This statement tells us that the umbrella is not required to be tucked away in the closet. This means that the umbrella could be anywhere else, including the car. However, this statement alone does not provide enough information to infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement tells us that either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. This means that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car. However, we already know that the umbrella is not in the closet (from statement 1), so this statement alone does not provide enough information to infer that the umbrella is in the car either.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements given, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: No",
