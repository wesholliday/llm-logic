Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the toy is in the toy box based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the toy cannot be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy must be either not on the bookshelf or in the toy box.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the toy must be either sitting on the bookshelf or in the toy box. This statement is reinforcing the idea that the toy cannot be sitting on the bookshelf, as we already know from Statement 1.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. We know that the toy cannot be sitting on the bookshelf, and we also know that the toy must be either sitting on the bookshelf or in the toy box. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
