Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the newspaper is in the driveway. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, we know that the newspaper cannot be sitting on the porch, so we can rule out that possibility. This means that the newspaper must be in the driveway or somewhere else.\n\nSecond, we are told that either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway. This means that if the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
