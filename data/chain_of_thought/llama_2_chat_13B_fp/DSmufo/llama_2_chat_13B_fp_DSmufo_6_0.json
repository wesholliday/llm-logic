Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n\nOur goal is to infer the location of the phone based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. This means that the phone cannot be in the kitchen.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the phone must be either in the kitchen or in the living room. Since we know that the phone is not in the kitchen, it must be in the living room.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
