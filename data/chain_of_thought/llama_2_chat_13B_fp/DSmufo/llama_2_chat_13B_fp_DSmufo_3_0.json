Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the keys are in the drawer based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys are either in the drawer or not in the cabinet at all.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the keys must be either in the cabinet or in the drawer. This means that if the keys are not in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf the keys are not in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nSince we know that the keys are not in the cabinet, we can infer that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
