            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true.\n\nThe second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the falsehood of the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion of the argument, which is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This conclusion follows logically from the premises if the premises are true. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the antecedent of the first premise (Lisa bought the red shirt) is false, and the conclusion (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
