            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Alex finished the race\" and the consequent is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nThe second premise states that Chris did not finish the race. This premise is a simple statement that is not in the form of a conditional.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Alex did not finish the race. This conclusion is derived from the first premise and the second premise.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe conclusion of the argument logically follows from the premises. The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. The second premise states that Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, the conclusion that Alex did not finish the race logically follows from the premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of a deductive argument, where the conclusion logically follows from the premises with absolute certainty. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the only possible conclusion that can be drawn from the premises.",
