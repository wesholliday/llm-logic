            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a certain condition (the car being red) and its consequences (the truck being blue).\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was not blue. This premise is a simple statement of fact, and it negates the conclusion of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the car was not red. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, since if the truck was not blue, then the car could not have been red.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, since if the truck was not blue, then the car could not have been red. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
