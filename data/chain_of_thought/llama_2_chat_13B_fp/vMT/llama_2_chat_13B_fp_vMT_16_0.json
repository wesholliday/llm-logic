            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each premise and the conclusion separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a certain condition (the shirt being cotton) and its consequences (the pants being denim). The premise is saying that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but it does not say that the shirt is cotton or that the pants are denim.\n\nThe second premise is 'The pants were not denim'. This premise is a simple statement that the pants are not made of denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument, which is 'The shirt was not cotton'. This conclusion follows logically from the two premises. If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton, because the first premise asserts that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
