            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This premise is saying that there is a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. This premise is saying that the condition specified in the first premise did not occur.\n\nThe conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball. This conclusion logically follows from the second premise, as if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball (since the first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
