            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of one statement (Mary was at the wedding) based on the truth of another statement (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the falsehood of the statement \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Mary was not at the wedding. This conclusion is derived from the first premise and the second premise, which together form a logical disjunction. In other words, the argument asserts that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of this argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, let's assume that the premises are true. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (first premise). And if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding (second premise). Therefore, the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
