This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of the conclusion (Bob chose pasta) if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true.\n\nThe second premise states that Bob did not choose pasta. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the falsehood of the conclusion (Bob chose pasta) if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Sue did not choose pizza. This conclusion follows logically from the premises, since if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza (by the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
