            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of one statement (the mummy was awake) based on the satisfaction of another statement (the vampire was awake).\n\nThe second premise states that the mummy was not awake. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the falsehood of the statement \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the vampire was not awake. This conclusion is derived from the first premise and the second premise. Specifically, if the mummy was not awake, and if the vampire was awake only if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of this argument. To do this, we need to ask ourselves whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to ask ourselves whether the argument is logically sound.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. The second premise states that the mummy was not awake. Therefore, the conclusion that the vampire was not awake logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn other words, the argument is logically sound because it is based on the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion. The premises entail the conclusion, and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
