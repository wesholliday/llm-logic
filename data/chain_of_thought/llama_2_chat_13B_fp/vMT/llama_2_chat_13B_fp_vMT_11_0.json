This is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"the cake was chocolate.\" The second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to consider what would happen if the premises were true. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry, according to the first premise. However, the second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry. This means that the premises are in conflict with each other, and the conclusion cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
