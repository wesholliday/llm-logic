            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the conclusion (the banana was yellow) is dependent on the truth of the antecedent (the apple was red).\n\nThe second premise states that the banana was not yellow. This is a negative statement, which means that the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe conclusion is that the apple was not red. This conclusion is derived from the fact that the banana was not yellow, according to the first premise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument to see if it is logically valid.\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Premise 1)\nThe banana was not yellow. (Premise 2)\nTherefore, the apple was not red. (Conclusion)\n\nHere's where we can see the problem with the argument. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Just because the banana was not yellow, it does not mean that the apple was not red. There could be other reasons why the banana was not yellow, unrelated to the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
