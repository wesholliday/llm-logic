This is because the statement is saying that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake, and there is no information provided about the mummy's awakening state independent of the vampire's.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake, because the statement only provides information about the relationship between the two entities in one direction (i.e. if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake).\n\nAnswer: yes",
