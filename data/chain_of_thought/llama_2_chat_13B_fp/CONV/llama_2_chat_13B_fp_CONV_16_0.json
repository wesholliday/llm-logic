            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' and 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton'.\n\nThe first statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' implies that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants are made of denim. This statement is a conditional statement, and the condition is 'the shirt is made of cotton'.\n\nTo infer the second statement 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton', we need to reverse the condition of the first statement. In other words, we need to replace 'the shirt is made of cotton' with 'the pants are made of denim' in the first statement.\n\nSo, the inferred statement 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton' is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', but with the conditions reversed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
