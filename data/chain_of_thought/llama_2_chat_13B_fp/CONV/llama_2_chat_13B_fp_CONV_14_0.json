            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the common premise between the two statements. In this case, the common premise is 'the bear and the wolf'.\n\nNext, we need to identify the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion of each statement. In the first statement, the premise 'the bear was in the case' logically implies the conclusion 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion of the first statement logically implies the premise of the second statement. In other words, we need to determine if 'the wolf was in the den' logically implies 'the bear was in the case'.\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called contrapositive reasoning. We can negate the conclusion of the first statement and see if it logically implies the premise of the second statement.\n\nSo, negating the conclusion of the first statement, we get 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the case'.\n\nNow, we can see that this negated conclusion does not logically imply the premise of the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' from the given statement 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: no",
