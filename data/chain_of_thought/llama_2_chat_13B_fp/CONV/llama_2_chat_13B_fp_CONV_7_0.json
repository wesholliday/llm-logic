This is because the word \"if\" implies a condition that must be met in order for the statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have also finished the race, because if Chris finished the race, then the condition of Alex finishing the race has already been met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
