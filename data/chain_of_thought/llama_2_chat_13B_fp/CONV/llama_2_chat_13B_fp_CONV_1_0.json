However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if Sue attended the wedding, then Mary attended the wedding.\n\nTo infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" we need additional information or assumptions. For example, if we know that Mary and Sue are always together, then we could infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding. However, without this additional information, we cannot infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
