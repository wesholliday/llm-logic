This implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat pasta (since she ate salad instead).\n\nNow, we need to reverse the order of the conditions to infer the opposite statement. So, we can say that if Kate ate salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, the inference is 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: no",
