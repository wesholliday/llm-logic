            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' implies that James' authorship of the book is a sufficient condition for the book to be a mystery novel. In other words, if the book was written by James, then it is guaranteed to be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James'. This statement is the converse of the first statement, meaning that if the book is a mystery novel, then James must have written it.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement alone. The first statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not imply that if the book is a mystery novel, then James must have written it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
