This is because the two statements are mutually exclusive, meaning that if Sam took a plane, then Erin cannot have taken a train, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane, and vice versa. This means that we cannot infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane' because it is not logically possible for both statements to be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
