            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This is a conditional statement, where the condition (the apple being red) implies the conclusion (the banana being yellow).\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the condition and conclusion of the first statement. In other words, we need to replace 'red' with 'yellow' and 'yellow' with 'red' in the first statement.\n\nSo, the inferred statement 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
