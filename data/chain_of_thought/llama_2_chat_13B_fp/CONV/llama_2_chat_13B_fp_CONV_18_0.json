            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' implies that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal. This is because the statement is based on the idea that plastic dolls are typically carried in metal trucks.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the logic of the first statement. This means that if the truck is made of metal, then the doll must be made of plastic. Therefore, the inference is 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
