            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park', we need to analyze the given information.\n\nThe premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is because the premise establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Lucy went to the zoo, we can infer that Joe must have gone to the park, as the cause (Lucy going to the zoo) implies the effect (Joe going to the park).\n\nAnswer: yes",
