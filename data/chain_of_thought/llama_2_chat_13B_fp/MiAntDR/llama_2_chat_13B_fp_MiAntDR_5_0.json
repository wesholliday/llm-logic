However, it does not explicitly mention tomorrow as a specific day for delivery.\n\nTo infer \"The package might be delivered tomorrow,\" we need to assume that today is not a possible delivery day, which is not explicitly stated in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the package will be delivered tomorrow based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
