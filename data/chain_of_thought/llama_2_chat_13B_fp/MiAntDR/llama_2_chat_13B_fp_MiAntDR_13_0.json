However, it does not directly imply that the movie will be subtitled.\n\nTo infer that the movie might be subtitled, we need to consider the possibility that the movie could be in a language other than English. If the movie is in a language other than English, it is likely that it will have subtitles to facilitate understanding for non-native speakers.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the movie might be subtitled based on the fact that it could be in a language other than English. However, this inference is not certain, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the movie might be in English only.\n\nAnswer: no",
