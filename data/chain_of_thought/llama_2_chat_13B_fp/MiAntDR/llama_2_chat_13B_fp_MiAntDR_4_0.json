This is because the phrase \"or cancelled\" suggests that there are two possible outcomes: the meeting might be at 2 PM, or it might be cancelled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that there is a possibility that the meeting might be cancelled, but we cannot definitively say that it will be cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no",
