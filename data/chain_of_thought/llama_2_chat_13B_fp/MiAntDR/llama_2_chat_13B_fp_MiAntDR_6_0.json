However, it does not explicitly state that the concert will definitely be postponed.\n\nTo infer that the concert might be postponed, we need to consider the possibility that the concert might be sold out. If the concert is sold out, it is likely that the organizers might postpone the concert to a later date due to high demand. However, this inference is not certain, and there might be other reasons why the concert is sold out, such as the venue having a limited capacity.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the concert will be postponed based solely on the statement \"The concert might be sold out or postponed.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
