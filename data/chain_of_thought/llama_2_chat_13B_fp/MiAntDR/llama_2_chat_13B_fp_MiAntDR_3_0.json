However, it does not explicitly mention the table as a possible location for the keys.\n\nTo infer that the keys might be on the table, we would need additional information or context that suggests the keys are more likely to be on the table than in the drawer. Without such information, we cannot infer that the keys might be on the table based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
