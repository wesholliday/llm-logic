Each independent clause has a different verb: \"crunk\" and \"quibble\".\n\nTo infer the second sentence \"The plonk might crunk blurble frozz and it might quibble to the zooble\", we need to assume that both independent clauses are true. In other words, we need to assume that the plonk might both crunk and quibble.\n\nAnswer: no",
