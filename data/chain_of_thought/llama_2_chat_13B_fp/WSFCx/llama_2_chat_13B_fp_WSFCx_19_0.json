Each independent clause has a different verb: \"blurble\" and \"flibbit\".\n\nTo infer the second sentence \"The wump might blurble grazzle and it might flibbit snork\", we need to consider the possibility of both clauses being true simultaneously. In other words, we need to assume that the wump might both blurble and flibbit.\n\nAnswer: no",
