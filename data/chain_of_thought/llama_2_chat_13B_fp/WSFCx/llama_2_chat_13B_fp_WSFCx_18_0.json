However, we can infer that the zump might be both zooble quibble and blurble based on the wording of the statement.\n\nThe phrase \"or it might be\" implies that there are multiple possibilities for the zump, and the use of \"might\" suggests that these possibilities are not certain. Therefore, we can infer that the zump might be either zooble quibble or blurble, or it might be both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
