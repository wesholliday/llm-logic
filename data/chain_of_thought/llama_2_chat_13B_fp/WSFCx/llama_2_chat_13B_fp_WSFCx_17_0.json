In other words, the \"or\" in the statement implies a choice between two exclusive options, but it does not imply the possibility of both options.\n\nHowever, if we were to infer \"The zazzle might be zooble and it might be on froodle\", we would be suggesting that the zazzle could be both zooble and froodle, which is not explicitly stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
