The sentence does not explicitly state that both possibilities are true, but rather presents them as mutually exclusive options.\n\nTo infer \"The quork might frozz on froodle and it might flibbit on zump\" would require additional information or context that suggests both possibilities are true. Without such information, we cannot infer the conjunctive form of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: no",
