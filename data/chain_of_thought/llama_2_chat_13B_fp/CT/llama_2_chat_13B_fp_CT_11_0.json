However, if we assume that the statement is false, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry, as the statement only states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but it does not state that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
