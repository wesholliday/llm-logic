            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This means that if the apple has the property of being red, then the banana must have the property of being yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'. This statement is saying that if the banana does not have the property of being yellow, then the apple must not have the property of being red.\n\nSo, we can see that the two statements are logically equivalent. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, and if the banana is not yellow, then the apple must not be red. Therefore, we can infer 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
