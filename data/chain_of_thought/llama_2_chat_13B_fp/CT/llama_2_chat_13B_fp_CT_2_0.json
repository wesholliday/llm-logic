            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nIf we negate the first statement, we get 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'. This is the statement we want to infer.\n\nSo, to infer the negation of the second statement, we need to negate the first statement.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAnswer: No",
