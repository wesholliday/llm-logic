In this case, the statement implies that the robot also visited Jupiter. Therefore, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, it means that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's assume that the robot did not visit Jupiter. In this case, the statement does not provide any information about the alien visiting Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
