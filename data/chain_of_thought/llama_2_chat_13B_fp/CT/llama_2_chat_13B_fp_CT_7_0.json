In this case, the statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' becomes true, as Alex's finishing the race implies that Chris also finished the race.\n\nNow, let's assume that Chris did not finish the race. In this case, the statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' becomes false, as Chris's non-finishing of the race implies that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
