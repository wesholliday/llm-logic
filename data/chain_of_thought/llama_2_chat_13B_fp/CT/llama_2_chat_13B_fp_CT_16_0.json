In this case, if we negate 'the shirt was cotton', we get 'the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nNow, we need to check if the consequent 'the pants were denim' still holds true if the antecedent is negated. If the consequent does not hold true, then we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nIf the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent 'the shirt was not cotton' is negated, and the consequent 'the pants were not denim' still holds true. Therefore, we can infer that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
