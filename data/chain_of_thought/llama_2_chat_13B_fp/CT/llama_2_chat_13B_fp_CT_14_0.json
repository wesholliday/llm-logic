            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the premises of the statement:\n\nPremise 1: The bear was in the cave.\n\nPremise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' logically follows from the premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called contrapositive reasoning. We can reverse the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows.\n\nContrapositive of Premise 1: If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nContrapositive of Premise 2: If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
