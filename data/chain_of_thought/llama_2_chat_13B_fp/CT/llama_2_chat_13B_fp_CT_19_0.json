            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football', we need to evaluate the given information and determine if it logically follows.\n\nThe given information is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen also watched basketball.\n\nNow, if we negate the statement 'Jen did not watch basketball', we get 'Jen watched basketball'. This means that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom must have watched football, since the original statement implies a causal relationship between the two activities.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
