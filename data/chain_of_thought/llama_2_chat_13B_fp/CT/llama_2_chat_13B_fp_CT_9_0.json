            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a biconditional, which means that both parts of the statement are logically equivalent. In other words, if one part of the statement is true, then the other part is also true.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Lisa bought the red shirt, then we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot infer the reverse statement 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nTo see why, let's consider a counterexample. Suppose Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but Lisa still bought the red shirt. In this case, the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' would be true, but the inferred statement 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
