However, this statement does not imply that if Sue did not attend the wedding, then Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nTo infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that Mary and Sue are always together and never attend events without each other, then we could infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. However, without this additional context, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
