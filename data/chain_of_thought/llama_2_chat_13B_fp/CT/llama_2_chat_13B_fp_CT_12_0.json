            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the given information.\n\nThe premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer the statement 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. To do this, we need to negate the premise and see if it leads to a logical conclusion.\n\nIf Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is false. This means that Joe did not go to the park, because the premise is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
