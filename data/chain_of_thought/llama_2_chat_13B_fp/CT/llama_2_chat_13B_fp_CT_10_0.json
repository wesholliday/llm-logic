This means that the cat must be outside, as the statement states.\n\nNow, let's assume that the cat is not outside. This means that the cat must be inside, as the statement states.\n\nHowever, if the cat is inside, then the dog must be outside, as the statement states.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
