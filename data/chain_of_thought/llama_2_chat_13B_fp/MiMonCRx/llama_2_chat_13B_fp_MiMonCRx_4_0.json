However, the phrase \"might be\" implies that these actions are not certain or definite, and it is possible that the wibble may not be subject to either glorping or flimming.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the wibble might be flimmed, as the statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
