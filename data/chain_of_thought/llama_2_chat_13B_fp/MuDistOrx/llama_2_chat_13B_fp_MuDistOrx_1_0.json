The condition is that the zooble must be either blimple or flump a zizz.\n\nTo infer \"The zooble must be blimple or it must flump a zizz\", we need to consider the possibility that the zooble may not be both blimple and flump a zizz. If the zooble is not blimple, then it must be flump a zizz, and if it is not flump a zizz, then it must be blimple.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zooble must be either blimple or flump a zizz, but we cannot infer that it must be both blimple and flump a zizz.\n\nAnswer: no",
