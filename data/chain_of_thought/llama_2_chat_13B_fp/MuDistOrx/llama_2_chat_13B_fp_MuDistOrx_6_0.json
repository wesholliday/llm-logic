            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given sentence \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" contains two clauses connected by \"or\". The first clause is \"The blimp must gribble a flonk\", and the second clause is \"The blimp must gribble a wibble snorkel\".\n\nTo infer \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel\", we need to combine the two clauses using \"or\". This creates a new sentence where the \"or\" connects the two clauses, making it necessary for the blimp to gribble either a flonk or a wibble snorkel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
