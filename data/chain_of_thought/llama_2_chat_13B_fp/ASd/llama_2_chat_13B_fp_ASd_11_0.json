However, it does not necessarily follow that if you get enough sleep, you will not be tired if you also do hard labor.\n\nTo infer \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired,\" we need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the person who is getting enough sleep is also doing hard labor, then we might infer that they will not be tired. However, without this additional information, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
