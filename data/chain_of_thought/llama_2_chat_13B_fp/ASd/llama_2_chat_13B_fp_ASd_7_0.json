However, the presence of a pilot light does not directly affect the oven's ability to heat the kitchen. In fact, the pilot light is typically used to ignite the oven's burners, and once the burners are lit, the pilot light is no longer needed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm' based on the given premise. The pilot light being out does not have any bearing on the oven's ability to heat the kitchen.\n\nAnswer: No",
