However, the statement does not address the possibility of the check bouncing.\n\nTo infer \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue,\" we need to assume that the payment of the bill is a sufficient condition for the continuation of the services, even if the check bounces. This assumption is not explicitly stated in the original statement, so we cannot infer it with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No.",
