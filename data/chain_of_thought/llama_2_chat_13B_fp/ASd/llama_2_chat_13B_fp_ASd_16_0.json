However, this does not necessarily mean that fertilizing the lawn during a drought will have the same effect.\n\nDuring a drought, the lawn may still be stressed and unable to absorb the nutrients from the fertilizer, even if it is applied. Additionally, the excessive use of fertilizer during a drought can lead to further water stress and potentially damage the lawn.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we fertilize the lawn during a drought, it will be lush and green.\n\nAnswer: No",
