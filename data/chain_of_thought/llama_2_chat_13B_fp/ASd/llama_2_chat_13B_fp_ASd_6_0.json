If the speaker is wearing earplugs, it is likely that they are trying to protect their ears from loud noises. Therefore, if the speaker is wearing earplugs and the person screams, it is still possible that the scream will hurt the speaker's ears, even though the earplugs are supposed to provide some protection.\n\nAnswer: no",
