However, the statement \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off\" is a hypothetical scenario that is not necessarily related to the original statement.\n\nInferring \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" would require additional information or assumptions that are not present in the original statements. The bomb going off would likely have a negative impact on the concert and the people attending it, and it is unlikely that it would lead to a good time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
