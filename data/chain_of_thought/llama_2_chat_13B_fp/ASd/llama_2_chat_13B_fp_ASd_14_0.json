However, it does not necessarily imply that studying hard in a specific language (such as Chinese) is a sufficient condition for passing a test in that language.\n\nTo infer \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test,\" we need additional information that the test is in Chinese and that studying hard in Chinese is sufficient for passing the test. Without this additional information, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
