However, this statement does not explicitly mention anything about misrouting.\n\nTo infer \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today,\" we need to make an additional assumption that if the package has been misrouted, it will still arrive on the same day. This assumption is not necessarily true, as misrouting can cause delays and the package may not arrive on the expected day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" from the original statement \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
