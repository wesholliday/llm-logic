The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the scarf could be either stuffed in my backpack or draped on the coat rack.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be either stuffed in my backpack or somewhere else. Since we know it's not draped on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility is that it's stuffed in my backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
