The cat is napping on the couch.\n2. The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n\nIf the cat is napping on the couch, then we know that it is not playing in the bedroom, since the statement 'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom' is true. Therefore, if the cat is napping on the couch, we can infer that it is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nOn the other hand, if the cat is playing in the bedroom, then we know that it is not napping on the couch, since the statement 'The cat isn't napping on the couch' is true. Therefore, if the cat is playing in the bedroom, we can infer that it is not napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
