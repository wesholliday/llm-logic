The shoes are in the closet.\n2. The shoes are lined up by the door.\n\nIf the shoes are in the closet, then the statement 'The shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door' is true, and we have already established that they are not lined up by the door, so we can infer that they are in the closet.\n\nOn the other hand, if the shoes are not in the closet, then they must be lined up by the door, which is not the case, so we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
