The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the remote control is on the coffee table. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can deduce the location of the remote control.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nThis statement tells us that the remote control could be in one of two locations: on the coffee table or under the couch. Since we know that it is not under the couch (from statement 2), we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\n1. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\nThis statement tells us that the remote control is not hidden under the couch. Since we already know that it could be on the coffee table (from statement 1), we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the two statements, we can deduce that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
