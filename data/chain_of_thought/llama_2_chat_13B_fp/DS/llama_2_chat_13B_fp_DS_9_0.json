The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the missing puzzle piece is in the box. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nLet's consider the first statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\" This statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece could be either in the box or on the floor, but it cannot be both.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\" This statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor.\n\nIf the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, then it must be in the box, since it cannot be both in the box and on the floor. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
