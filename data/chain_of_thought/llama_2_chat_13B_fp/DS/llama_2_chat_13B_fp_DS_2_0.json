            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The book is on the shelf' from the premises 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' and 'The book isn't resting on the table', we need to evaluate the two possible cases:\n\n1. The book is on the shelf: In this case, the first premise 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' is true, since the book is indeed on the shelf. Moreover, the second premise 'The book isn't resting on the table' is also true, since the book is not resting on the table. Therefore, we can infer 'The book is on the shelf'.\n2. The book is not on the shelf: In this case, the first premise 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' is false, since the book is not on the shelf. Moreover, the second premise 'The book isn't resting on the table' is also false, since the book is not resting on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: no",
