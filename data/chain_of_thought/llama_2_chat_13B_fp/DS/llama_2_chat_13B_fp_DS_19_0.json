Therefore, we can eliminate this possibility.\n\nIf the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. This is because the statement 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist' implies that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist, and we have already eliminated the possibility of it being on his wrist.\n\nAnswer: yes",
