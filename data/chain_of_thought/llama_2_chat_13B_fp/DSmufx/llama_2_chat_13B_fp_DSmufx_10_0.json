It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\n\nThis statement implies that the wug is either garpled or sproinged, but it does not specify which one.\n\n2. It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nThis statement tells us that the wug cannot be garpled.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The wug is garpled.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is false, and the second statement is true. So, we cannot infer that the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nCombination 2: The wug is sproinged.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false. So, we can infer that the wug is sproinged based on these two statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
