In this case, the second statement is false, so we cannot infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nCombination 2: The grommet is sploffed and the first statement is false. In this case, the second statement is true, so we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
