We can start by analyzing the first statement. \"Either\" implies that there are only two possibilities, either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled. So, if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\" means that the smonk is not required to be plagged. This statement is negating the possibility that the smonk must be plagged. Therefore, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
