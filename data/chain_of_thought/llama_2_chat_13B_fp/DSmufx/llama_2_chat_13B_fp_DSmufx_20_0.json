So, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from these two statements.\n\nCombination 2: The fleeg is bluttered.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false. So, we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from these two statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
