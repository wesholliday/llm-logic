If the flob is movated, then it is not skizzled. If the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\"\n\nThis statement implies that the flob is not movated. If the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the flob is either movated or skizzled. From the second statement, we know that the flob is not movated. Therefore, the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
