In other words, if the sneg is not sproted, then it is crampled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\" This statement negates the first statement, which means that the sneg is not required to be sproted.\n\nSo, based on the two statements, we can infer that the sneg is crampled. This is because if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled, and we have already established that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nAnswer: yes",
