In this case, the second statement is false, so we cannot infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nCombination 2: The smip is shripped and the first statement is false. In this case, the second statement is true, so we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
