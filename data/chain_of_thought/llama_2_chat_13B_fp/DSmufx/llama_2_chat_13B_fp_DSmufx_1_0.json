It does not specify which one is true, only that one of them must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\"\n\nThis statement implies that the flugel is not zargled. It does not provide any information about whether the flugel is blimmed or not.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these two statements to infer whether the flugel is blimmed. If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed (based on the first statement). However, we already know that the flugel is not zargled (based on the second statement), so we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
