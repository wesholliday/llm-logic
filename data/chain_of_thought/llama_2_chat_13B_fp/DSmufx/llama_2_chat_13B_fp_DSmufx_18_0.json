It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the shank is plooked based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n\nThis statement means that the shank is either nugged or plooked, but it cannot be both.\n\n2. It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nThis statement means that the shank is not nugged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked, because the first statement tells us that the shank is either nugged or plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
