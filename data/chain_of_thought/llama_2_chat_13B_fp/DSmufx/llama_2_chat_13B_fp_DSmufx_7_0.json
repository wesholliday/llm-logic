Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked based on the given statements.\n\nIn Combination 2, the whiffle is not shanked and not tinked, which means that it is neither shanked nor tinked. This combination does not provide enough information to infer whether the whiffle is shanked or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
