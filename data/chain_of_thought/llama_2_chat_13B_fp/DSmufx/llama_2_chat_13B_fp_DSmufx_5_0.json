In other words, if the zinger is not smoogled, then it is fraggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\" This statement means that the zinger is not required to be smoogled. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
