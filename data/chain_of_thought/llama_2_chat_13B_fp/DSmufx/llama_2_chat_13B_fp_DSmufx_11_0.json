It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flug is blummed based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nThis statement implies that the flug is either zimmed or blummed, but it does not specify which one. So, we cannot infer that the flug is zimmed based on this statement alone.\n\n2. It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nThis statement tells us that the flug cannot be zimmed. Therefore, if the flug is not zimmed, it must be blummed.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. We know that the flug cannot be zimmed, and it is either zimmed or blummed. Therefore, the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
