It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the wug is flooped based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\n\nThis statement implies that the wug is either bimmed or flooped, but it does not specify which one.\n\n2. It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\n\nThis statement tells us that the wug cannot be bimmed.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The wug is bimmed and not flooped.\nCombination 2: The wug is flooped and not bimmed.\n\nIn Combination 1, the wug is bimmed but not flooped, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, Combination 1 is not possible.\n\nIn Combination 2, the wug is flooped but not bimmed, which is consistent with both statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
