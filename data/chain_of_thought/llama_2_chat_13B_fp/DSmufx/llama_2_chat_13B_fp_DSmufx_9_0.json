We can start by analyzing the first statement. \"Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked\" means that one of the two possibilities, either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked, must be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\". This statement is saying that it is not the case that the twonk must be plinked, which means that the first possibility, \"the twonk is varnished\", is the only remaining possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
