To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the fleeg was bluttered. Then, according to statement 1, it must have been surned. However, statement 2 suggests that it might not have been surned. This creates a logical contradiction, as we cannot simultaneously say that the fleeg was both bluttered and not surned.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
