To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the desired conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. This means that if the clug was fleeked, it would have been snugged, and there is no possibility that it was not snugged.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. The clug might not have been snugged. This means that there is a possibility that the clug was not snugged.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged (statement 1), and there is a possibility that it was not snugged (statement 2). This means that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked, even if it was fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
