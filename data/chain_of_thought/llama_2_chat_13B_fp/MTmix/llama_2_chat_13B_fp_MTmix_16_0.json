The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sneg was not crampled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. This means that if the sneg was crampled, then it would have had to have sproted the frink.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n2. The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n\nThis statement is saying that the sneg might not have sproted the frink. This means that it is possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink, even if it was crampled.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink, according to the first statement. However, the second statement tells us that the sneg might not have sproted the frink. This means that we cannot infer that the sneg was not crampled based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
