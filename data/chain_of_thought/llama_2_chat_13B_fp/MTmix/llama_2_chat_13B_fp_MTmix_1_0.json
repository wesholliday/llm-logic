The flugel might not have been zargled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flugel was not blimmed. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the desired conclusion.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the flugel was blimmed.\" If the flugel was not blimmed, then the statement is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. The flugel might not have been zargled.\n\nThis statement is a possibility statement, which means that it is true if there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled. In other words, this statement is true if there is even a slight chance that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nSo, if we combine the two statements, we can see that the first statement implies that the flugel was zargled, while the second statement implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled. Can we infer from these statements that the flugel was not blimmed?\n\nAnswer: no",
