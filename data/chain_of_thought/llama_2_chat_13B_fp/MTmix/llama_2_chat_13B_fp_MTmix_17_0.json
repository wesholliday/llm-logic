The flob might not have movated.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the flob was not skizzled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the desired conclusion.\n\nLet's first consider statement 1: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\" This statement is saying that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. This means that if the flob was skizzled, then it is not possible for it to not have moved.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"The flob might not have movated.\" This statement is saying that it is possible that the flob did not move.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that they are contradictory. Statement 1 says that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved, while statement 2 says that it might not have moved. This means that we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
