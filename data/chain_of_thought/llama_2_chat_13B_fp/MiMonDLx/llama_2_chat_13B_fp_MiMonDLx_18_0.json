'Blurble' and 'plimp' are not words, but rather made-up nonsense words that are used to illustrate the idea that the quibble might be about something insignificant or unimportant.\n\nBased on the context, it seems likely that the quibble is about something minor or trivial, and that the speaker is using the made-up words 'blurble' and 'plimp' to emphasize the idea that the quibble is not about something significant or important.\n\nAnswer: yes",
