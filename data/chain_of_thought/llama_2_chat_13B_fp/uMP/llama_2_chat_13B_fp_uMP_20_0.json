The apple was red.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This statement implies that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana would have the property of being yellow.\n2. The apple was red. This statement tells us that the apple does have the property of being red.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If the apple is red, then it must have the property of being red. And if the apple has the property of being red, then it must be true that the banana is yellow (according to statement 1).\n\nSo, based on the two statements, we can infer that the banana is yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
