Sam took a plane.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Erin took a train based on these statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nStatement 2: Sam took a plane. This statement confirms that Sam did take a plane.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If Sam took a plane, then it is certain that Erin took a train, based on statement 1. However, statement 2 only tells us that Sam took a plane, it doesn't tell us anything about Erin.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Erin took a train based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
