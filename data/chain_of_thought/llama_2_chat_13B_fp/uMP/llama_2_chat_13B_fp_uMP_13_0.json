The car was red.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the truck was blue based on these statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This statement implies that if the car had the property of being red, then the truck also had the property of being blue.\n\nStatement 2: The car was red. This statement tells us that the car did have the property of being red.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these statements. If the car was red, then it must have had the property of being red. And since the car did have the property of being red, we can infer that the truck also had the property of being blue, based on statement 1.\n\nSo, our answer is...\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
