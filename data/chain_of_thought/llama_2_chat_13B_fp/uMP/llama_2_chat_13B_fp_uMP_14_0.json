The bear was in the cave.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the wolf was in the den based on these statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This statement implies that if the bear is present in the cave, then the wolf must also be present in the den.\n\nStatement 2: The bear was in the cave. This statement confirms that the bear was indeed present in the cave.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If the bear was in the cave, then it must have been in the den as well, since the wolf was supposed to be in the den if the bear was in the cave. Therefore, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
