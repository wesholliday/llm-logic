The griffin was in the forest.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThis statement implies that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest. This means that if the griffin is true, then the unicorn is also true.\n\nStatement 2: The griffin was in the forest.\n\nThis statement means that the griffin is present in the forest.\n\nNow, let's combine both statements:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest (Statement 2), then the unicorn was in the forest (Statement 1).\n\nSince the griffin is present in the forest (Statement 2), we can infer that the unicorn is also present in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
