            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book was written by James.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the book is a mystery novel based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (in this case, \"the book was written by James\") is met. In other words, if the book was not written by James, then this statement is false.\n\n2. The book was written by James.\n\nThis statement is a fact, and it is true regardless of any other conditions.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between these two statements. Since the second statement is a fact, we know that the book was written by James. And since the first statement is a conditional statement, we can only infer that the book is a mystery novel if the condition is met, which is the case here since the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
