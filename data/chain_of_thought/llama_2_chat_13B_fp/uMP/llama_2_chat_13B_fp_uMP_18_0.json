            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The doll was plastic.\n\nTo infer that the truck was metal, we need to determine if the first statement is true given the second statement. In other words, we need to determine if the doll being plastic implies that the truck was metal.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck was made of metal. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"if the doll was plastic.\" Since we know that the doll was plastic, we can satisfy the condition, and the statement becomes true.\n\n2. The doll was plastic.\n\nThis statement is simply stating a fact about the doll.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that the truck was metal. The first statement says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since we know that the doll was plastic, it follows that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
