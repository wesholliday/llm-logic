The cake was chocolate.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the muffins were blueberry based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This statement implies that there is a causal relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n\nStatement 2: The cake was chocolate. This statement confirms that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since the cake was chocolate, we know that the muffins were blueberry according to statement 1. However, we also know that the cake was chocolate according to statement 2, which reinforces the inference we made based on statement 1.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
