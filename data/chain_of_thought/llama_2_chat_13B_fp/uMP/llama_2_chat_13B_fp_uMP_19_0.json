Tom watched football.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Jen watched basketball based on these premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\nPremise 1 states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nPremise 2 states that Tom watched football. This means that Tom did, in fact, watch football.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these premises.
