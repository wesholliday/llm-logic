Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the red shirt (since he would have bought the blue shirt instead).\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt. This statement tells us that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. Since Lisa bought the red shirt, we know that Mark did not buy the red shirt (according to statement 1). Therefore, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt, since he did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
