Mary was at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Sue was at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n2. Mary was at the wedding. This statement confirms that Mary did attend the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well, based on statement 1. However, we are also told that Mary did attend the wedding, which confirms that Sue attended the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
