The vampire was awake.\n\nOur goal is to determine if the mummy was awake based on these statements. To do this, we need to use logical reasoning to deduce the necessary conclusions.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nThis statement implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This is because the word \"if\" indicates a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n\n2. The vampire was awake.\n\nThis statement is a fact, and it tells us that the vampire is indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together and see what we can infer:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (based on statement 1).\n\nThe vampire was awake (based on statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
