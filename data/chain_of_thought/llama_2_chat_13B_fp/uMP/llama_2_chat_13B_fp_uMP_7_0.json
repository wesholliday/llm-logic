Alex finished the race.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Chris finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nThis statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nStatement 2: Alex finished the race.\nThis statement means that Alex did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (Statement 1)\nAlex finished the race (Statement 2)\n\nWe can infer that Chris finished the race based on the fact that Alex finished the race.
