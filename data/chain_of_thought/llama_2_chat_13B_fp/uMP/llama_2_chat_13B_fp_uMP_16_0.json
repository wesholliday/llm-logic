The shirt was cotton.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the pants were denim, we need to evaluate the logical implications of these statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the shirt was cotton. Based on statement 1, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that if we start with the premise that the shirt was cotton, we can conclude that the pants were denim.\n\nHowever, we are also given that the shirt was cotton. Therefore, we can start with the premise that the shirt was cotton and conclude that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
