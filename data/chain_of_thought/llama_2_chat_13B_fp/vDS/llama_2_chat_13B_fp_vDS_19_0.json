This premise is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it asserts the existence of one of two possibilities: either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n\nThe second premise states that the watch isn't on his wrist. This premise is a negative statement, meaning that it asserts the non-existence of something (in this case, the watch being on his wrist).\n\nThe conclusion states that the watch is charging on the dresser. This conclusion logically follows from the first premise, since if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser (by the first premise's disjunctive structure).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
