This is a disjunctive premise, meaning that it asserts the existence of two mutually exclusive possibilities.\n\nThe second premise states that the book is not resting on the table. This premise is a negative statement, meaning that it asserts the absence of something (in this case, the book resting on the table).\n\nNow, let's consider how the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf, since these are the only two possibilities presented in the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
