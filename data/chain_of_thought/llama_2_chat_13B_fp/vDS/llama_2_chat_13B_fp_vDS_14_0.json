If the premises are true, does the conclusion necessarily follow?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true, i.e., \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\" If the milk is not chilling in the fridge (which is the second premise), then it must be on the counter. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes",
