This premise is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it asserts the existence of two mutually exclusive possibilities.\n\nThe second premise states that the pen isn't on my desk. This premise is a negative statement, meaning that it asserts the absence of something (in this case, the pen on my desk).\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"The pen is in my bag.\" This conclusion logically follows from the first premise, since if the pen is not on my desk (as stated in the second premise), then it must be in my bag (by the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
