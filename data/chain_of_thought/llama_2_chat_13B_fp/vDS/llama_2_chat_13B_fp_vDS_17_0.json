This premise presents two exclusive possibilities for the location of the scarf.\n\nThe second premise states that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack. This premise eliminates one of the two possibilities presented in the first premise, leaving only the other possibility: the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack logically follows from the premises. The argument is structured in a way that eliminates one possibility and leads to the other, which is a characteristic of a logically valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
