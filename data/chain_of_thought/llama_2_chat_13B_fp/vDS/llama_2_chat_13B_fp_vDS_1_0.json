            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each part separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden'. This premise is a disjunctive statement, which means that it asserts that one of two possibilities must be true. In this case, the two possibilities are that Fido is inside or that Fido is in the garden.\n\nThe second premise is 'Fido is not in the garden'. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: 'Fido is inside'. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises. If Fido is not in the garden (as the second premise asserts), then he must be inside (by the first premise).\n\nSo, the argument has a logical form that is valid, known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a type of deductive reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion based on the negation of one premise and the affirmation of the other. In this case, the argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
