This premise presents two exclusive possibilities, meaning that the missing puzzle piece cannot be both in the box and blending in on the floor at the same time.\n\nThe second premise asserts that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This premise eliminates one of the two possibilities presented in the first premise, leaving only one possibility: the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, as the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
