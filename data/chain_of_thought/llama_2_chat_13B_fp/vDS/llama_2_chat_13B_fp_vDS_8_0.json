The argument has the following form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore A\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism, and it is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nNow, let's consider the truth of the premises. The first premise states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two possibilities must be true. The second premise states that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This premise is clearly true, as we are assuming that the remote control is not hidden under the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the truth of the premises, the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
