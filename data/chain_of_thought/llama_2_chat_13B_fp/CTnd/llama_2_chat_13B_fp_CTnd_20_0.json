This means that if a recommendation was made, it is likely that it was a weak or moderate recommendation, rather than a strong one.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the words in reverse order.\n\nIf we assume that the original statement is true, then we can infer that if a strong recommendation was made, then it is not a weak or moderate recommendation, but rather a strong one. Therefore, if a strong recommendation was made, then it is likely that a recommendation was made.\n\nAnswer: yes",
