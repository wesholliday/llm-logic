In other words, we need to assume that the issue was discussed in depth and see if the statement still holds true.\n\nIf the issue was discussed in depth, then it is likely that all aspects of the issue were covered and no stone was left unturned. In this case, it is unlikely that the issue was not discussed, as discussing it in depth would imply that all aspects were covered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was discussed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
