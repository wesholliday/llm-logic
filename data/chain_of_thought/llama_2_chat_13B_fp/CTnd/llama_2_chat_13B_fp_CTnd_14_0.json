In other words, if a meal is prepared, then it cannot be prepared carefully.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the following statement is true or false: \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\"\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the statement and see if it logically follows from the given statement.\n\nLet's assume that the meal was prepared carefully. This means that the person who prepared the meal took great care in doing so, paying attention to detail and using high-quality ingredients.\n\nIf the meal was prepared carefully, then it is likely that it was not prepared in a rushed or haphazard manner. Therefore, we can infer that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\n\nAnswer: yes",
