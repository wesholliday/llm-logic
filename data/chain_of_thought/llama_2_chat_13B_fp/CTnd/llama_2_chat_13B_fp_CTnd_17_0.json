This means that if the customer was greeted at all, it was likely a perfunctory or impersonal greeting.\n\nTo infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" would be a logical contradiction, as a warm greeting would imply a more personal and friendly interaction, which is incompatible with the idea that the customer was not greeted warmly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
