However, it does not necessarily follow that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\n\nTo infer that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered, we would need additional information or context. For example, if the statement \"If helpful advice was offered\" is negated, then it could be inferred that no advice was offered.\n\nAnswer: No",
