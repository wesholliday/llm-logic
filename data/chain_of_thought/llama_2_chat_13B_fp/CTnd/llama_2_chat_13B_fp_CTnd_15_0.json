            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\" implies that tidying the room does not necessarily mean that it was done thoroughly. This implies that there may be some aspects of the room that were not tidied, or that the tidying was not done with great attention to detail.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to make: \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\" This statement is the opposite of the original statement, so we need to determine if it is logically implied by the original statement.\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called \"negation\" to reverse the meaning of the original statement. If the original statement is true, then the negation of the original statement is false, and vice versa.\n\nSo, if we negate the original statement \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\", we get \"If the room was not tidied thoroughly, then it was tidied.\" This statement is the opposite of the original statement, and it is logically implied by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was tidied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
