            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' from 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables' implies that going to the store is a necessary condition for not buying vegetables. In other words, if I went to the store, then it is certain that I did not buy vegetables.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'. This statement is the negation of the first statement, meaning that if I bought vegetables, then it is certain that I did not go to the store.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' from 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables' because the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
