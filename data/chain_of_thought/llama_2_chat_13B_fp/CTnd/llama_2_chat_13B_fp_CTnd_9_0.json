To infer the converse of this statement, we need to negate the premise and see if the resulting statement is true.\n\nLet's negate the premise: \"If instructions were not given, then they were explained clearly.\"\n\nIf instructions were not given, then it is not possible for them to be explained clearly or not. Therefore, the negation of the premise is false.\n\nNow, we can infer the converse of the original statement:\n\nIf instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were given.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
