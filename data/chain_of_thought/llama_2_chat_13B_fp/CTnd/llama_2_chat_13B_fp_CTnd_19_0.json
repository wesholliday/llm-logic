In other words, we need to assume that the directions were explained clearly and see if it leads to a logical conclusion.\n\nSo, let's assume that the directions were explained clearly. This means that the person providing the directions made sure that the recipient understood them clearly and accurately.\n\nIf the directions were explained clearly, then it is unlikely that the recipient would need additional directions. Therefore, we can infer that if the directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
