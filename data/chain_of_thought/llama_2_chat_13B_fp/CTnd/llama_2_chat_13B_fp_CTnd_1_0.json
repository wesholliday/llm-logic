In other words, if it is raining, then it is not raining heavily or intensely.\n\nTo infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\", we need to reverse the logic of the original statement. This means that if it is raining hard, then it is not raining at all, as the two statements are mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: no",
