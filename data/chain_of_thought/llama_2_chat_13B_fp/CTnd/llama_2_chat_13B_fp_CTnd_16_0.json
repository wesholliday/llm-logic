However, this statement does not provide enough information to infer the opposite statement \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\"\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the job was completed quickly, we might infer that it was not completed well, as speed and quality are often trade-offs. However, without additional information, we cannot make the inference that if the job was completed well, it was not completed.\n\nAnswer: no",
