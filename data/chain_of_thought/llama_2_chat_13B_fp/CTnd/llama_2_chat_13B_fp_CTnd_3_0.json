This implies that if I did not eat a meal, then I must have eaten a large meal. In other words, the given statement is saying that the opposite of eating a meal is eating a large meal.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal, because eating a large meal is the opposite of eating a meal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
