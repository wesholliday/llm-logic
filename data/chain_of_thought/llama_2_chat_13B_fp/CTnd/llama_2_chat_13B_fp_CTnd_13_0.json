In other words, we need to assume that Alex exercised much and see if the statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise\" is true.\n\nLet's assume that Alex exercised much. This means that he exercised to a high degree or extensively.\n\nNow, let's apply the given statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" to this assumption.\n\nIf Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise much.\n\nThis statement is true because the word \"much\" implies a high degree or extent. Therefore, if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise to a high degree or extent.\n\nAnswer: no",
