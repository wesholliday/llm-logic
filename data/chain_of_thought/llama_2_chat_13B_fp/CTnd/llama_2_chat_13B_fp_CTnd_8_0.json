To infer the converse statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" would require a logical reversal of the original statement.\n\nHowever, this reversal is not necessarily true. Addressing an issue effectively does not necessarily mean that the issue was not addressed. In fact, addressing an issue effectively often means that the issue was successfully resolved or improved.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" from the original statement \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
