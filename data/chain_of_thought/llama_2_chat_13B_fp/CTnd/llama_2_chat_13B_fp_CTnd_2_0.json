In other words, if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise with a lot of effort or intensity.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the statement \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" is true or false. To do this, we need to analyze the given statement and see if it logically follows from the premise.\n\nLet's assume that Ann exercised strenuously. This means that she exercised with a lot of effort and intensity. Based on the given statement, if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise (because the given statement states that if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously).\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
