The premise states that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. This means that if Alex did exercise, then he did not exercise extensively or intensively.\n\nNow, let's look at the conclusion of the argument. The conclusion states that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. This means that if Alex exercised a lot, then he did not exercise at all.\n\nBased on the premise and conclusion, we can see that the argument is trying to say that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much, and if he exercised much, then he did not exercise at all. This creates a contradictory statement, as the premise and conclusion are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as it leads to a contradictory conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
