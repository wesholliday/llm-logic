The premise 'If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly' implies that if directions were provided, then they must not have been explained clearly. The conclusion 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided' is obtained by negating the premise, i.e., if directions were explained clearly, then it is not the case that directions were provided.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if the argument is logically sound.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
