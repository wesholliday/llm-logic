The premise states that if the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively, which implies that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. However, the conclusion states that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was addressed.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to evaluate the truth of the premise and the conclusion. If the premise is true and the conclusion follows logically from the premise, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was addressed, which contradicts the premise that if the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively. Therefore, the argument is self-refuting and cannot be logically valid.",
