The premise and conclusion of the argument are logically equivalent, meaning that they are saying the same thing in different words.\n\nThe premise 'If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly' is saying that if instructions were provided, then they must not have been explained clearly, because if they were explained clearly, then they would not need to be given.\n\nThe conclusion 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given' is saying that if the instructions were explained clearly, then it is not possible that instructions were given, because if instructions were given, then they would not need to be explained.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
