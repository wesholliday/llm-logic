A tautology is a statement that is always true by definition, regardless of the context or circumstances. In this case, the argument is asserting that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth, and if it was not discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. This creates a logical loop where the conclusion is essentially restated as the premise, without providing any new information or insight.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
