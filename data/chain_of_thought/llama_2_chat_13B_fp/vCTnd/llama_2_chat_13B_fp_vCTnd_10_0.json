            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a type of contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is obtained by negating the premise and then reversing the order of the premise and conclusion. The premise 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice' implies that if advice was offered, it must not be helpful advice. The conclusion 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' is obtained by negating the premise, and it states that if helpful advice was offered, then it must not have been offered.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if the premise is sufficient to support the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because the premise implies that if advice was offered, it must not be helpful advice. Therefore, if helpful advice was offered, it must not have been offered, which is the conclusion. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.",
