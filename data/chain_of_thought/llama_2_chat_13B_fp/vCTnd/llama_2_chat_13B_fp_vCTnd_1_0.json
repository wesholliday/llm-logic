To determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard' is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a condition (raining) and its consequences (not raining hard). The conclusion 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining' is the negation of the premise, which means that it asserts the opposite of what the premise asserts.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. If the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
