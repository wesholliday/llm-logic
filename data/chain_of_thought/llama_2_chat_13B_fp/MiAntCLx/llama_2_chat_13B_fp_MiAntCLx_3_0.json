However, it does not provide any information about the presence or absence of the flump shimble.\n\nTo infer \"The zazzle might be in the quibble and flump shimble,\" we would need additional information or context that suggests the presence of the flump shimble. Without such information, we cannot infer the presence of the flump shimble based solely on the statement \"The zazzle might be in the quibble.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
