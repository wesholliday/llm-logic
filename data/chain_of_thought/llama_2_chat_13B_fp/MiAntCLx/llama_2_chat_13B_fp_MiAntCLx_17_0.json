In other words, the sentence only implies that the blimp might be one of the things that are zooble, but it does not confirm that the blimp is both zooble and blurble by froodle.\n\nTherefore, based on the given sentence alone, we cannot infer 'The blimp might be zooble and be blurble by froodle'.\n\nAnswer: no",
