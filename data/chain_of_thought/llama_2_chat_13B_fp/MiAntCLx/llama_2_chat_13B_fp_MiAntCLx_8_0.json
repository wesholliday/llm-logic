Therefore, we can infer that 'floob' and 'zooble' are the objects of the preposition 'on', indicating that they are the things that the floob might be on.\n\nHowever, the phrase 'snork flimble wibble' does not appear to be related to the previous sentence. It is a nonsensical phrase that does not contribute to the meaning of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: no",
