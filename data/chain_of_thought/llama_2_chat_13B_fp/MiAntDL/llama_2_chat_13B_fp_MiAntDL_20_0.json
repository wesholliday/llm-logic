If we consider the possibility that the event might be formal, we can infer that it is more likely to be semi-formal rather than strictly formal. This is because semi-formal events are typically those that have some formal elements, such as a dress code or a structured program, but also allow for more casual elements, such as personalized speeches or interactive activities.\n\nAnswer: no",
