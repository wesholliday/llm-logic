However, it does mention 2 PM as one of the possible times.\n\nTo infer that the meeting might be at 2 PM, we need to consider the possibility that the meeting might not be cancelled. If the meeting is not cancelled, then it is likely to be held at 2 PM, as that is one of the possible times mentioned in the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the meeting might be at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
