However, it does not explicitly state that the keys are definitely in the drawer.\n\nTo infer that the keys might be in the drawer, we would need additional information or context that suggests the keys are more likely to be in the drawer than on the table. Without such information, we cannot infer that the keys are definitely in the drawer based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
