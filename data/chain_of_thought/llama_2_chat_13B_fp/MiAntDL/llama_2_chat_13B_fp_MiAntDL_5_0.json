However, it does not explicitly mention that the package will definitely be delivered today.\n\nTo infer that the package might be delivered today, we would need additional information or context that suggests that today is more likely than tomorrow. Without such information, we cannot infer that the package will definitely be delivered today based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
