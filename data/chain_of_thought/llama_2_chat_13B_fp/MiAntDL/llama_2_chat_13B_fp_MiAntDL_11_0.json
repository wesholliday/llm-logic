However, it does not explicitly state that the software will be updated.\n\nTo infer that the software might be updated, we need to consider the possibility of the software being updated or reinstalled. If the software is updated, it means that the current version of the software has been replaced with a newer version. Therefore, if the software might be updated or reinstalled, it is likely that the software will be updated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
