In other words, we need to focus on the first part of the statement, which suggests that the project might be completed by Friday, rather than the second part, which suggests that it might be extended.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The project might be completed by Friday\" based on the statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
