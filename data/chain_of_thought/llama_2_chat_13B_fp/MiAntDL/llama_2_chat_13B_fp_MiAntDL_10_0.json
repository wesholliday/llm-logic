Notarization is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing the signing of the document.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document is signed solely based on the fact that it might be notarized. However, we can infer that the document might be signed if it is notarized, as notarization typically involves signing the document.\n\nAnswer: no",
