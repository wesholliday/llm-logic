However, it does not directly imply that the flight will definitely be delayed.\n\nTo infer that the flight might be delayed, we need to consider the possibility that the flight might be delayed, which is indicated by the phrase \"or on time.\" This means that there is a chance that the flight might not be on time, and therefore, there is a possibility that it might be delayed.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
