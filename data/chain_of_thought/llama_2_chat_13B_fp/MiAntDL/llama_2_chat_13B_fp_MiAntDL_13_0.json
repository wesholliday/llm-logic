However, it does not directly imply that the movie is in English.\n\nTo infer that the movie might be in English, we need to consider the possibility that the movie could be in English and have subtitles. If the movie is in English, then the subtitles would be unnecessary, as the audience would already be able to understand the language. Therefore, if the movie is in English, it is more likely that the subtitles would not be present.\n\nAnswer: No.",
