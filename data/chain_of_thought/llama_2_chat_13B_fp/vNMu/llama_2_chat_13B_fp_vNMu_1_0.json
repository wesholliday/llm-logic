This means that there is no logical necessity that Mary was at the wedding. In other words, it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premise, stating that Mary might not have been at the wedding. This conclusion is true because, if it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, then it is possible that she was not there.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
