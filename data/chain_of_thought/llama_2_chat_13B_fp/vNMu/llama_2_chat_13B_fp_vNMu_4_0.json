The premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars,\" which can be represented as \"\u00ac(A \u2227 M),\" where \"A\" represents the proposition that the alien visited Mars and \"M\" represents the proposition that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The alien might not have visited Mars,\" which can be represented as \" maybe A \u00acM.\" To determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the logical form of the argument and see if it is valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
