            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the given information, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is certain that Mark bought the blue shirt. In other words, the two statements are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nThe second statement is \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This statement does not provide any information about Mark's purchase.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. The first statement only provides a conditional relationship between Lisa's purchase and Mark's purchase, and the second statement does not provide any information about Mark's purchase.\n\nAnswer: No",
