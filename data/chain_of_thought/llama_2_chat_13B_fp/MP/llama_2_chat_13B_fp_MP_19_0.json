            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'Jen watched basketball' from 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' together with 'Tom watched football', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, which means that the occurrence of one event (Tom watching football) implies the occurrence of another event (Jen watching basketball).\n\nThe second statement 'Tom watched football' is a premise, which provides evidence for the conditional statement.\n\nTo infer 'Jen watched basketball', we need to assume that Tom watched football and then use the conditional statement to deduce that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
