If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nThe second statement 'The griffin was in the forest' is a simple statement that asserts the existence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest, because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
