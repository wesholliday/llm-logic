Alex finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Chris finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nThis statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. This is because the \"if\" clause implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Alex finishing the race and Chris finishing the race.\n\nStatement 2: Alex finished the race.\nThis statement simply states that Alex did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If Alex finished the race, then we know that Chris finished the race, because of the cause-and-effect relationship established in Statement 1. Therefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
