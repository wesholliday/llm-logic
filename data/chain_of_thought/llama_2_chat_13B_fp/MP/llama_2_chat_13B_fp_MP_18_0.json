            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The truck was metal' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' together with 'The doll was plastic', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the conclusion (i.e., 'The truck was metal') depends on the truth of the premise (i.e., 'The doll was plastic').\n\nThe second statement 'The doll was plastic' is a fact, so we know that it is true.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the first statement is also true (i.e., 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true), we can deduce that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
