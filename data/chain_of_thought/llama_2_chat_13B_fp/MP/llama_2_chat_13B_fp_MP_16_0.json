In other words, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nThe second premise is \"The shirt was cotton.\" This premise provides the necessary antecedent to the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
