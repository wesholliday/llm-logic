This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nHowever, we are also given that Sue chose pizza, so we can directly infer that Bob chose pasta without needing to use the conditional statement. In other words, the fact that Sue chose pizza directly implies that Bob chose pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
