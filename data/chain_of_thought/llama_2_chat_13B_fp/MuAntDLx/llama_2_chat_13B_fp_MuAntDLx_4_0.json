The first independent clause is \"The quorple must be at grooble frazzle\" and the second independent clause is \"or snork\".\n\nBased on the sentence structure, we can see that the two independent clauses are connected by the word \"or\", which indicates that they are alternative possibilities. This means that if the quorple is not at grooble frazzle, then it must be at snork.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the quorple is not at grooble frazzle, then it must be at snork. However, we cannot infer the opposite, that the quorple must be at grooble frazzle, based on this sentence alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
