To infer that the zooble must be wozzle floob, we need to determine if the phrase \"in zump\" is essential to the statement or if it is just a parenthetical remark.\n\nIf we consider \"in zump\" to be a parenthetical remark, then the essential part of the statement is \"The zooble must be wozzle floob\", and we can infer that the zooble must be wozzle floob. However, if we consider \"in zump\" to be an essential part of the statement, then we cannot infer that the zooble must be wozzle floob without more information.\n\nAnswer: no",
