            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument has two premises:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\n2. The truck was metal\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called \"truth-functional logic.\" This involves evaluating the argument by considering the truth or falsity of each premise and the conclusion.\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true, and let's evaluate the conclusion. If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is a logical consequence of the premises, so the conclusion is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
