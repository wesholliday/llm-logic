            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement, where the \"if\" clause is \"the book was written by James\" and the \"then\" clause is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\" This is also a conditional statement, where the \"if\" clause is \"the book is a mystery novel\" and the \"then\" clause is \"the book was written by James.\"\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the premise provides sufficient reason to support the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The conclusion states that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. This is a logical consequence of the premise, as a mystery novel is a type of book that is typically written by James. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
