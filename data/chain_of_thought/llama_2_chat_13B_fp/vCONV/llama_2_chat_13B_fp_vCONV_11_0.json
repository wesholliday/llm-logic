            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument has two premises:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\n2. The muffins were blueberry\n\nAnd the conclusion is:\n\n3. If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called \"truth-table analysis.\" We can create a truth table with the following columns:\n\n| Cake | Muffins | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Chocolate | Blueberry | True |\n| Chocolate | Not Blueberry | False |\n| Not Chocolate | Blueberry | False |\n| Not Chocolate | Not Blueberry | True |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, regardless of the values assigned to the variables \"Cake\" and \"Muffins.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
