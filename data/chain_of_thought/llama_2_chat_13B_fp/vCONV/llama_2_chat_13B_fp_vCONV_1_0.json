            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion follows logically from the premise if the premise is true. The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This implies that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to determine whether it is necessarily true that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
