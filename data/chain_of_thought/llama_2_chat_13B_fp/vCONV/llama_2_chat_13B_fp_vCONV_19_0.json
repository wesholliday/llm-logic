            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a condition (Tom watching football) and its consequence (Jen watching basketball).\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" This is also a conditional statement, and it is the inverse of the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, the question is: does the argument follow the rules of logical reasoning? To answer this, we need to examine the truth table for the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe truth table for the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is as follows:\n\n| A | B | If A, then B |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | T |\n| F | F | F |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, if the premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true (A = T), then the conclusion \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" must also be true (B = T). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
