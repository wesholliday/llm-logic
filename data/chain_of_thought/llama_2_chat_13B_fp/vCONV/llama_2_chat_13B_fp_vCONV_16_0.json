            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a condition (the shirt being cotton) and its consequences (the pants being denim).\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" This is a reverse conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a condition (the pants being denim) and its consequences (the shirt being cotton).\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the premise provides sufficient reason to support the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise asserts that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. If we assume that the shirt was cotton (which is the premise), then it logically follows that the pants were denim (which is the conclusion).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it presents a logical and coherent relationship between the premise and the conclusion.",
