            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument we are considering has the following form:\n\nPremise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\nConclusion: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the premise of the argument. The premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) is dependent on the truth of the premise (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nNow, let's look at the conclusion of the argument. The conclusion states that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. This is also a conditional statement, and it is the opposite of the premise. In other words, if the premise is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), then the conclusion must be false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nSo, the argument is structured as a conditional statement with the premise and conclusion being opposites. This is a common form of argument known as a contrapositive argument.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if the conclusion is a necessary truth given the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
