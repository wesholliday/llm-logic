The premise of the argument is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. This statement implies that if the dog was inside the house, then the cat must be outside. The conclusion of the argument is 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside'. This statement logically follows from the premise, as if the cat was outside, then the dog must be inside.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
