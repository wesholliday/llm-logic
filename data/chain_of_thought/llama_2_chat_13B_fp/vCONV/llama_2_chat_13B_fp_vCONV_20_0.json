            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument has two premises:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nOur task is to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement, and it is true by definition.\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise is a statement of fact, and it is assumed to be true for the sake of argument.\n\n3. If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. To do this, we can use a technique called \"modus ponens,\" which allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have two premises, P and P \u2192 Q, then we can deduce the conclusion Q. In this case, our premises are:\n\nP1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nP2: The banana was yellow.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion:\n\nQ: If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
