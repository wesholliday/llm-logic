This implies a direct relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's attendance.\n\nTo infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\", we need to assume that if Mary did not attend the wedding, then Sue did not attend the wedding as well. This is a logical conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
