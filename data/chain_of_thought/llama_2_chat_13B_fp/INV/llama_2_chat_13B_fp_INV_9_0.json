However, the reverse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because Mark did not purchase the blue shirt, it does not mean that Lisa did not purchase the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
