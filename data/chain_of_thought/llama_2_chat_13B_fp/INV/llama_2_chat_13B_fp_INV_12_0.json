It does not imply that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. In other words, the statement only provides information about what happens if Joe goes to the park, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Joe does not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
