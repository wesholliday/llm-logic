This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the face.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This is because the statement only implies a direct relationship between Alex's finishing the race and Chris's finishing the face, and does not provide any information about Chris's finishing the race independently of Alex.\n\nAnswer: No",
