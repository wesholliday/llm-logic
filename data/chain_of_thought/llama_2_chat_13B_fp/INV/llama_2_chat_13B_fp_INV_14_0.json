            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the bear was in the cave' and the conclusion is 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we need to negate the condition. So, the negated condition would be 'the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nIf we substitute the negated condition into the original statement, we get:\n\n'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
