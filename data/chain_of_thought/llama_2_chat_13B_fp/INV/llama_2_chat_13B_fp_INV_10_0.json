            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', we need to carefully examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' implies that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. This is because the statement is talking about two different locations - inside and outside - and the dog and cat are being related to these locations.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside'. This statement is saying that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside. This statement is logically equivalent to the first statement, but with the opposite premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' because the two statements are logically equivalent, and the second statement is simply the opposite of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
