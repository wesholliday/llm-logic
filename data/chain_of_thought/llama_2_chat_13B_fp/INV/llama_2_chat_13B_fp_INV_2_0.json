            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest. In other words, if the griffin is in the forest, it is certain that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nNow, if we negate the first statement, we get 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'. This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the negation of the griffin's presence.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest' based on the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
