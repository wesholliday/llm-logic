This means that if Sue selected pizza, Bob selected pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario: if Sue did not choose pizza. In this case, Bob did not choose pasta. This is because the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies that if Sue selected pizza, Bob would select pasta. If Sue did not select pizza, then Bob would not select pasta.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
