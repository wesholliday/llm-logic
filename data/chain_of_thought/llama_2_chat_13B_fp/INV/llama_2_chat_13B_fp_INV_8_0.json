This is because the statement is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"if the vampire is awake.\" If the condition is not met (i.e., the vampire is not awake), then the conclusion does not follow.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This is because if the vampire is not awake, then the condition of the statement is not met, and the conclusion does not follow.\n\nAnswer: no",
