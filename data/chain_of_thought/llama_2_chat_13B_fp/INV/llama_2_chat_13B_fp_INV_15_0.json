This implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, it does not logically follow that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nThere could be other reasons why Erin did not take a train, such as if she took a different mode of transportation or if she did not travel at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
