            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the antecedent is 'the shirt was cotton' and the consequent is 'the pants were denim'.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to negate the antecedent, which means we need to assume that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nIf we assume that the shirt was not cotton, then the consequent of the original statement, 'the pants were denim', does not hold true. This is because the antecedent and consequent of the original statement are connected by a logical 'then', which implies a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the shirt was not cotton, we can infer that the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
