In this case, the statement implies that the robot also visited Jupiter. Therefore, if the alien visited Mars, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's assume that the alien did not visit Mars. In this case, the statement does not imply anything about the robot's visit to Jupiter. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, we cannot infer whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
