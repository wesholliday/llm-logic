            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball', we need to evaluate the given statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and determine if the negation of the first part of the statement implies the negation of the second part.\n\nLet's break down the statement:\n\n'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'\n\nThis statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, if we negate the first part of the statement, we get:\n\n'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball'\n\nThis negated statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because Tom did not watch football, it does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
