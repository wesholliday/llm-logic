            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition is 'If the book was written by James'. If the condition is true, then the conclusion follows, which is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nNow, to infer the new statement 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', we need to negate the condition. Negating the condition means reversing the truth value of the condition. Since the condition is 'If the book was written by James', negating it means 'If the book was not written by James'.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
