To infer the conclusion, we need to assume that the antecedent is false, i.e., the apple was not red.\n\nIf the apple was not red, then the consequent of the given statement, i.e., 'the banana was yellow', cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
