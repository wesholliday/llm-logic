This means that if the flugel is not blimmed, it cannot be zargled.\n\nSecondly, 'The flugel might not be zargled' implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled, even if it is blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the combination of these two statements. If the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled (based on the first statement). However, we know that the flugel might not be zargled (based on the second statement). This means that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled, even if it is not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel is blimmed' from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
