There is no middle ground.\n2. \"The fleeg might not be surned\" - This statement suggests that the fleeg might not be surned, but it does not rule out the possibility that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nNow, let's consider the combination of these two statements. We know that the fleeg is either bluttered or it must be surned, and we also know that it might not be surned. Can we infer that the fleeg is bluttered based on these two statements?\n\nAnswer: no",
