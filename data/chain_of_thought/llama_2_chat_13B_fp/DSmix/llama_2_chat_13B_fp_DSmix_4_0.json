If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled, because the first statement tells us that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked. However, the second statement does not rule out the possibility that the fribble is not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
