To infer that the artwork is worth millions, we would need additional information or context.\n\nFor example, if we know that the artwork is a rare and highly sought-after piece by a famous artist, or if we have evidence that it has been appraised for a high value in the past, then we might infer that it is worth millions. However, without this additional information, we cannot make a definitive statement about the value of the artwork.\n\nAnswer: no",
