However, we can infer that the performance might feature guest artists based on the presence of the word \"feature\" in the sentence.\n\nThe word \"feature\" implies that the performance will include specific elements or artists that are not part of the regular lineup. Since the sentence mentions \"guest artists,\" we can infer that the performance might feature these artists as part of the performance.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
