However, the phrase \"and require exotic ingredients\" does suggest that the recipe may call for ingredients that are not commonly found in everyday grocery stores.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the recipe might require exotic ingredients, but we cannot be certain without more information about the specific ingredients listed in the recipe.\n\nAnswer: yes",
