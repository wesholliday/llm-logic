This suggests that the contract may contain provisions that are not immediately apparent or obvious, which could be considered \"hidden clauses.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the contract might have hidden clauses, as the possibility of legally binding provisions being present suggests that there may be more to the contract than initially meets the eye.\n\nAnswer: yes",
