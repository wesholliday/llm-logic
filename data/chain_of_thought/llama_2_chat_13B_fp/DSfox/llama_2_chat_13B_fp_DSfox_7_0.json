This means that the whiffle is either not tinked or it is shanked.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked' reinforces the idea that the whiffle is either in a state of being tinked or it is shanked.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked. This is because the first statement implies that the whiffle is not tinked, and the second statement tells us that the whiffle is either tinked or shanked. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
