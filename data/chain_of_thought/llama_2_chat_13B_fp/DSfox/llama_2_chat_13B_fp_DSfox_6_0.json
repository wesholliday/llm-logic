The second statement 'Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed' indicates that the grommet is either in the plopped state or in the sploffed state.\n\nSince we know that the grommet is not in the plopped state, we can conclude that it must be in the sploffed state. Therefore, we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
