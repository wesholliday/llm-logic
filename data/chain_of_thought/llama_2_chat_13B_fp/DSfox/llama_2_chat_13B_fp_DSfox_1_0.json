This means that the flugel is either not zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed' confirms that the flugel is either in a state of being zargled or it is blimmed. This statement reinforces the idea that the flugel cannot be in a state of not being zargled or blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
