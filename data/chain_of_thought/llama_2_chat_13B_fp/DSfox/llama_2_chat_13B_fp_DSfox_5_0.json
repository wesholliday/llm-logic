To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if they provide enough information to make an inference.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1: \"The zinger is not smoogled.\" This statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled, but it does not provide any information about whether the zinger is fraggled.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.\" This statement tells us that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled. In other words, if the zinger is not smoogled, then it is fraggled.\n\nSo, putting these two statements together, we can infer that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it is fraggled. This means that we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
