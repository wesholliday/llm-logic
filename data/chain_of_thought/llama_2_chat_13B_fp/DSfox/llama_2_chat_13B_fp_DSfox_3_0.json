The second statement 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed' states that the splat is either in a quanked state or it is in a morphed state.\n\nSince we know that the splat is not in a quanked state (according to the first statement), we can conclude that the splat must be in a morphed state. Therefore, we can infer 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
