The second statement 'Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled' implies that the flob is either in a state of motion (movated) or it is skizzled (i.e., not in a state of motion).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, as there is no other possibility according to the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
