However, it does not directly imply that the project might be completed both early and late.\n\nTo infer that the project might be completed early and late, we need to consider the possibility of the project being completed early and the possibility of it being completed late separately.\n\nIf we assume that the project might be completed early, then it is also possible that it might be completed late, as these two outcomes are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project might be completed early and late based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
