This implies that there is a range of outcomes, with one end being passing and the other end being failing.\n\nSince we know that the student might pass or fail, we can infer that there is a possibility of the student passing and a possibility of the student failing. This means that we can infer both \"The student might pass the exam\" and \"The student might fail the exam\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
