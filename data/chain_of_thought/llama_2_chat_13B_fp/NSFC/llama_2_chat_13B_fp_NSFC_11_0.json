However, it does not explicitly state that the train might be both early and late.\n\nTo infer that the train might be early and late, we would need additional information or context that suggests the train could potentially arrive at two different times. Without such information, it is not possible to infer that the train might be both early and late based solely on the statement \"The train might be early or late.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
