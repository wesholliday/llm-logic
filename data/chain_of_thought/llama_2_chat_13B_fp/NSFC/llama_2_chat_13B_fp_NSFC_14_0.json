This phrase suggests that both options are possible, and it does not imply that one option is more likely than the other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the company might expand and the company might downsize. These two statements are not equivalent, as the first phrase only mentions two possible scenarios, while the second phrase suggests that both scenarios are equally likely.\n\nAnswer: No",
