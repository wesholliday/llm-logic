The second statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' establishes a causal relationship between being shanked and tinkling.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, it is reasonable to infer that the whiffle tinked, as the causal relationship between being shanked and tinkling suggests that if the whiffle was shanked, it is likely to have tinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
