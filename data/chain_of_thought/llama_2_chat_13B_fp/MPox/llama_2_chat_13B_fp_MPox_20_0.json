This statement tells us that the fleeg was in a certain state (bluttered).\n\nNext, we have 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'. This statement tells us that if the fleeg was in the state of bluttered, then it must have undergone a certain process (surned).\n\nNow, we want to infer 'The fleeg surned' from these two statements. To do this, we need to determine if there is a logical connection between the state of bluttered and the process of surned.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we can see that there is a logical connection between these two statements. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have undergone the process of surned. Therefore, we can infer 'The fleeg surned' from 'The fleeg was bluttered' together with 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
