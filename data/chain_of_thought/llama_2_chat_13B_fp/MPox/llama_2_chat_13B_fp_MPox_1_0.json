The second statement 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' presents a conditional relationship between the state of the flugel and the state of zargling.\n\nTo infer 'The flugel was zargled', we need to assume that the flugel was indeed blimmed, and then apply the conditional statement to conclude that the flugel was zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
