To infer 'The grommet plopped the frink', we need to determine if the conditional statement is valid and if the premise is true.\n\nFirst, we need to evaluate the conditional statement. The if-clause 'If the grommet was sploffed' is a hypothesis, and the then-clause 'the grommet plopped the frink' is the conclusion. To make the inference, we need to ensure that the hypothesis (if-clause) is true given the premise (the grommet was sploffed).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the premise 'The grommet was sploffed'. This statement is a simple statement that describes the state of the grommet. It does not provide any information about the grommet plopping the frink. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet plopped the frink' based solely on the premise 'The grommet was sploffed'.\n\nHowever, when we combine the premise with the conditional statement, we can make an inference. The conditional statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. Since the premise states that the grommet was sploffed, we can infer that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
