            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding. To do this, we need to determine if the two statements are logically equivalent. In other words, we need to determine if the statement \"Mary was at the wedding\" can be deduced from the two given statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding. It does not directly state that Mary attended the wedding.\n\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement directly states that Sue attended the wedding.\n\nExplanation:\n\nNow, let's consider the logical equivalence of the two statements. We know that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding (from statement 1). Moreover, we know that Sue did attend the wedding (from statement 2). Therefore, we can deduce that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding, and since Sue did attend the wedding, we can conclude that Mary attended the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
