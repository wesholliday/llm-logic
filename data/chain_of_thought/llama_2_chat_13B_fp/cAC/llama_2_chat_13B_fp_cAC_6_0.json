If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n2. Bob chose pasta\n\nWe can start by assuming that Bob chose pasta, and then examine the implications for Sue's choice.\n\nIf Bob chose pasta, then the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" becomes true. This means that if Sue had chosen pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nHowever, we are also given that Bob chose pasta, so we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, Bob would not have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No",
