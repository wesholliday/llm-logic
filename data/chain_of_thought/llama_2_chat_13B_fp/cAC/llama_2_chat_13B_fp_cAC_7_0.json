Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can conclude that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race. This statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can conclude based on these two statements. If we assume that Alex finished the race, then we know that Chris finished the race, because of statement 1. But, we don't necessarily know that Alex finished the race, because we only know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
