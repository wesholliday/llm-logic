This means that the dreb might have been in a state where it was not necessary to spend any money on it.\n\nThe second statement 'If the dreb was vroomed, then the dreb must have been spened' implies that if the dreb was vroomed, then it must have been spened, which means that the dreb was in a state where it required spending money on it.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these two statements. If the dreb was not vroomed, then it must not have been necessary to spend any money on it, which is in line with the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroomed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
