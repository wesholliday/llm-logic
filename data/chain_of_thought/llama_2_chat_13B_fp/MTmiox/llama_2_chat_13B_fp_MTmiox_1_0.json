If we combine the two statements, we can infer that if the flugel was not zargled, then it must not have been blimmed, because if it was blimmed, it would have been zargled. In other words, the absence of zargling implies the absence of blimming.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
