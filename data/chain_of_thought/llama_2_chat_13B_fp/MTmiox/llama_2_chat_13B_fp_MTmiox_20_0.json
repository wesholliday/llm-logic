In other words, the absence of surning does not necessarily imply the absence of bluttering.\n\nSecondly, 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned' implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it is certain that the fleeg was surned. However, this statement does not provide any information about the absence of bluttering.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' with certainty. The absence of surning does not necessarily imply the absence of bluttering, and the presence of bluttering does not necessarily imply the absence of surning. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the fleeg's bluttering status based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
