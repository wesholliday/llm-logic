However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the splat was actually morphed or not.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If we assume that the splat was morphed, then the second statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" would be true. However, if we assume that the splat was not morphed, then the first statement \"The splat might not have quanked\" would be true, and we cannot infer whether the splat was morphed or not based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the splat was not morphed based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
