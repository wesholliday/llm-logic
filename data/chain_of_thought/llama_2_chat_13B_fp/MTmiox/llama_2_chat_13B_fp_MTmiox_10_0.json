This means that the wug might have been in a state other than garpled.\n\nThe second statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled' implies that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been in a state of garpledness. This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it cannot be in any other state other than garpled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the wug was not garpled, then it cannot be sproinged, because if it was sproinged, it must have been garpled. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
