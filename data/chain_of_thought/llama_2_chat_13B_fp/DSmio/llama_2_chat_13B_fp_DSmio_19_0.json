Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist, which means it could be anywhere else.\n\nStatement 2 states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. If the watch is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser. But we already know that the watch might not be on his wrist, so we can't conclude that it is charging on the dresser based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
