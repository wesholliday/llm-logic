Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cat is napping on the couch. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the cat being in the bedroom.\n\nIf the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch. Therefore, the first statement implies that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the cat is playing in the bedroom, then it cannot be napping on the couch. Therefore, the second statement contradicts the possibility of the cat being napping on the couch.\n\nConclusion:\n\nExplanation: Based on the given statements, it is more likely that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
