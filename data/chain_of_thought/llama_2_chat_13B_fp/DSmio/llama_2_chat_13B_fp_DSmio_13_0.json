Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the toy is in the toy box based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, which means it could be anywhere else, including the toy box.\n\nStatement 2 states that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nIf the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box (Statement 2).\n\nSince the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf (Statement 1), we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
