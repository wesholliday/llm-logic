Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the jacket is draped over the chair. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the jacket being hanging in the closet.\n\nIf the jacket is hanging in the closet, then it cannot be draped over the chair. Therefore, if the jacket is hanging in the closet, we cannot infer that it is draped over the chair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair or somewhere else. In this case, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
