Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the scarf being draped on the coat rack.\n\nIf the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack, since the only other option is that it is draped on the coat rack. Therefore, if the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
