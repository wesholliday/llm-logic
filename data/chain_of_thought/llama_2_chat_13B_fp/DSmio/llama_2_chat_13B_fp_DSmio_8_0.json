Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the remote control is on the coffee table. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the remote control being under the couch.\n\nIf the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table. This is because the second statement tells us that if the remote control is not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
