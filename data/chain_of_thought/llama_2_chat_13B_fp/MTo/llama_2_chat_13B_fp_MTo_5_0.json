            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from 'Amy did not play tennis' together with 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe given statements can be represented as two conditional statements:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Amy did not play tennis.\n\nWe can combine these two statements using logical negation (~) to get:\n\n~(Jeff played basketball) \u2227 ~Amy played tennis\n\nNow, we can use De Morgan's laws to simplify the expression:\n\n~(Jeff played basketball) \u2227 ~Amy played tennis \u27f9 ~(Jeff played basketball \u2228 Amy played tennis)\n\nSince we know that Amy did not play tennis, we can deduce that the right-hand side of the implication is false. Therefore, the left-hand side must be true, which means that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
