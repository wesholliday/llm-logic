If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: The truck was not metal.\n\nThis statement tells us that the truck was not made of metal.\n\nStatement 2: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThis statement tells us that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck would be made of metal.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the truck was not metal, then it must be made of another material, such as plastic or wood. However, if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
