The unicorn was not in the forest (given)\n2. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (given)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce that:\n\n1. If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest (logical deduction)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
