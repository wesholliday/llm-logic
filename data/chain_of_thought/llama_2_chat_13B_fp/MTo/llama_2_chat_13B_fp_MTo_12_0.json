This statement is a negative statement about Lucy's actions.\n\nSecond, we have the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, since we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
