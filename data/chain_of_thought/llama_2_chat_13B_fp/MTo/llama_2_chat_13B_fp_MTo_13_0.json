If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the car was not red based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the truck was not blue. This means that the truck could have been any color other than blue.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue, but it is not blue.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The car is red.\n\nIn this scenario, the truck would be blue, but it is not blue, so this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The car is not red.\n\nIn this scenario, the truck could be any color other than blue, so this scenario is possible.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that the car was not red. The statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
