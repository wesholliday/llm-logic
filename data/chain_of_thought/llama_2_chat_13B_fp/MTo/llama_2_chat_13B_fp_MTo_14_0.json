If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the bear was not in the cave. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The bear was not in the cave\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. The wolf was not in the den.\n\nThis statement simply tells us that the wolf was not present in the den. It does not provide any information about the bear.\n\n2. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nThis statement implies that if the bear was present in the cave, then the wolf would also be present in the den.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of the bear and the wolf:\n\n1. Both the bear and the wolf were not in the den.\n2. The bear was in the cave, and the wolf was in the den.\n\nIn the first combination, the bear and the wolf were not in the den, so the statement \"The bear was not in the cave\" is true.\n\nIn the second combination, the bear was in the cave, and the wolf was in the den, so the statement \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer whether the bear was not in the cave or not. The statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
