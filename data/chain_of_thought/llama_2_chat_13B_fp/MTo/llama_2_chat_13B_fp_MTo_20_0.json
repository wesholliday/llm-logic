            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The apple was not red' from 'The banana was not yellow' together with 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe first statement 'The banana was not yellow' tells us that the banana did not have the property of being yellow. The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' implies that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana would have had the property of being yellow.\n\nNow, let's assume that the apple was red. If the apple was red, then according to the second statement, the banana would have been yellow. However, we know that the banana was not yellow, so this assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
