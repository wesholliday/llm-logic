If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" given the information that the pants were not denim.\n\nLet's assume that the shirt was cotton. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim, but we know that the pants were not denim. This means that the assumption that the shirt was cotton must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
