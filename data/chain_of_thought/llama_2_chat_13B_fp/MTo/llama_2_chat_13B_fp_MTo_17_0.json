The second statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have eaten the salad.\n\nTo infer 'Ben did not eat pasta', we need to assume that Ben did eat pasta and then evaluate the truth of the statement 'Kate ate the salad'. If Kate did not eat the salad, then it is not possible for her to have eaten the pasta, and therefore Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
