If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book was not written by James. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the book was written by James. Then, based on statement 2, we know that the book is a mystery novel. However, based on statement 1, we know that the book is not a mystery novel. This creates a logical contradiction, as we have two statements that cannot both be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
