If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThis statement simply tells us that Sue did not attend the wedding. It does not provide any information about Mary's attendance.\n\nStatement 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If we combine the two statements, we can deduce that:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nBut we know that Sue was not at the wedding (from statement 1). Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nSo, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
