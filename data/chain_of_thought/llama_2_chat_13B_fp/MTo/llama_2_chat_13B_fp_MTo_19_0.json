If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Jen did not watch basketball. This information is not related to Tom's activity.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.
