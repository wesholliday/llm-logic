The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the keys are in the drawer based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the keys could be either dangling in the cabinet or in the drawer. This means that the keys could be in either location.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys cannot be in the cabinet.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible locations of the keys:\n\n1. If the keys are not in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
