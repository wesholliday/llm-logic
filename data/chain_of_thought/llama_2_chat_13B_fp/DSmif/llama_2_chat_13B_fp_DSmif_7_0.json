The umbrella is tucked away in the closet: In this case, the statement 'Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car' is false, since the umbrella is not in the car. Therefore, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n2. The umbrella is not tucked away in the closet: In this case, the statement 'Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car' is true, since the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
