The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the notebook is in the drawer. To do this, we need to evaluate the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand and compare it to the possibility of it being in the drawer.\n\nLet's consider the first statement:\n\n1. Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nThis statement implies that the notebook cannot be in both places at once. If it is on the nightstand, then it cannot be in the drawer. Therefore, if the notebook is not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. If the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer, based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
