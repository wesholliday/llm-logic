The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the cat is napping on the couch based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the cat must be either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch. This means that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Therefore, based on Statement 1, we can infer that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
