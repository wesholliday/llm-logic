The second statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' suggests that Fido might not be in the garden, but it does not rule out the possibility that Fido might be inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based on these two statements alone. The information provided does not provide sufficient evidence to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
