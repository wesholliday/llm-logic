Therefore, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nOn the other hand, if the newspaper is not in the driveway, then it must be sitting on the porch, because the statement 'The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch' is false. In this case, we cannot infer that the newspaper is in the driveway, because it is not.\n\nAnswer: no",
