The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nWe can start by considering the first statement. If the milk is on the counter, then it cannot be chilling in the fridge, so the second statement is false. Therefore, if the milk is on the counter, we can infer that it is not chilling in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, then it might be on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
