The vampire was not awake.\n\nWe can start by evaluating the first statement. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake, according to the first statement. However, we are also given that the vampire was not awake, so we cannot conclude that the mummy was awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the vampire was not awake, then we cannot infer that the mummy was awake. The lack of awareness of the vampire does not necessarily imply the awareness of the mummy.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based on the given statements. The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusion about the awareness of the mummy.\n\nAnswer: no",
