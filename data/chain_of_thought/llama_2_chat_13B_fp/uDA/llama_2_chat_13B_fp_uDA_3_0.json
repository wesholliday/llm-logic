The book was not written by James.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be any other type of novel (e.g., romance, sci-fi, etc.).\n\n2. The book was not written by James.\n\nThis statement tells us that the book was not written by James. This means that the book does not meet the condition specified in statement 1, which states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements together. Since the book was not written by James, it does not meet the condition specified in statement 1. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
