The car was not red.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nThis statement implies that if the car had been red, then the truck would have been blue. However, since the car was not red, it is not possible for the truck to be blue based on this statement.\n\n2. The car was not red.\n\nThis statement simply states that the car was not red. It does not provide any information about the truck.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If the car was not red, then it is not possible for the truck to be blue based on the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
