The dog was not inside.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nThis statement implies that if the dog was inside, the cat would be outside. It does not say that the cat is always outside, only that if the dog is inside, the cat is outside.\n\nStatement 2: The dog was not inside.\n\nThis statement tells us that the dog is not inside. It does not provide any information about the cat.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If the dog is not inside, then we can infer that the cat is not inside either, based on statement 1. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cat is outside. The cat could be anywhere else, such as in another room or outside.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside based solely on the given statements. We need more information to determine the location of the cat.\n\nAnswer: No",
