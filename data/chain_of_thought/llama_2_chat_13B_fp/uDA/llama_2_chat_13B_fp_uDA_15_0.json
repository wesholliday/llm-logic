Sam did not take a plane.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nThis statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, since Sam did not take a plane, we cannot infer that Erin took a train.\n\n2. Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThis statement tells us that Sam did not take a plane, but it does not provide any information about Erin's mode of transportation.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, since Sam did not take a plane, we cannot infer that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: No",
