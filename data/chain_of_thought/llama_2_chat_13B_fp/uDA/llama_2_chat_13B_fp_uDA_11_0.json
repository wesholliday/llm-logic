The cake was not chocolate.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. However, since the cake was not chocolate, we cannot infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nStatement 2: The cake was not chocolate.\n\nThis statement tells us that the cake was not made of chocolate. Since we already know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry, we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
