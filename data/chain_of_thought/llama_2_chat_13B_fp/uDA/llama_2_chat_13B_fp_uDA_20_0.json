The apple was not red.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow. However, since the apple was not red, we cannot infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nStatement 2: The apple was not red.\n\nThis statement tells us that the apple was not red, but it does not provide any information about the banana.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, the apple was not red, so we cannot infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No",
