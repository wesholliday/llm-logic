The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter based on these two statements.\n\nLet's assume that the alien visited Mars. In this case, the first statement tells us that the robot visited Jupiter. However, the second statement tells us that the alien did not visit Mars, which means that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's assume that the alien did not visit Mars. In this case, the first statement is false, and we cannot infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
