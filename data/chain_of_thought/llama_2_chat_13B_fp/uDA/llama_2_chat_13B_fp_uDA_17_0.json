Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nThis statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. However, since Ben did not eat pasta, we cannot infer that Kate ate salad.\n\n2. Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nThis statement tells us that Ben did not eat pasta, which means that the first statement's condition (Ben eating pasta) did not occur. Therefore, we cannot infer that Kate ate salad based on the first statement.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat salad. The first statement only implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but since Ben did not eat pasta, we cannot make any inference about Kate's salad consumption.\n\nAnswer: no",
