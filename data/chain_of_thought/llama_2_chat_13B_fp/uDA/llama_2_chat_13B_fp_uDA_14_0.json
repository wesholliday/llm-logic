The bear was not in the cave.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the wolf was not in the den based on these statements.\n\nLet's assume that the bear was in the cave. If the bear was in the cave, then according to statement 1, the wolf would also be in the den. However, since the bear was not in the cave, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nNow, let's assume that the bear was not in the cave. In this case, statement 1 does not apply, and we cannot infer anything about the wolf's presence in the den.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
