Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Amy did not play tennis based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThis statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, since Jeff did not play basketball, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis based on this statement alone.\n\nStatement 2: Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThis statement tells us that Jeff did not play basketball, but it does not provide any information about Amy's participation in tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the combination of both statements:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
