Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding based on these statements.\n\nLet's assume that Mary was at the wedding (this is not the case, but just for the sake of the argument). If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, according to statement 1.\n\nHowever, we are also given that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that Sue was not at the wedding, since Mary was not there.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding, based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
