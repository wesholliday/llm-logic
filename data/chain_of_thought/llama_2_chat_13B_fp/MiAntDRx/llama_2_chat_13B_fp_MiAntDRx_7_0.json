However, it does not explicitly state that the flim is definitely zooble.\n\nTo infer that the flim might be zooble, we would need additional information or context that suggests the flim is more likely to be zooble than plonk. Without such information, we cannot infer that the flim is definitely zooble based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
