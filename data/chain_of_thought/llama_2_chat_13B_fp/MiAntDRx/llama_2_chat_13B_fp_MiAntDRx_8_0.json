The flibbit might be zump on frazzle.\n2. The flibbit might be zooble for frozz wibble.\n3. The flibbit might be zump on frazzle or zooble for frozz wibble.\n\nWe can eliminate possibility 1 since it is not relevant to the inference we want to draw. Therefore, we are left with two possibilities:\n\n1. The flibbit might be zooble for frozz wibble.\n2. The flibbit might be zump on frazzle or zooble for frozz wibble.\n\nTo infer 'The flibbit might be zooble for frozz wibble', we need to focus on possibility 1, which states that the flibbit might be zooble for frozz wibble. This possibility is not negated by any of the other two possibilities, so we can infer that the flibbit might be zooble for frozz wibble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
