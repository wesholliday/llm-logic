            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each premise and the conclusion separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothetical situation is that the doll is plastic, and the consequence is that the truck is metal.\n\nThe second premise is 'The truck was metal'. This premise is a straightforward statement of fact, and it is not conditional or hypothetical.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument, which is 'The doll was plastic'. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, because if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, and we know from the second premise that the truck was metal. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
