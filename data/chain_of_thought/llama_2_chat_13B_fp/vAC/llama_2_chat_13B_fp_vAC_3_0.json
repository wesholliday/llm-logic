            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe first premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) under a specific condition (the book was written by James).\n\nThe second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. This premise is a simple statement that asserts the truth of the book being a mystery novel, without any conditions.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the book was written by James. This conclusion is derived from the first premise and the second premise.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, let's assume that the premises are true. If the book is a mystery novel (second premise), and if the book was written by James (first premise), then it follows that the book was written by James (conclusion). This is because the first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, and the second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
