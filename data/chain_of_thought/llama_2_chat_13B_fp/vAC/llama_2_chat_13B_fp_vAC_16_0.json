            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each premise and the conclusion separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a certain condition (the shirt being cotton) and its consequences (the pants being denim). The condition is in the antecedent (the shirt being cotton), and the consequence is in the consequent (the pants being denim).\n\nThe second premise is 'The pants were denim'. This premise is a simple statement of fact, and it does not contain any conditionals or hypothetical situations.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: 'The shirt was cotton'. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim (by the first premise), and we know that the pants were denim (by the second premise). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid, because its conclusion logically follows from its premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
