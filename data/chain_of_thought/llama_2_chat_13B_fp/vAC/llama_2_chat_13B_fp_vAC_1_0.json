            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so we can use a truth table to evaluate its validity.\n\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\nPremise 2: Sue was at the wedding\nConclusion: Mary was at the wedding\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true, and let's consider the possible combinations of truth values for the premises:\n\n1. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: True\n2. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: True\n3. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: False\n4. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: False\n\nNow, let's examine each combination and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: True\n\nIf both premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows. If Mary was at the wedding (Premise 1), then Sue was at the wedding (Premise 2), and therefore Mary was at the wedding (Conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\n2. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: True\n\nIf Premise 1 is false, then the conclusion cannot logically follow. Even if Sue was at the wedding (Premise 2), it does not guarantee that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No\n\n3. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: False\n\nIf Premise 2 is false, then the conclusion cannot logically follow. Even if Mary was at the wedding (Premise 1), it does not guarantee that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No\n\n4. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: False\n\nIf both premises are false, then the conclusion cannot logically follow. Even if Mary and Sue were not at the wedding, it does not mean that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises in all possible combinations.",
