            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so let's consider each part separately.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This premise is in the form of a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of the conclusion (the banana was yellow) under the condition that the antecedent (the apple was red) is true.\n\nThe second premise is 'The banana was yellow'. This premise is a simple statement of fact, and it does not contain any conditionals or hypotheticals.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: 'The apple was red'. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, because if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (by the first premise), and the banana was yellow (by the second premise).\n\nSo, the argument has two premises and a conclusion, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But is the argument logically valid? To determine this, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, regardless of whether the premises are true or false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
