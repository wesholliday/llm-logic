            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises and a conclusion, so we can use a truth table to evaluate its validity.\n\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\nPremise 2: The wolf was in the den\nConclusion: The bear was in the cave\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true, and let's consider the possible combinations of truth values for the premises:\n\n1. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: True\n2. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: True\n3. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: False\n4. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: False\n\nNow, let's examine each combination of truth values and see if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n1. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: True\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Premise 1), and the wolf was in the den (Premise 2). Therefore, the bear was in the cave (Conclusion). Yes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n2. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: True\n\nIf the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den (Premise 1), but the wolf was in the den (Premise 2). This is a contradiction, as the wolf was not in the den if the bear was not in the cave. No, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n3. Premise 1: True, Premise 2: False\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Premise 1), but the wolf was not in the den (Premise 2). This is a contradiction, as the wolf was not in the den if the bear was in the cave. No, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n4. Premise 1: False, Premise 2: False\n\nIf the bear was not in the cave, and the wolf was not in the den, then the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. No, the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No",
