If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be either bluttered or neither (i.e., neither bluttered nor surned).\n\nSecond, we know that 'The fleeg is not surned' means that the fleeg is neither surned nor bluttered. Therefore, if the fleeg is not surned, it cannot be bluttered.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSince we know that the fleeg is not surned and cannot be bluttered, we can infer that the fleeg is neither bluttered nor surned. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
