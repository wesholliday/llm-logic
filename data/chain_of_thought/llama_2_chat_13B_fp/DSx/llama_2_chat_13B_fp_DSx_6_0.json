We need to determine if we can infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" - This statement means that the grommet is either sploffed or plopped, but it cannot be both.\n2. \"The grommet is not plopped\" - This statement means that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The grommet is sploffed.\n\nIn this scenario, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false.\n\nScenario 2: The grommet is plopped.\n\nIn this scenario, the first statement is false, and the second statement is true.\n\nSince we know that the grommet is not plopped, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
