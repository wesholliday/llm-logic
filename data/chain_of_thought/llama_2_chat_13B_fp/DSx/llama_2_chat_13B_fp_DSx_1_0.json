If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed. Therefore, we can deduce that 'The flugel is blimmed' is a logical consequence of the first statement.\n\nHowever, we are also given 'The flugel is not zargled', which implies that the flugel is not in a zargled state. This statement does not provide any information about the blimmed state of the flugel. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel is blimmed' solely based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
