            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements: \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" and \"The splat is not quanked.\" We need to determine if we can infer \"The splat is morphed\" based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" - This statement means that the splat is either morphed or quanked, but it cannot be both.\n2. \"The splat is not quanked\" - This statement means that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the splat is morphed, then it cannot be quanked, because quanked and morphed are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the splat is morphed, we can infer that it is not quanked.\n\nOn the other hand, if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked, because there is no other possibility.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
