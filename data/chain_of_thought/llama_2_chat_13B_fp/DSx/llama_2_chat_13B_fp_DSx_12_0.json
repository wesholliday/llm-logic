The smip is not lupped.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smip is shripped based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\n\nThis statement means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nStatement 2: The smip is not lupped.\n\nThis statement tells us that the smip is not lupped, which means that it must be shripped.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\nIf the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped. (Statement 1)\nThe smip is not lupped. (Statement 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
