We need to determine if we can infer that the zinger is fraggled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the first statement: \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled\". This statement means that one of the two possibilities, either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled, must be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The zinger is not smoogled\". This statement means that the zinger is not in a state of being smoogled.\n\nIf the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled, because the only two possibilities are either fraggled or smoogled, and we have already ruled out smoogled. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled based on the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
