This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nSecondly, 'The fribble is not crinked' indicates that the fribble does not satisfy the condition of being crinked. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
