The clug is fleeked: If the clug is fleeked, then it cannot be snugged, as these two states are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the clug is not snugged, it must be fleeked.\n2. The clug is snugged: If the clug is snugged, then it cannot be fleeked, as these two states are also mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the clug is not fleeked, it must be snugged.\n\nSince we know that the clug is not snugged, we can conclude that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
