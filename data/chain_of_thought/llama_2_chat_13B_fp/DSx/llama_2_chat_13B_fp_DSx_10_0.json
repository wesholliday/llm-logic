The wug is sproinged: In this case, the first statement 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled' is true, since the wug is indeed sproinged.\n2. The wug is not garpled: In this case, the second statement 'The wug is not garpled' is true, since the wug is not garpled.\n\nIn both cases, the statements are true, so we can infer 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
