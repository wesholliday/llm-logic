The smonk is not plagged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the smonk is vreebled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the smonk is not plagged. Therefore, based on statement 1, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
