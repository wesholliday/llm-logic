The shank is not nugged.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the shank is plooked based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\n\nThis statement means that there are only two possible states of the shank: plooked or nugged. If the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nStatement 2: The shank is not nugged.\n\nThis statement tells us that the shank is not in the state of being nugged. Since we know that the shank is either plooked or nugged (from statement 1), we can conclude that the shank is not in the state of being nugged, which means it must be in the state of being plooked.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
