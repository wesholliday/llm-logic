'Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated'\n\nThis statement implies that the flob is either skizzled or movated, but not both.\n\n2. 'The flob is not movated'\n\nThis statement implies that the flob is not movated.\n\nNow, let's negate both statements:\n\n1. 'Not (Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated)'\n\nThis statement implies that the flob is not either skizzled or movated.\n\n2. 'Not (The flob is not movated)'\n\nThis statement implies that the flob is movated.\n\nNow, we can combine the negated statements using logical negation:\n\n'Not (Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated) and Not (The flob is not movated)'\n\nThis statement implies that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
