However, it does not explicitly state that the candidate might win and lose the election simultaneously.\n\nTo infer \"The candidate might win the election and they might lose the election,\" we need to assume that the candidate has a 50% chance of winning and losing the election, which is not explicitly stated in the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The candidate might win the election and they might lose the election\" solely based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
