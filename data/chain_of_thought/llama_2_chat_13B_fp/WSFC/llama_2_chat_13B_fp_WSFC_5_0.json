The statement says that Sarah might study biology or she might study chemistry. This means that there are two possibilities:\n\n1. Sarah might study biology.\n2. Sarah might study chemistry.\n\nWe cannot infer that Sarah will definitely study both biology and chemistry, as there is no information to support this. However, we can infer that Sarah might study one or the other, but we cannot determine which one she will choose.\n\nAnswer: no",
