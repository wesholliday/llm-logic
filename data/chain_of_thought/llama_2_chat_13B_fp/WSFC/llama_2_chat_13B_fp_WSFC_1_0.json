However, it does not necessarily mean that John will do only one of these activities.\n\nIf we assume that John has a choice between cleaning his room and going to the lecture, then it is possible that he might choose to do both. In other words, John might clean his room and then go to the lecture, or he might go to the lecture and then clean his room.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'John might clean his room and he might go to the lecture'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
