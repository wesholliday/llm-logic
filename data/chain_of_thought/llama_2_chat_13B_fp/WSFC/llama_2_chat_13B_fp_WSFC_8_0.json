However, the statement does not explicitly mention both possibilities together.\n\nTo infer \"The weather might be sunny and it might be rainy,\" we need to assume that both sunny and rainy conditions are possible, which is not explicitly stated in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer this statement based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
