However, it does not explicitly state that both early completion and late completion are possible.\n\nTo infer \"The project might be completed early and it might be late,\" we would need additional information or context that suggests both possibilities are equally likely. Without such information, we can only infer that one or the other possibility is more likely, but not both.\n\nAnswer: no",
