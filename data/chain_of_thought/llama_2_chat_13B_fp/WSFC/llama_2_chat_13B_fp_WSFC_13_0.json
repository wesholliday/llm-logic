However, it does not explicitly state that the restaurant will serve both Italian and Chinese cuisine.\n\nTo infer that the restaurant might serve both Italian and Chinese cuisine, we need to use logical reasoning. We know that the restaurant might serve Italian cuisine, and we know that it might serve Chinese cuisine. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might serve both Italian and Chinese cuisine.\n\nAnswer: yes",
