However, it does not explicitly state that both outcomes are equally likely or that both will occur.\n\nTo infer \"The stock price might go up and it might go down,\" we need to assume that both outcomes are equally likely, which may not be the case. Without additional information, we cannot infer that both outcomes are equally likely, and therefore, we cannot infer \"The stock price might go up and it might go down.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
