However, this statement does not explicitly mention both possibilities together.\n\nTo infer \"The company might expand and it might downsize,\" we need to assume that the company has the potential to do both, which is not explicitly stated in the original statement. This inference requires us to make an assumption about the company's future actions based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
