However, it does not explicitly state that both rock and jazz music will be featured.\n\nTo infer that the concert might feature both rock and jazz music, we need to use logical reasoning. We know that the concert might feature rock music, and we know that it might feature jazz music. Therefore, we can infer that the concert might feature both rock and jazz music.\n\nAnswer: yes",
