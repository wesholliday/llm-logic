However, it does not explicitly state that the flight might be both delayed and on time.\n\nTo infer that the flight might be delayed and it might be on time, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the flight is already running late, then it is more likely that it will be delayed, but it is still possible that it might be on time.\n\nAnswer: no",
