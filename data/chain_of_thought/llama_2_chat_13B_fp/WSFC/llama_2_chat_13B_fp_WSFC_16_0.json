To infer \"The student might pass the exam and they might fail the exam\" would require additional information or context.\n\nThe original statement only provides two mutually exclusive options, passing and failing, and does not suggest that both options are equally likely or that both options are possible. In the absence of any additional information, it is not possible to infer that both passing and failing are equally likely or that both options are possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
