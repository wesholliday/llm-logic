If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement simply tells us that Sue attended the wedding. It does not provide any information about Mary's attendance.\n\nStatement 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding. In other words, if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue would also be present.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If we combine both statements, we can conclude that:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that Sue was at the wedding, and if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n\nSo, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. However, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
