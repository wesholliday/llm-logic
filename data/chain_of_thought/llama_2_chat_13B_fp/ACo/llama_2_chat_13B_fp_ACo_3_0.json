            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. The book is a mystery novel.\n2. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the book was written by James based on these premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\nPremise 1 states that the book is a mystery novel. This tells us that the book belongs to the genre of mystery novels.\n\nPremise 2 states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This tells us that if James wrote the book, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these premises. If we combine the two premises, we can infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. This is because if the book is a mystery novel, then it satisfies the condition specified in premise 2, which states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
