            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement simply states that Mark purchased a blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothetical situation is that Lisa bought the red shirt, and the consequence is that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTo infer that Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to assume that the hypothetical situation in the second statement is true, and then evaluate the consequence. In other words, we need to assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt, and then see if the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) follows logically.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
