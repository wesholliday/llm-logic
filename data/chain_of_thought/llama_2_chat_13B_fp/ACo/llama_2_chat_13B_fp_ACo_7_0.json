If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Chris finished the race. This statement simply tells us that Chris completed the race.\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. It creates a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these statements. If we know that Chris finished the race, we can infer that Alex also finished the race, because the conditional statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, we cannot directly infer that Alex finished the race based on the first statement alone (Chris finished the race).\n\nAnswer: no",
