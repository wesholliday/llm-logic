            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow', we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow' implies that if the apple is red, then the banana cannot be yellow. This is because the premise 'the apple was red' implies the possibility that the banana is not yellow.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the premises of the first statement. In other words, we need to assume that the banana is yellow and see if it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nIf we assume that the banana is yellow, then the first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow' becomes false. This is because if the banana is yellow, then it is possible that the apple is red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' based on the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
