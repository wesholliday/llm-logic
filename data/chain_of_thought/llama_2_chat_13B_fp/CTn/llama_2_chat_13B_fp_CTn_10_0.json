This means that the cat cannot be outside, as the statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside' is true.\n\nNow, let's assume that the cat is outside. This means that the dog cannot be inside, as the statement 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
