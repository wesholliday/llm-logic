            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nFirst, let's assume that Tom watched football. This means that Jen did not watch basketball, as the given statement states 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football'. This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it states that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
