            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal', we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal' implies that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck cannot be made of metal. This is because plastic and metal are two different materials that cannot coexist in the same object.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the truck is made of metal, we can logically deduce that the doll cannot be made of plastic. This leads us to the conclusion 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
