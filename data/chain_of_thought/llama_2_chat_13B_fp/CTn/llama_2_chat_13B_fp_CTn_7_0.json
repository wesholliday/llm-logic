            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race\" implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This is because the word \"if\" indicates a hypothetical situation, and the phrase \"then Chris did not finish the race\" is a logical consequence of the hypothetical situation.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the statement \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" is true. To do this, we need to reverse the order of the conditions in the original statement.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the original statement as \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race\". Now, if we reverse the order of the conditions, we get \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
