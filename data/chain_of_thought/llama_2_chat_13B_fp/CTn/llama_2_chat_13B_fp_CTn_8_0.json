This is because the statement is a negative statement, meaning that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy cannot be awake.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\", we need to reverse the logic of the original statement. This means that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must be asleep.\n\nAnswer: no",
