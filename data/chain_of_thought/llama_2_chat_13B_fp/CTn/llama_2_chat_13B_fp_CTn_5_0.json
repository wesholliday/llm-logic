This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy's not playing tennis is a necessary consequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. This statement is the converse of the original statement, meaning that if we assume that Amy played tennis, we can deduce that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement and the principle of logical implication, we can infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
