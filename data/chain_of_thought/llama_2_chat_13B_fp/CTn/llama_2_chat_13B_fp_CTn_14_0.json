This means that the wolf was not in the den, as the statement tells us.\n\nNow, let's assume that the wolf was in the den. This means that the bear was not in the cave, as we have just inferred.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
