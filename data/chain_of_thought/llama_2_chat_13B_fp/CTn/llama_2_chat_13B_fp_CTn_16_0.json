            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the antecedent is 'the shirt was cotton' and the consequent is 'the pants were not denim'.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we need to negate the antecedent and keep the consequent the same. So, the opposite statement would be 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nNow, we need to check if the opposite statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIf we substitute 'not cotton' for 'cotton' in the original statement, we get:\n\n'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as the negation of 'cotton' does not change the truth value of the statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
