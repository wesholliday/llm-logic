            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nThe given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and the conclusion is 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we need to negate the condition. So, the negation of 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nNow, we can construct the opposite statement by using the negation of the condition and the original conclusion:\n\n'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'\n\nComparing this statement with the original statement, we can see that the order of the names has been reversed, but the meaning remains the same.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
