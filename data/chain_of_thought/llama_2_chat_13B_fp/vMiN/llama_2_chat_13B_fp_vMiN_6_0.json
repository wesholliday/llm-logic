This premise is true if Sue did not choose pizza, and false if Sue did choose pizza.\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" is obtained by negating the premise \"Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This conclusion is true if Sue did not choose pizza, and false if Sue did choose pizza.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical validity of the argument. The premise \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" is a possibility, and the conclusion \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" is obtained by negating the premise. This means that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
