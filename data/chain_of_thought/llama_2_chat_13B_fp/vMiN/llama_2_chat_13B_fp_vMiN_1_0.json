            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument we are considering has the form of a modus ponens, with the premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" and the conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" To determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" is a possibility, which means that there is a non-zero probability that Mary was not at the wedding. This premise is not a guarantee that Mary was not at the wedding, but rather a statement that it is possible that she was not there.\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is derived from the premise by using the negation of the phrase \"Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This conclusion states that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which is equivalent to saying that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical validity of the argument. The premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" is a possibility, and the conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is a negation of that premise. This means that the argument is logically valid if the premise is true, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
