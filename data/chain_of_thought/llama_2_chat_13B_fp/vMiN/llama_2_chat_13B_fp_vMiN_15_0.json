To determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise 'The shoes might not be in the closet' implies that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet. This means that the conclusion 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' is a logical consequence of the premise. In other words, if the shoes might not be in the closet, then it is not the case that they must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
