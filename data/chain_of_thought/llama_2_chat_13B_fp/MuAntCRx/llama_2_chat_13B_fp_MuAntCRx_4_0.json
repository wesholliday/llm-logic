However, it does not necessarily follow that the glorp is also present in the plonk wump.\n\nTo infer that the glorp is in the plonk wump, we would need additional information or context that suggests the glorp is present in both the flibbit blimp and the plonk wump. Without such information, we cannot logically infer that the glorp is in the plonk wump based solely on the statement \"The glorp must be in the flibbit blimp.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
