It does not provide any information about the language of the movie, but it does suggest that the movie could be in a language other than English if it has subtitles.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the movie might be in English or it might be subtitled, but we cannot infer with certainty that it is in English or that it has subtitles.\n\nAnswer: no",
