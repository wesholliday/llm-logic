However, it does not explicitly state that the keys might be in both locations.\n\nTo infer that the keys might be in both the drawer and on the table, we would need additional information or context. For example, if the speaker has recently used the keys and left them in one of those locations, it would be reasonable to infer that they might be in either place. However, without any additional information, we cannot infer that the keys might be in both locations.\n\nAnswer: no",
