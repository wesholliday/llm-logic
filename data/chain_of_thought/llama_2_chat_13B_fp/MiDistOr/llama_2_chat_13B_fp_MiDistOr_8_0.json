If the restaurant is closed on Mondays, then it would not be open for limited hours. Therefore, if the restaurant is closed on Mondays, we can infer that it is not open for limited hours.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the possibility that the restaurant might be open for limited hours. If the restaurant is open for limited hours, then it is not closed on Mondays. Therefore, if the restaurant is open for limited hours, we can infer that it is not closed on Mondays.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
