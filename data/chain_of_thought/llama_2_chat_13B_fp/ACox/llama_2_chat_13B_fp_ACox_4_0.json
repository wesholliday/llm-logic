The second statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would crinkle. However, it does not explicitly state that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer that the fribble was snurgled. The statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
