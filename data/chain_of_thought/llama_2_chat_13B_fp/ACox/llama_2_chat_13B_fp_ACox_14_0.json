The second statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked' implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have been crinked.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'The fribble was snurgled' from the first two statements. To do this, we can use a technique called logical deduction.\n\nWe know that 'The fribble was crinked' and 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked'. We can deduce that if the fribble was crinked, then it must have been snurgled, because the second statement implies that snurgling leads to crinkling.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The fribble was snurgled' from 'The fribble was crinked' together with 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
