In other words, cranking the sprocket leads to it being dagged.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If the sprocket was daggled, then it must have been cranked, because cranking the sprocket leads to it being dagged. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
