The smip is not lupped.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the smip is shripped based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.\n\nThis statement means that the smip is either lupped or shripped, but it cannot be both.\n\n2. The smip is not lupped.\n\nThis statement means that the smip is not lupped.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities:\n\nIf the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped, because the first statement tells us that the smip is either lupped or shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped based on the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
