The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the zinger is fraggled based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the zinger is either smoogled or fraggled. This means that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the zinger is not smoogled. This means that the zinger cannot be smoogled.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled, since it cannot be smoogled. This is because the only two options for the zinger are smoogled and fraggled, and we have already ruled out smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
