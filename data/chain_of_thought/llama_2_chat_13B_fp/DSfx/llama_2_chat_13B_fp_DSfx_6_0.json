The grommet is not plopped.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the grommet is sploffed based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the grommet is either plopped or sploffed. This means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\nStatement 2 states that the grommet is not plopped. This means that the grommet cannot be plopped.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together. If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed (based on Statement 1). However, we know that the grommet is not plopped (based on Statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
