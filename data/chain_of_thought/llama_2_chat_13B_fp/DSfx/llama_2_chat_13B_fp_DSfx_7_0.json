The whiffle is not tinked.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the whiffle is shanked based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the whiffle is either tinked or shanked. This means that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nStatement 2 states that the whiffle is not tinked. This means that the whiffle cannot be tinked.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked (based on Statement 1). However, we know that the whiffle is not tinked (based on Statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
