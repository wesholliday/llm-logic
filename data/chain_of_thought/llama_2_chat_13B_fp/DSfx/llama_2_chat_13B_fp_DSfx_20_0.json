If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. Therefore, we can deduce that 'The fleeg is bluttered' from the first statement.\n\nHowever, we are also given that 'The fleeg is not surned'. This statement contradicts the first statement, as 'The fleeg is surned' is a necessary condition for 'The fleeg is bluttered'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
