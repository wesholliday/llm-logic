The splat is not quanked.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the splat is morphed based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the splat is either quanked or morphed. This means that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nStatement 2 states that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's put these two statements together. If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, according to Statement 1. But we already know that the splat is not quanked, according to Statement 2. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
