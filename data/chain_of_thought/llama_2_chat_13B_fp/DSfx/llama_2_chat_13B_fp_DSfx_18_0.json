The shank is not nugged.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that the shank is plooked based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\n\nThis statement means that there are only two possible states for the shank: nugged or plooked. If the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nStatement 2: The shank is not nugged.\n\nThis statement tells us that the shank is not in the nugged state. Therefore, based on statement 1, we can infer that the shank must be in the plooked state.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
