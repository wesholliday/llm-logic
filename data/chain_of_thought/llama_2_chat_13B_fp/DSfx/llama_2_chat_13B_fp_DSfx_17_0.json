If the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, since there is no other option left.\n\nSecond, we know that 'The flob is not movated' is a negative statement, which means that the flob is not in a state of being movated. This implies that the flob is in a state of being skizzled, since skizzled is the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
