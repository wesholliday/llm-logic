We need to determine if we can infer \"The glip is slogged\" based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged\" - This statement means that the glip is either tragged or slogged, but it cannot be both.\n2. \"The glip is not tragged\" - This statement means that the glip is not tragged.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The glip is tragged and not slogged. (This combination is not possible since we are told that the glip is not tragged.)\n\nCombination 2: The glip is slogged and not tragged. (This combination is possible since we are told that the glip is not tragged.)\n\nBased on the above combinations, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
