            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements: \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\" and \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" We need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\" - This statement means that the sprocket is either daggled or cranked, but it cannot be both.\n2. \"The sprocket is not daggled\" - This statement means that the sprocket is not in a daggled state.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible states of the sprocket:\n\n1. Daggled - This means that the sprocket is in a state where it is not functioning properly, and it may be causing problems in the system.\n2. Cranked - This means that the sprocket is in a state where it is functioning properly, and it is doing its job.\n\nGiven the two statements, we can infer that the sprocket is not daggled, and therefore, it must be cranked. This is because if the sprocket were daggled, we would have seen that in the first statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
