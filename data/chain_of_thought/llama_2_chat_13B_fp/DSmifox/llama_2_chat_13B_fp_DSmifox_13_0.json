It does not provide any information about the glip being slogged.\n2. \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\" - This statement implies that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. In other words, if the glip is not tragged, then it is slogged.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements relate to each other. If the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged, according to the second statement. However, the first statement does not provide any information about the glip being slogged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip is slogged based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
