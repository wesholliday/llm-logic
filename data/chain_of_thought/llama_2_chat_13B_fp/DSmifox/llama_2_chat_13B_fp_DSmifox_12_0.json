This means that the statement 'The smip is not lupped' is a possible truth.\n\nSecondly, 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped' implies that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped. This means that if the smip is not lupped, then the statement 'The smip is shripped' is a necessary truth.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible truths of the two statements:\n\n1. 'The smip is not lupped' (possible truth of 'The smip might not be lupped')\n2. 'The smip is shripped' (necessary truth of 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped')\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer 'The smip is shripped' as a logical consequence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
