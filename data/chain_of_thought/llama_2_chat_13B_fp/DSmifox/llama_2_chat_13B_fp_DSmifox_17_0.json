If the flob is not motivated, then it is possible that it is skizzled. However, the fact that the flob might not be movated does not necessarily mean that it is skizzled.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the flob might be skizzled, but we cannot definitively say that it is skizzled. The reason is that the first statement only suggests that the flob might not be movated, and the second statement implies that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. However, we cannot conclude that the flob is skizzled based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
