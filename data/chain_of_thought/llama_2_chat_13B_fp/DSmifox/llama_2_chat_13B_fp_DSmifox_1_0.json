This means that the flugel could be in a state where it is not zargled, but it could also be in a state where it is zargled.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed' is a disjunctive statement, which means that it presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationships between these two statements. If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed, because the only other possibility is that it is zargled, which we have already ruled out. Therefore, we can infer that if the flugel might not be zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
