It does not provide any information about the current state of the splat.\n2. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" - This statement implies that the splat must be either quanked or morphed. It does not provide any information about the current state of the splat.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The splat is quanked\n\nIn this combination, both statements are true. The splat is quanked, and it must be quanked or it is morphed. Therefore, the splat is morphed.\n\nCombination 2: The splat is not quanked\n\nIn this combination, the first statement is false, and the second statement is true. The splat must be morphed if it is not quanked. Therefore, the splat is morphed.\n\nIn both combinations, the conclusion is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
