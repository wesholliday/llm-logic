The shank is nugged, and it is not plooked.\n\nCombination 2: The shank is not nugged\nIn this case, the first statement is false, and the second statement implies that the shank is plooked.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
