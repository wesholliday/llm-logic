This means that the fribble could be either crinked or not crinked.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled' implies that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it cannot be not snurgled.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can infer that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. This is because if the fribble is not crinked, it cannot be not snurgled, as stated in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
