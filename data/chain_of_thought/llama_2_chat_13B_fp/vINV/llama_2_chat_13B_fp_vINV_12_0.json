            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of one statement (Lucy went to the zoo) based on the satisfaction of another statement (Joe went to the park).\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This conclusion follows logically from the premise, because if Joe did not go to the park, then the condition specified in the premise (Joe went to the park) is not satisfied, and therefore the conclusion (Lucy did not go to the zoo) must be true.\n\nSo, the argument is structured as a conditional statement with a conclusion that logically follows from the premise. To determine its validity, we need to check if the premise is true for all possible values of the variables involved.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
