            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The doll was not plastic.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is:\n\n3. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is:\n\n3. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nStep 2: Identify the premises of the argument.\n\nThe premises of the argument are:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The doll was not plastic.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the premises support the conclusion.\n\nTo determine if the premises support the conclusion, we need to examine if the premises are true and if they logically entail the conclusion.\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This premise is a conditional statement, and its truth depends on the antecedent (if the doll was plastic) being true and the consequent (then the truck was metal) being true.\n\nThe second premise, The doll was not plastic, is a simple statement that is either true or false.\n\nNow, let's assume that the first premise is true, and the doll was plastic. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, as the first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Therefore, if the doll was plastic, the truck would be metal.\n\nHowever, if the doll was not plastic, then the truck would not be metal, as the first premise does not hold.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument.\n\nBased on the previous steps, we can see that the argument is logically valid if the premises are true. If the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal, and if the doll was not plastic, then the truck would not be metal. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
