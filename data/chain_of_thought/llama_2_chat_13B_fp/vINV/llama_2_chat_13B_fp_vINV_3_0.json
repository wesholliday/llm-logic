This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is 'the book was written by James' and the consequent is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'. This is also a conditional statement, where the antecedent is 'the book was not written by James' and the consequent is 'the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nTo make the argument logically valid, we need to ensure that the premise and the conclusion are logically connected. In other words, we need to ensure that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's assume that the premise 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true. If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, since the premise states that this is the case.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'. If the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel, since the premise states that only books written by James are mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, we can see that if the premise is true, then the conclusion logically follows. This means that the argument is logically valid, since the premise and the conclusion are logically connected.\n\nAnswer: yes",
