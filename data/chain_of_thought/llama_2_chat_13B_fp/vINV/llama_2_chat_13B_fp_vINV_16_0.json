In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premise to be true if the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise. If the shirt was cotton, then it is necessarily true that the pants were denim. Therefore, if the shirt was not cotton, it is necessarily true that the pants were not denim. This means that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.",
