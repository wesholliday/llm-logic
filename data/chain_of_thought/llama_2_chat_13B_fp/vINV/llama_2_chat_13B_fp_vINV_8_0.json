            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, where the \"if\" clause is \"the vampire was awake\" and the \"then\" clause is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" This is also a conditional statement, where the \"if\" clause is \"the vampire was not awake\" and the \"then\" clause is \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to ask whether it is possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise. If the vampire was awake, then it is necessarily true that the mummy was awake, since awakeness is a property that is shared by both vampires and mummies. Similarly, if the vampire was not awake, then it is necessarily true that the mummy was not awake, since the absence of awakeness is also a property that is shared by both vampires and mummies.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and it is not possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.",
