            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' and 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'. The conclusion is 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is 'the car was red'. If the condition is true, then the conclusion of the first premise is also true.\n\nThe second premise states that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. This is also a conditional statement, and the condition is 'the car was not red'. If the condition is true, then the conclusion of the second premise is also true.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion of the argument. The conclusion is 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'. This conclusion follows logically from the two premises. If the car was not red, then the first premise does not hold true, and therefore the second premise does not hold true either. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
