The premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This implies that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and ensure that the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the argument is structured as a conditional statement, where the conclusion is linked to the premise through the word \"if.\"\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
