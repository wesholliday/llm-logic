In other words, we need to check if the premise is sufficient to support the conclusion.\n\nLet's assume that the cake was not chocolate. If the cake was not chocolate, then the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is false. However, the conclusion \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" logically follows from this false premise.\n\nTherefore, we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
