            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument we are considering has the form of a hypothetical syllogism, where the premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and the conclusion is \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" To determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise of the argument is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of one statement (Alex finished the race) if another statement (Chris finished the race) is true. The conclusion of the argument is also a conditional statement, but with a negative premise (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to ask ourselves if it is necessarily true that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
