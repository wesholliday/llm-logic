            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, where the premise is a conditional statement and the conclusion is derived from it. The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. The conclusion is that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequences. The conclusion is derived from the premise by negating the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nThe antecedent of the conditional statement is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and the consequent is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" If we negate the antecedent, we get \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of this argument. A valid argument must have the following properties:\n\n1. The premises must be true.\n2. The conclusion must logically follow from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, as long as Mary was indeed at the wedding. However, the conclusion \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nIf Mary was not at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Sue was not at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was not at the wedding, such as illness, travel delays, or personal reasons. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
