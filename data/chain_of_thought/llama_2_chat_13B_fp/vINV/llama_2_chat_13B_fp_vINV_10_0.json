            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical validity. The argument has two premises: 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' and 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside'.\n\nThe first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This premise is making a claim about the relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location. The second premise states that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. This premise is making a claim about the relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location, but with the negation of the first premise.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The conclusion is 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside'. To see if this conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use a truth table.\n\n| Dog Inside | Cat Outside |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yes | Yes |\n| No | No |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside. This is because the first premise states that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside, and the second premise states that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
