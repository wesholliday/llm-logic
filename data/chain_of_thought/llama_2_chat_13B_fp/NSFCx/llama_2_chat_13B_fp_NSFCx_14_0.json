However, it does not explicitly state that the quorple will definitely fizzle and bimboozle.\n\nTo infer that the quorple might fizzle and bimboozle, we need to assume that the quorple has the ability to do both fizzle and bimboozle. This is not explicitly stated in the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the quorple might fizzle and bimboozle based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
