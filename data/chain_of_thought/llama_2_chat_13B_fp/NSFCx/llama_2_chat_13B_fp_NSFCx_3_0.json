However, it does not explicitly state that the quork might be in both places.\n\nTo infer that the quork might be in both the zazzle and the frazzle, we would need additional information or context that suggests the quork could be present in multiple locations. Without such information, we cannot logically infer that the quork might be in both places.\n\nAnswer: no",
