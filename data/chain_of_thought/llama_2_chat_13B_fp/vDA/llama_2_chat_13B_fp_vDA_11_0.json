            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the conclusion (the muffins were blueberry) depends on the truth of the antecedent (the cake was chocolate).\n\nThe second premise states that the cake was not chocolate. This is a negative statement, which means that the antecedent of the first premise (the cake was chocolate) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument (the muffins were not blueberry) follows logically from the premises. This is because if the antecedent of the first premise (the cake was chocolate) is false, then the conclusion of the first premise (the muffins were blueberry) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
