            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This premise is saying that there is a conditional relationship between Jeff's action and Amy's action.\n\nThe second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball. This premise is saying that the condition specified in the first premise did not occur.\n\nThe conclusion states that Amy did not play tennis. This conclusion logically follows from the second premise, since if Jeff did not play basketball, then the condition specified in the first premise did not occur, and therefore, Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
