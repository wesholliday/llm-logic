This premise is in the form of a biconditional, which is a valid logical form.\n\nThe second premise states that Alex did not finish the race. This premise is a negative statement, and it is not necessarily true that the negation of a negative statement is true. However, in this case, if Alex did not finish the race, then it is certain that Chris did not finish the race, since the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
