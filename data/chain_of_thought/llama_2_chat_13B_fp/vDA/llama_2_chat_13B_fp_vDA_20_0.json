If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The apple was not red.\n\nAnd the conclusion is:\n\n3. The banana was not yellow.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true, i.e., the apple was not red. This means that the condition specified in the first premise does not hold, and therefore the conclusion cannot logically follow.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
