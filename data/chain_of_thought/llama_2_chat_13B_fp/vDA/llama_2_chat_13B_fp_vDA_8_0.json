            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of one statement (the mummy was awake) based on the satisfaction of another statement (the vampire was awake).\n\nThe second premise states that the vampire was not awake. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the falsehood of the statement \"the vampire was awake\".\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the mummy was not awake. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, since if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the form of the argument to determine its logical validity. The argument is a deductive argument, which means that it is intended to establish a conclusion with absolute certainty. The conclusion of the argument follows logically from the premises, and there is no possibility of the conclusion being false if the premises are true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
