            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the truth of one statement (the unicorn was in the forest) based on the satisfaction of another statement (the griffin was in the forest).\n\nThe second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the falsehood of the statement \"the griffin was in the forest\".\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the unicorn was not in the forest. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, since if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest (by the first premise).\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, since if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
