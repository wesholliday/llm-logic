            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This premise is in the form of a biconditional, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nThe second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. This premise is a negative statement, and it is important to note that the negation of a statement does not necessarily make it false.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Sue was not at the wedding. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, since if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as it follows the rules of logical validity and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
