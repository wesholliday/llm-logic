            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts the existence of a certain condition (the doll being plastic) and its consequences (the truck being metal).\n\nThe second premise states that the doll was not plastic. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the absence of a certain condition (the doll being plastic).\n\nThe conclusion states that the truck was not metal. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, since if the doll was not plastic, then the truck could not have been metal.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of this argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, let's assume that the premises are true. If the doll was not plastic, then it is certain that the truck was not metal. This is because the first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal. Since the doll was not plastic, it is not possible for the truck to have been metal. Therefore, the conclusion that the truck was not metal logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
