This premise is saying that there is a conditional relationship between the authorship of the book and the genre of the book.\n\nThe second premise states that the book was not written by James. This premise is saying that the book does not have the authorship of James.\n\nThe conclusion states that the book is not a mystery novel. This conclusion logically follows from the second premise, as if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
