            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This premise is saying that there is a conditional relationship between Joe's actions and Lucy's actions.\n\nThe second premise states that Joe did not go to the park. This premise is a negative statement, which means that the condition specified in the first premise did not occur.\n\nThe conclusion states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This conclusion follows logically from the second premise, since if Joe did not go to the park, then the condition specified in the first premise did not occur, and therefore Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise sets up a conditional relationship between Joe's and Lucy's actions, and the second premise denies the occurrence of the condition specified in the first premise, which leads logically to the conclusion that Lucy did not go to the zoo.",
