            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"the bear was in the cave.\"\n\nThe second premise states that the bear was not in the cave. This is a negative statement, and it negates the condition in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the wolf was not in the den. This conclusion follows logically from the negative statement in the second premise, which negates the condition in the first premise.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument using the rules of logical validity:\n\n1. The argument has a clear structure: premises (1 and 2) and a conclusion (3).\n2. The premises are related to each other: the first premise states a condition, and the second premise negates that condition.\n3. The conclusion logically follows from the premises: if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nBased on these criteria, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
