            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and the truth of its premises. The argument has the following form:\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\nThe shirt was not cotton\nTherefore, the pants were not denim\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of deductive argument that uses a disjunction (either-or) to arrive at a conclusion. In this case, the disjunction is \"the shirt was cotton\" or \"the shirt was not cotton\", and the conclusion is \"the pants were not denim\".\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to consider whether the premises are true and whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes",
