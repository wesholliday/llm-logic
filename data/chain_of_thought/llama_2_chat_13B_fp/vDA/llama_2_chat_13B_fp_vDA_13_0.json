The conditional statement is valid if the antecedent (the \"if\" clause) is false, then the consequent (the \"then\" clause) must be false.\n\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The car was not red.\" This premise is a negative statement, which means that the antecedent of the first premise (the \"if\" clause) is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the consequent of the first premise (the \"then\" clause) is false, which means that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
