            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This premise is saying that there is a conditional relationship between Lisa's purchase and Mark's purchase.\n\nThe second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This premise is a negative statement, and it denies the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This conclusion follows logically from the second premise, since if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the conditional statement in the first premise cannot be true, and therefore Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument. A valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, since the second premise denies the antecedent of the first premise, and the first premise is a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
