If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. Jen might not have watched basketball: This statement implies that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball. It does not provide any definitive information about whether she did or did not watch basketball.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball: This statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. It does not provide any information about whether Tom actually watched football.\n\nNow, let's consider the combination of these two statements. We can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
