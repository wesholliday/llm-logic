If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Sam did not take a plane.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that Erin might have taken a different mode of transportation, but it does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nStatement 2 implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin would not have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Sam took a plane.\nIn this scenario, Erin must have taken a train, as per statement 2. However, statement 1 tells us that Erin might not have taken a train, which means that Erin could have taken a different mode of transportation. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based on this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: Sam did not take a plane.\nIn this scenario, Erin would not have taken a train, as per statement 2. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane based on this scenario.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
