            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that the absence of Sue at the wedding is a possibility, but it does not necessarily mean that she was not there.\n\nStatement 2 states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue's attendance is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these statements together. If we combine them, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue must not have been at the wedding either. This is because if Mary did not attend the wedding, then the condition in statement 2 (i.e., \"if Mary was at the wedding\") would not be met, and therefore Sue's attendance would not be guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue must not have been at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: no",
