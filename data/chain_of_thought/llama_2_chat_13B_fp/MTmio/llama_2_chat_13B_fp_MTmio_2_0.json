This means that if the griffin was present in the forest, the unicorn would also have to be present.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements can be used to infer the presence or absence of the griffin in the forest. If we combine the two statements, we can deduce the following:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest (based on statement 2).\n\nHowever, we are also told that the unicorn might not have been in the forest (based on statement 1).\n\nSo, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest, but we are also told that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot determine whether the unicorn was or was not in the forest based on these two statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether the griffin was or was not in the forest based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
