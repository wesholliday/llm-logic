If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the desired conclusion.\n\nLet's first consider statement 1: Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This statement implies that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that he did not buy it.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The statements do not provide enough information to make such an inference. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
