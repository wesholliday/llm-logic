            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. The book might not be a mystery novel.\n2. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book was not written by James. To do this, we need to evaluate the two statements and see if we can deduce anything about the book's authorship.\n\nLet's consider the first statement: \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, but it does not provide any definitive information about the book's genre.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, and there is no possibility that it could be any other genre.\n\nSo, if we combine these two statements, we can deduce that if the book was not written by James, then it must not be a mystery novel. In other words, if the book was written by someone other than James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The book was not written by James'?\" is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
