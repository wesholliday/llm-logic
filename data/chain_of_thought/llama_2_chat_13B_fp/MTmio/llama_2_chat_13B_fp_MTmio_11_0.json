To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the third statement.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the first statement:\n\n1. \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\"\n\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. It does not provide any definitive information about the muffins' flavor.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\nThis statement implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry. However, this statement does not provide any information about the actual flavor of the cake.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we cannot infer whether the cake was not chocolate. We only know that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry, and that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
