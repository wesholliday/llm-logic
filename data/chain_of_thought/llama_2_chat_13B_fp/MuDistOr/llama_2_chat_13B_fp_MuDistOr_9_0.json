The word \"or\" indicates that the package could have been delivered by either method, but not both.\n\nTo infer \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane,\" we need to rephrase the original statement in a more negative form. This can be done by using the word \"not\" to negate the second part of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
