However, the word \"or\" used in the statement suggests that the product only needs to meet one of these conditions, not both.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the statement \"The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable\" can be simplified to \"The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
