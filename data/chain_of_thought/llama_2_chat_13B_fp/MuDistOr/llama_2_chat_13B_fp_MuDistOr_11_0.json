However, if the exam was essay-based, then it could have been either multiple choice or essay-based, as there is no requirement for essay questions to be multiple choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the exam must have been both multiple choice and essay-based based solely on the statement \"The exam must have been multiple choice or essay-based.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
