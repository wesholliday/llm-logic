To infer the second sentence \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack,\" we need to consider the possibility that the book was in both locations.\n\nThe word \"or\" in the original sentence indicates that the book could be in one of two places, but it does not imply that the book must be in both places. Therefore, we cannot infer the second sentence based solely on the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
