The word \"or\" indicates that the payment could have been made by either credit card or bank transfer, but not both.\n\nTo infer \"The payment must have been made by credit card or it must have been made by bank transfer,\" we need to rephrase the statement to make it more inclusive of both options. This rephrased statement is in the form of a disjunctive sentence, where the two options are presented as alternatives.\n\nAnswer: yes",
