This means that if the movie was in English, then it did not need to be subtitled, and if it was subtitled, then it was not in English.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the statement \"The movie must have been in English or it must have been subtitled\" is a logical consequence of the original statement. This inference is based on the fact that the original statement implies that the movie could not have been both in English and subtitled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
