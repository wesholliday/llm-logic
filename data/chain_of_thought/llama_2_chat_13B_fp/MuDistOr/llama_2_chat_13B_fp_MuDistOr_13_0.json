This is because the word \"or\" is used to indicate a choice between two options, and the two options are \"salad\" and \"soup\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the meal included a salad, then it did not include soup, and if it included soup, then it did not include a salad. This is because the meal can only contain one of the two options, and not both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
