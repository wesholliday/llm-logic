In this case, the two alternatives are \"the legal team\" and \"the CEO.\" This means that the contract must have been approved by either the legal team or the CEO.\n\nHowever, the statement does not specify that the contract must have been approved by both the legal team and the CEO. Therefore, we can infer that the contract only needs to be approved by one of the two, either the legal team or the CEO.\n\nAnswer: yes",
