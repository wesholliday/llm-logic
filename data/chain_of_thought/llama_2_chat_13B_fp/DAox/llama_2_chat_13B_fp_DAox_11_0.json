This implies that the flug did not receive any blumming treatment, which is a necessary condition for zimming.\n\nSecondly, we know that 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' means that if the flug had undergone bluming, then it would have received zimming treatment. This implies that if the flug had been blummed, it would have been zimmed.\n\nNow, based on the first statement, we know that the flug did not undergo bluming. Therefore, we can infer that the flug did not receive zimming treatment, which means that 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
