To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can draw any conclusions from them.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1: \"The shank was not plooked\". This statement simply tells us that the shank was not plooked, but it doesn't give us any information about whether the shank was nugged or not.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". This statement tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. However, this statement only applies if the shank was plooked in the first place. Since we know that the shank was not plooked (according to statement 1), we can't use this statement to infer anything about whether the shank was nugged or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements we have, we cannot infer whether the shank was nugged or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
