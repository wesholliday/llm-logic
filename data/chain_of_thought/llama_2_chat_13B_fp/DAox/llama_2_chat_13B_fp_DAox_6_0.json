It does not provide any information about the grommet plopping the frink.\n\nStatement 2: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\nThis statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. However, it does not provide any information about the grommet not plopping the frink.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical relationship between these two statements. If the grommet did not sploff, then it is not possible for it to have plopped the frink, since plopping the frink is a consequence of sploffing. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
