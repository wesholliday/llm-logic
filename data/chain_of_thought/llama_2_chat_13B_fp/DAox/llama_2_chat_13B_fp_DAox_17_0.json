The second statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' implies that if the flob was subjected to skizzling, then it must have undergone a certain process or transformation, which is referred to as 'movated'.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the flob was not skizzled, then it is not possible for it to have undergone the process of movation, since movation only occurs if the flob is skizzled. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flob was not movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
