This means that the wug did not undergo the state of being flooped.\n\nSecondly, we know that 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' implies that if the wug had been flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint. This implies that the wug did not bim the zoint, because we know that it did not undergo the state of being flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: no",
