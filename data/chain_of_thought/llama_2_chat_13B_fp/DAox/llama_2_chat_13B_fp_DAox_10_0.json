It does not provide any information about the wug's garpledness.\n\nStatement 2: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n\nThis statement implies that if the wug was sproinged, then it must be garpled. However, it does not provide any information about the wug's current state.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these statements to infer the wug's garpledness:\n\nIf the wug was not sproinged, then it cannot be garpled, because if it were garpled, it would have been sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: no",
