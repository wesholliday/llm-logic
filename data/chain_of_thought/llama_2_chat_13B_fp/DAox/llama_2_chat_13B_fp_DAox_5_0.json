This means that the zinger did not experience any damage or harm.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled. This means that if the zinger had experienced any damage or harm, then it would have been smoogled.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer based on these two statements. If the zinger was not fraggled, then it did not experience any damage or harm. This means that it is not possible for the zinger to have been smoogled, because smoogling only occurs when something is damaged or harmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
