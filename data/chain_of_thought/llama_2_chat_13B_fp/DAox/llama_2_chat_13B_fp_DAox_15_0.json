This statement tells us that the dreb was not vroomed, but it does not provide any information about whether the dreb was spened or not.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. This statement tells us that if the dreb was vroomed, then it must have been spened. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the dreb was actually vroomed or not.\n\nSo, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not spened'. We do not have enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
