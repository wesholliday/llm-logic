This means that the fribble did not change its state in any way, as snurgling would have caused it to do so.\n\nSecondly, the statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' implies that if the fribble had undergone snurgling, it would have resulted in the fribble changing its state and becoming crinked.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we can logically infer that the fribble did not crink, because if it had crinked, it would have been snurgled first, which we know did not happen.\n\nAnswer: no",
