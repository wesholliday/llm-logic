This means that the smonk did not have the characteristic of being vreebled, whatever that might mean.\n\nSecondly, the statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' implies that if the smonk had been vreebled, then it would have had the property of being plagged. This means that the presence of vreebledness would have led to the presence of plaggedness.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\nIf the smonk was not vreebled, then it did not have the property of being vreebled. And if it did not have the property of being vreebled, then it cannot have the property of being plagged, since plaggedness is a consequence of vreebledness.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The smonk was not plagged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
