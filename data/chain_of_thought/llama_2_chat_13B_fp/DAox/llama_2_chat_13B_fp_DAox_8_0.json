            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. \"The sprocket was not cranked\"\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n\nWe want to infer whether the sprocket was not daggled. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can deduce the desired conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1. \"The sprocket was not cranked\" means that the sprocket was not rotated or turned. This statement is simply a factual statement and does not provide any information about the daggling of the sprocket.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" means that if the sprocket was rotated or turned, then it was also daggled. This statement implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can deduce that if the sprocket was not cranked, then it was not daggled. This is because if the sprocket was not cranked, then it cannot be daggled, since daggling only occurs when the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
