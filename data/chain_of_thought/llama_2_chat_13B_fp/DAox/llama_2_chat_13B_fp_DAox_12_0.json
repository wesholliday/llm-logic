'The smip was not shripped' - This statement simply means that the smip was not in a shriveled state.\n2. 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' - This statement implies that if the smip was in a shriveled state (i.e., 'shripped'), then it would have 'lupped' (i.e., consumed) the 'zoint'.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements. If the smip was not shripped, then it cannot have lupped the zoint, because the second statement implies that shripping is a necessary condition for lupping. Therefore, we can infer that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no",
