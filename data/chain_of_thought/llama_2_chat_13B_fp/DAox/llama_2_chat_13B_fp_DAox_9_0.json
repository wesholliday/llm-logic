This means that the twonk did not undergo the process of plinking.\n\nThe second premise is 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'. This means that if the twonk had undergone the process of plinking, then it would have been varnished.\n\nNow, we can deduce that since the twonk was not plinked, it did not undergo the process of varnishing. Therefore, we can infer 'The twonk was not varnished'.\n\nAnswer: no",
