This means that the flugel did not undergo any modification or alteration that would change its original state.\n\nSecondly, we know that 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' implies that if the flugel was subjected to blimming, then it must have undergone a certain process or transformation that resulted in it being zargled.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\nIf the flugel was not blimmed, then it did not undergo any modification or alteration that would change its original state. Therefore, it is not possible for the flugel to have been zargled, since zargling requires blimming.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
