To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The whiffle did not tink\" based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the whiffle was not shanked. In this case, the second statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" does not apply, as the whiffle was not shanked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the whiffle tinked.\n\nOn the other hand, if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked, according to the second statement. However, we know that the whiffle was not shanked, so we cannot infer that the whiffle tinked in this case either.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer whether the whiffle did not tink based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
