The movie might be playing at the cinema.\n2. The movie might be sold out.\n\nWe can start by considering the first statement. If the movie is playing at the cinema, then it is possible that it is not sold out. However, if the movie is not playing at the cinema, then it is certain that it is not sold out.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the movie is sold out, then it cannot be playing at the cinema. Therefore, if the movie is sold out, we can conclude that it is not playing at the cinema.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that if the movie is playing at the cinema, then it might not be sold out. However, if the movie is sold out, then it cannot be playing at the cinema. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie might be playing and sold out at the cinema.\n\nAnswer: no",
