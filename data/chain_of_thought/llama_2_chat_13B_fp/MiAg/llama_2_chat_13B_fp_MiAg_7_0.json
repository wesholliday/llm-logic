The second statement 'The train might be crowded' implies that there might be a lot of people on the train.\n\nIf the train is late, it is likely that more people will be on the train, as they will have had to wait longer for it to arrive. Therefore, we can infer that if the train is late, it is also likely to be crowded.\n\nAnswer: yes",
