This statement alone does not provide enough information to infer that the cat is sleeping in the garden. The cat could be in the garden for various reasons, such as exploring, hunting, or simply enjoying the outdoors.\n\nThe second statement is 'The cat might be sleeping'. This statement does provide some information that could support the inference that the cat is sleeping in the garden. However, it is not sufficient on its own to make the inference.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'The cat might be sleeping in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: No",
