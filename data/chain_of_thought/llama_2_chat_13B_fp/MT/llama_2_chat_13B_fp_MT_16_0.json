            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the given statements, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt and the pants.\n\nThe second statement \"The pants were not denim\" means that the pants were not made of denim. This statement contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the pants were not made of denim, even if the shirt was made of cotton.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these statements. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim, but since the pants were not denim, it follows that the shirt was not cotton. This inference is based on the fact that the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt and the pants, and the second statement contradicts that relationship.\n\nAnswer:\n\nyes",
