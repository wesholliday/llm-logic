            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the apple was not red based on the statements \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was not yellow,\" we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow. In other words, if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana would have the property of being yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This statement tells us that the banana does not have the property of being yellow.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the apple does not have the property of being red. Here's why:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow, but the banana is not yellow. Therefore, the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
