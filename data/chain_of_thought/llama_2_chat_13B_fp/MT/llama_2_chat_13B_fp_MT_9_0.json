Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nOur goal is to determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nLet's assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt. If she did, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt because Lisa bought the red shirt, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
