The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nWe want to infer whether the griffin was not in the forest based on these two statements. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"The griffin was not in the forest\" based on the given information.\n\nLet's assume that the griffin was in the forest. Then, according to statement 1, the unicorn would also be in the forest. However, statement 2 tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that the griffin cannot be in the forest, as the unicorn is not there.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
