In this case, the antecedent is 'Jeff played basketball' and the consequent is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nSince the premise 'Amy did not play tennis' is true, we can conclude that the antecedent 'Jeff played basketball' is false. Therefore, the conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is not valid, and we cannot infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
