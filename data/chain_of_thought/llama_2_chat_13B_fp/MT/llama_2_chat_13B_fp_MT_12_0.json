            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given information, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This statement tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo, regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it means that Joe did not go to the park. This is because if Joe had gone to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it means that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
