Chris did not finish the race.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" given the information that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nLet's assume that Alex did finish the race. If Alex finished the race, then by the first statement, Chris would have finished the race as well. However, we know that Chris did not finish the race, so this assumption leads to a logical contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
