The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the book was not written by James. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the conclusion based on the given statements.\n\nLet's assume that the book was written by James. Then, according to statement 1, the book is a mystery novel. However, statement 2 tells us that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the book cannot be both a mystery novel and not written by James, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
