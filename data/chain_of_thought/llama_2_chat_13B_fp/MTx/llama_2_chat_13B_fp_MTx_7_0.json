This means that if the whiffle was shanked (i.e., hit with a lot of force), it would produce a tinkling sound.\n\nThe second premise is 'The whiffle did not tink.' This means that the whiffle did not produce a tinkling sound.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two premises. If the whiffle was shanked, it would produce a tinkling sound, but since it did not produce a tinkling sound, we can infer that it was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
