This statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between fraggling and smoogling.\n\nThe second statement 'The zinger was not smoogled' indicates that the zinger was not repaired or fixed. This statement provides additional information about the zinger's state.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to draw: 'The zinger was not fraggled'. To make this inference, we need to use the information from the first statement and the second statement.\n\nIf the zinger was fraggled, then it would have been smoogled, according to the first statement. However, since the zinger was not smoogled, as stated in the second statement, it follows that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, the inference we can draw is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
