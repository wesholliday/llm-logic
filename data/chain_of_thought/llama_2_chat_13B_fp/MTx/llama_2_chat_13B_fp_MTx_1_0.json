This implies that if the flugel was blimmed, it must have been zargled.\n\nThe second premise states that the flugel was not zargled. This means that the flugel was not subjected to the process of zargling.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can deduce that the flugel was not blimmed. This is because if the flugel was blimmed, it would have been zargled, but since it was not zargled, it must not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
