This means that if the twonk was plinked, it would have been varnished, and there would be no possibility of it not being varnished.\n\nThe second statement \"The twonk was not varnished\" implies that the twonk was not varnished. This statement contradicts the first statement, as if the twonk was not varnished, it cannot be inferred that it was plinked.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we cannot infer that the twonk was not plinked. The statements are contradictory, and we cannot logically deduce anything about the twonk's plinkedness.\n\nAnswer: no",
