The consequent of the implication is 'then the glip was tragged', which means that the glip was in a certain state or condition.\n\nSince we know that 'The glip was not tragged', we can infer that the glip was not in the state or condition described by the consequent of the implication. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip was not subjected to the action or process described by the antecedent of the implication.\n\nIn other words, if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
