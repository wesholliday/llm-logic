This means that if the smip was shripped, it would have performed the action of luping the zoint.\n\nThe second statement 'The smip did not lup the zoint' implies that the smip did not perform the action of luping the zoint. This means that the smip did not shrip the zoint.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements. If the smip was shripped, then it would have luped the zoint, but it did not lup the zoint, so it was not shripped. Therefore, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
