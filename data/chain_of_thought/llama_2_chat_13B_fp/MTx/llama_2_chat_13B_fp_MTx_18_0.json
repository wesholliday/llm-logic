To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the statements and see if we can logically deduce the desired conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's analyze statement 1: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". This statement is saying that if the shank was plooked (whatever that means), then it must have been nugged. The word \"then\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship, so if the shank was plooked, it must have had some effect on it.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \"The shank was not nugged\". This statement is saying that the shank was not in a nugged state. This is a negative statement, so we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nSo, putting the two statements together, we can logically deduce that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
