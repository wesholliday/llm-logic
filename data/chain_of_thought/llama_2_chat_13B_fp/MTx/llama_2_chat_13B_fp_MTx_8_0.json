            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n2. The sprocket was not daggled.\n\nOur goal is to infer whether the sprocket was not cranked. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth of the two statements and see if we can logically deduce that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nLet's start by examining the first statement:\n\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThis statement is saying that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, we are also given that the sprocket was not daggled, which means that the sprocket cannot have been cranked. Therefore, we can deduce that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nNow, let's examine the second statement:\n\n2. The sprocket was not daggled.\n\nThis statement is saying that the sprocket was not in a state of being daggled. However, we have already deduced that the sprocket was not cranked, and being cranked is a necessary condition for being daggled. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
