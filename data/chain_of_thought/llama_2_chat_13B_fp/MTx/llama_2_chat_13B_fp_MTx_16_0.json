This statement implies that cramping the sneg leads to sproting the frink.\n\nThe second statement is 'The sneg did not sproted the frink.' This statement indicates that the sneg did not sprot the frink, which means that the sneg was not cramped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion. If the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink, but since it did not sprot the frink, it must not have been cramped. Therefore, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
