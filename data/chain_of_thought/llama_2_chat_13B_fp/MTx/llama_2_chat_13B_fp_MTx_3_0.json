            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer that the splat was not morphed based on the statements \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" and \"The splat did not quank,\" we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked, according to the first statement. However, the second statement tells us that the splat did not quank. This means that the splat cannot be both morphed and not quank, as these two statements are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed, as the possibility of it being morphed and not quanking is ruled out by the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
