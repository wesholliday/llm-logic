This means that flooping is a necessary condition for bimming the zoint.\n\nThe second statement 'The wug did not bim the zoint' tells us that the wug did not bim the zoint. This means that the wug did not fulfill the necessary condition for bimming the zoint, which is flooping.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
