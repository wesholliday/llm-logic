Notarization is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing the signing of the document.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the document must have been signed in the presence of a notary public or a witness, as signing a document without a witness or notary public may not be legally binding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
