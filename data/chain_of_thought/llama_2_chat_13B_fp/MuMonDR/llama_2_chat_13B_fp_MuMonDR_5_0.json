To infer \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today,\" we need to consider the possibility that the package might have been delivered on the next day, which is tomorrow.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the fact that the statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" only provides information about the current day and does not rule out the possibility of delivery on the next day. Therefore, we can infer that the package might have been delivered on either the current day or the next day, which is tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
