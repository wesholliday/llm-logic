However, it does not necessarily mean that the event was semi-formal or formal.\n\nTo infer that the event must have been semi-formal or formal, we need additional information. For example, if we know that the event was a black-tie affair or that it took place in a formal setting, such as a ballroom or a conference center, then we can infer that the event was semi-formal or formal.\n\nAnswer: No.",
