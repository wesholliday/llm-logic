However, it does not directly imply that the exam was easy or difficult.\n\nTo infer that the exam must have been easy or difficult, we need to consider additional information or context. For example, if we know that the exam was shorter than expected or had fewer questions than usual, we might infer that it was easier than expected. On the other hand, if we know that the exam was longer than expected or had more questions than usual, we might infer that it was more difficult than expected.\n\nTherefore, based on the statement \"The exam must have been difficult\", we cannot directly infer that the exam must have been easy or difficult.\n\nAnswer: No",
