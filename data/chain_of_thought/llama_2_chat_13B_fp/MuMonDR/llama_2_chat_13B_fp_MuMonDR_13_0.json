However, we can infer that the movie must have been subtitled or in English because:\n\n1. If the movie was only in English, it is likely that it was subtitled, as many movies are not filmed entirely in English.\n2. If the movie was not subtitled, it would be difficult for non-English speakers to understand the movie without English subtitles.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the movie must have been subtitled or in English.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
