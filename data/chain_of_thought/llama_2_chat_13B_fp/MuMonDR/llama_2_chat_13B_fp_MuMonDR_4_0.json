However, the word \"must\" implies a certain level of necessity or obligation, which suggests that the meeting was not just a casual gathering, but rather an important event that was expected to happen.\n\nFurthermore, the word \"scheduled\" implies that the meeting was planned in advance, which suggests that there was some level of intention or expectation that the meeting would take place.\n\nBased on these inferences, we can reasonably assume that the meeting was either cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
