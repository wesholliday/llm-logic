There could be several reasons why the restaurant was closed on Mondays, such as maintenance, staff training, or limited hours of operation.\n\nTo infer that the restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays, we need to consider the context of the statement and the possibility that the restaurant may have had limited hours of operation on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: yes",
