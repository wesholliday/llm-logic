However, it does not necessarily imply that the concert was postponed.\n\nTo infer that the concert must have been postponed or sold out, we need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the concert was scheduled to take place on a specific date and time, and that date and time have passed, then we can infer that the concert must have been postponed or sold out.\n\nAnswer: No.",
