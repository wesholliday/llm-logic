This suggests that the medicine was not taken on an empty stomach, as taking medication on an empty stomach is generally not recommended.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide enough information to infer that the medicine must have been taken on an empty stomach or with food. It only tells us that the medicine was taken with food, but it does not rule out the possibility that the medicine could have been taken on an empty stomach.\n\nAnswer: no",
