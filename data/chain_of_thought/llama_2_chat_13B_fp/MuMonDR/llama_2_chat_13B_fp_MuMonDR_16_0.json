To infer that the room must have been cleaned upon request, we would need additional information or context.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the room was cleaned daily, we can infer that it was likely cleaned at the same time every day, such as during the morning or evening. This inference is based on the fact that daily cleaning is a routine task that is typically performed at the same time each day.\n\nAnswer: no",
