This means that if the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements might be related. If the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted, according to the second statement. However, the first statement does not provide any information about the current state of the sneg, so we cannot infer that it is crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
