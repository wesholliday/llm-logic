If the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked, based on the second statement. However, the first statement tells us that the shank might not be nugged, which means that it might not be plooked either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
