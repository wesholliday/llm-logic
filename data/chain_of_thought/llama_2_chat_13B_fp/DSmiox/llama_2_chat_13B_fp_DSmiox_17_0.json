In other words, if the flob is not skizzled, then it must have some motivation.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\nCombination 1: The flob is skizzled and movated.\nCombination 2: The flob is not skizzled and not movated.\nCombination 3: The flob is skizzled but not movated.\n\nIn Combination 1, the flob is both skizzled and movated, so the statement \"The flob is skizzled\" is true.\n\nIn Combination 2, the flob is not skizzled and not movated, so the statement \"The flob is skizzled\" is false.\n\nIn Combination 3, the flob is skizzled but not movated, so the statement \"The flob is skizzled\" is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
