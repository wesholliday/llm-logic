This means that the fleeg could be either surned or not surned.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned' implies that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it cannot be not surned (i.e., it must be surned).\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the fleeg is not surned. If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered, because the second statement tells us that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned. Therefore, if the fleeg is not surned, then it is bluttered.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that if the fleeg is not surned, then it is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
