It does not provide any information about the whiffle being shanked.\n2. \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked\" - This statement implies that the whiffle is either shanked or tinked. It does not provide any information about the whiffle not being shanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. We can infer that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. This is because the second statement states that either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements together, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
