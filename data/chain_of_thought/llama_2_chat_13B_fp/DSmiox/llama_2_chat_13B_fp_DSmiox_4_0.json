This means that the fribble could be either crinked or not crinked.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked' states that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked. This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can infer that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. Therefore, the conclusion 'The fribble is snurgled' can be drawn.\n\nAnswer: yes",
