In order to infer \"The package might be delivered or delayed\", we need to consider additional information or context.\n\nFor example, if we know that the delivery company has a history of delays or if the package is being delivered during a busy time of year, it may be more likely that the package will be delayed. In this case, we can infer \"The package might be delivered or delayed\" based on the additional context.\n\nHowever, if we have no additional information or context, we cannot infer \"The package might be delivered or delayed\" solely based on the statement \"The package might be delivered\".\n\nAnswer: no",
