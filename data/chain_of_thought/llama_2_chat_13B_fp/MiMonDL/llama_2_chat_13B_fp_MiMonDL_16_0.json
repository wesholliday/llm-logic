However, it does not necessarily mean that the flight will be delayed or on time.\n\nTo infer \"The flight might be delayed or on time,\" we need additional information or context. For example, if the airline has a history of delays or if there are known issues with the flight route, then it may be more likely that the flight will be delayed. On the other hand, if the airline has a good reputation for punctuality and there are no known issues with the flight route, then it may be more likely that the flight will be on time.\n\nAnswer: no",
