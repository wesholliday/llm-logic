However, it does not explicitly mention anything about the meeting being rescheduled.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled,\" we need to make an additional assumption that if the meeting is cancelled, it might be rescheduled for a later date. This assumption is not directly implied in the original statement, but it is a reasonable inference based on the fact that meetings are often rescheduled when they need to be cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no",
