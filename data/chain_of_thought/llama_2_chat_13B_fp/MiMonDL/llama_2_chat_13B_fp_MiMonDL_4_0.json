In fact, the phrase 'The cat might be sleeping' suggests that the cat is not necessarily engaged in any specific activity, as sleeping is a state of inactivity.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat might be doing something else, such as playing, since playing is an activity that is distinct from sleeping.\n\nAnswer: yes",
