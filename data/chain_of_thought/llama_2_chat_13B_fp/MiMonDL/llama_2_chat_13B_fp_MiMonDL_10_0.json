However, it does not necessarily imply that the computer is definitely broken or that it is working.\n\nTo infer \"The computer might be broken or working,\" we need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the computer was working fine yesterday but is not turning on today, we can infer that it might be broken. However, if we have no other information and only know that the computer might be broken, we cannot infer that it is definitely broken or working.\n\nAnswer: no",
