However, it does not necessarily mean that the book is only present in that location.\n\nIf we assume that the book is only present in the location where the shelf is, then we can infer that the book might be on the shelf. However, if we consider the possibility that the book might be in other locations as well, such as the library, then we can infer that the book might be on the shelf or in the library.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer 'The book might be on the shelf or in the library'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
