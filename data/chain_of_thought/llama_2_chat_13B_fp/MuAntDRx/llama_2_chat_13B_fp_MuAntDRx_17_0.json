However, it does not necessarily follow that the froodle must be flimble.\n\nTo infer that the froodle must be flimble, we would need additional information or context that suggests that quorple and flimble are mutually exclusive qualities, or that flimble is a necessary condition for being a froodle. Without such information, we cannot logically infer that the froodle must be flimble based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
