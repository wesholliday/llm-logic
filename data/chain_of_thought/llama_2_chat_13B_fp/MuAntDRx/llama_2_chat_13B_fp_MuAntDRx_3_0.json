'The floob must be in the bimboozle'\n2. 'or on the quibble'\n\nThe first part of the statement implies that the floob must be inside the bimboozle. The second part of the statement provides an alternative location for the floob, which is on the quibble.\n\nTo infer 'The floob must be on the quibble', we need to determine if the second part of the statement is sufficient to conclude that the floob is only on the quibble and not inside the bimboozle.\n\nAnswer: no",
