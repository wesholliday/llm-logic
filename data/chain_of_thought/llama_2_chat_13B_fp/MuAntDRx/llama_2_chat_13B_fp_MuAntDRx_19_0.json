However, it does not explicitly state that the flibbit must be in plonk.\n\nTo infer that the flibbit must be in plonk, we would need additional information or context that suggests the flibbit is more likely to be in plonk than zibble wozzle. Without such information, we cannot infer that the flibbit must be in plonk based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
