The next word is 'gribble', which is a verb that means to chew or gnaw. The phrase 'a flim or frazzle' is an object that the grazzle must gribble.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the grazzle is a creature that must chew or gnaw on something, and the something is either a flim or a frazzle. However, this sentence does not provide enough information to determine whether the grazzle must be frazzle specifically.\n\nAnswer: no",
