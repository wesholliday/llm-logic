However, it does not directly imply that the wobble must be crunk.\n\nTo infer that the wobble must be crunk, we would need additional information or context that suggests that crunk is the only possible cause of the wobble. Without such information, we cannot infer that the wobble must be crunk based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
