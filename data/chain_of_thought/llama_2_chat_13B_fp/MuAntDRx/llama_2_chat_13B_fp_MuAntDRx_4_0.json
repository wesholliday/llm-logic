This is because the word \"or\" is used to indicate that there are two possible options for the location of the blimple.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the blimple must be either at zooble grazzle or blimple, but we cannot infer that it must be blimple simply based on this statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
