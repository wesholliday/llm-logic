However, it does not directly imply that the wibble must be blimple.\n\nTo infer that the wibble must be blimple, we would need additional information or context that suggests that the wibble is more likely to be blimple than flibbit wozzle. Without such information, we cannot infer that the wibble must be blimple based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
