            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies that the document has been signed in the presence of a notary public, as notarization is a process that verifies the authenticity of a signature. However, it does not necessarily follow that the document must have been signed and notarized.\n\nThere are scenarios where a document may be notarized without being signed. For example, a notary public may sign a document on behalf of the person who is executing the document, if that person is unable to sign themselves. In such cases, the document may be notarized without being signed by the person who is intended to sign it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been signed and notarized solely based on the fact that it must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: No",
