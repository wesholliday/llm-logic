However, it does not necessarily follow that the package was delivered yesterday.\n\nTo infer that the package was delivered yesterday and signed for, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that the package was sent via overnight delivery and the recipient is usually not available during the day, it is possible that the package was delivered yesterday and signed for.\n\nAnswer: No.",
