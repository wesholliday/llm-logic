Therefore, we can infer that the movie was in a language other than the native language of the audience, and that subtitles were provided to facilitate understanding.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the movie was in English and had subtitles. There are many languages other than English that use subtitles, and it is possible that the movie was in one of these languages. Additionally, it is possible that the movie was in English but did not have subtitles, as some English-language movies do not include subtitles.\n\nAnswer: no",
