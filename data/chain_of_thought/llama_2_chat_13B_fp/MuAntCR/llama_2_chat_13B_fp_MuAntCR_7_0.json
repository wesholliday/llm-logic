However, it does not necessarily follow that the exam was difficult. It is possible that the exam was easy and still covered all the chapters.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters based solely on the fact that it covered all chapters.\n\nAnswer: No",
