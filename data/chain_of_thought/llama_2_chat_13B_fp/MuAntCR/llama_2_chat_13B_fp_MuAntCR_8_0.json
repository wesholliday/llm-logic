However, the statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday\" implies that the restaurant was not open on Monday. These two statements are contradictory, as a restaurant cannot be both open and closed on the same day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant must have been closed on Monday and served Italian cuisine.\n\nAnswer: No",
