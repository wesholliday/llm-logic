There could have been empty seats available for purchase at the time of the concert.\n\nHowever, if we were to infer that the concert was sold out, we would need additional information to support that assumption. For example, if we knew that the concert was highly popular and tickets were selling quickly, or if we had information about the attendance of the concert, we might be able to infer that it was sold out.\n\nAnswer: No",
