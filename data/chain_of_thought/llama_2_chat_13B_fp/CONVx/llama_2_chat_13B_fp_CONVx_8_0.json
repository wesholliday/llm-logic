In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, it must also be daggled.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\", we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nIf the sprocket is daggled, it means that it is not functioning properly. Therefore, it is unlikely that the sprocket would be cranked if it is daggled. In fact, the opposite is more likely to be true - if the sprocket is cranked, it is likely to be functioning properly, and therefore it would not be daggled.\n\nAnswer: No",
