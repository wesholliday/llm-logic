This implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nHowever, the reverse statement 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled' is not directly implied by the given statement. There is no logical connection between crinkling and snurgling, so we cannot infer the reverse statement based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
