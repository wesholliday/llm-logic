However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the glip was tragged, it does not necessarily follow that it was slogged.\n\nTo infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\", we would need additional information or context to establish a causal relationship between being tragged and being slogged. Without this additional information, we cannot logically infer the statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
