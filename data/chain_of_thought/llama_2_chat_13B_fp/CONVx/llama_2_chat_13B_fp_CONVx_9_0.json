In other words, if a twonk is plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because a twonk is varnished, it does not necessarily mean that it was plinked. There could be other ways to varnish a twonk that do not involve plinking.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked\" from \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\". The relationship between the two statements is not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: no",
