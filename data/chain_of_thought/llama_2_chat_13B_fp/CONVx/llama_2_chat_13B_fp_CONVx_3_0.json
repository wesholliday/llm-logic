In other words, if something is morphed, it is likely to quank.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\", we need to consider the possibility that there might be other factors that cause quanking besides being morphed. If there are no other factors that cause quanking, then the converse statement would be true.\n\nHowever, if there are other factors that cause quanking, then we cannot infer the converse statement to be true. For example, if quanking can occur due to other factors such as being provoked or experiencing a certain stimulus, then the converse statement would not be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
