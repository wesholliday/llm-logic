In other words, if something is bluttered, it will surn.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\", we need to consider the logical inverse of the original statement. In other words, if we reverse the order of the words in the original statement, we get the converse statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse statement \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\" based on the original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
