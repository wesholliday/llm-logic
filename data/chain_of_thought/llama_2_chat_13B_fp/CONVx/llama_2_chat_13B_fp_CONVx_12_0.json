To infer the converse of this sentence, we need to reverse the condition and consequence.\n\nIn this case, the reverse of 'the smip was shripped' is 'the smip was not shripped', and the reverse of 'the smip lupped the zoint' is 'the smip did not lupped the zoint'. Therefore, the converse of the given sentence 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' is 'If the smip did not lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped'.\n\nAnswer: no",
