In other words, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\", we need to consider the logical implications of the original statement. If the dreb was not vroombed, then it cannot be spened, because there is no direct relationship between the two.\n\nAnswer: no",
