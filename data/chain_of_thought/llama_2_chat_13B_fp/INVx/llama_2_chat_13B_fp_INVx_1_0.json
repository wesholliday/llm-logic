In other words, if the flugel is blimmed, then it must also be zargled.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\", we need to consider the possibility that the flugel may not be blimmed, but still be zargled. If this is the case, then we can infer that the absence of blimming does not necessarily mean the absence of zargling.\n\nAnswer: no",
