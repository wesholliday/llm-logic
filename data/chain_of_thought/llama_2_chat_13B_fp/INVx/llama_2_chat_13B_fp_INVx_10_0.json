This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nNow, to infer the opposite statement, we need to negate the condition. In this case, we negate 'sproinged' to get 'not sproinged'.\n\nSo, the opposite statement of 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is 'If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
