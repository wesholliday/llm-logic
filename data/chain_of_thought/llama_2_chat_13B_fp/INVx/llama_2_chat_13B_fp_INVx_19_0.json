To infer the opposite statement, we need to negate the condition.\n\nSo, the negation of 'the smonk was vreebled' is 'the smonk was not vreebled'. Therefore, the opposite statement of 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' is 'If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
