            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' and see if it logically implies the opposite statement.\n\nThe given statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' implies that if the clug was in a state of being fleeked, then it must also be in a state of being snugged. This implies a causal relationship between being fleeked and being snugged, where being fleeked necessarily leads to being snugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite statement 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged'. This statement is logically equivalent to 'If the clug was not in a state of being fleeked, then it was not in a state of being snugged'. This is true because if the clug was not fleeked, then it cannot be snugged, as the two states are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged' based on the given statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
