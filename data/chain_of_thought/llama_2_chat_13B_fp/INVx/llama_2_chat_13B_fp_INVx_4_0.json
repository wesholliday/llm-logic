This means that if the fribble is snurgled, it will definitely crinkle.\n\nNow, if we negate the first statement, we get 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'. This statement is logically equivalent to 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crinkle'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
