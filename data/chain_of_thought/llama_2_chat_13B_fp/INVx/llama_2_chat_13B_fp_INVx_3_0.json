In other words, if a splat is morphed, it will quank.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\", we need to consider the possibility that a splat may not be morphed but still quank. If this is the case, then we can infer that if a splat is not morphed, it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: no",
