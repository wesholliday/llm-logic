            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\nThe statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, where the condition is 'the wug was flooped' and the consequence is 'the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we can use the principle of logical negation, which states that the negation of a statement is the opposite of the original statement. In this case, the negation of 'the wug was flooped' is 'the wug was not flooped'.\n\nTherefore, the opposite statement of 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' is 'If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
