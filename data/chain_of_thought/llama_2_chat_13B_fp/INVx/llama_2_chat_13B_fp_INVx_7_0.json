In other words, if the whiffle is shanked, it will tink.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\", we need to consider the logical inverse of the original statement.\n\nIf the whiffle is not shanked, then it cannot tink, because the two statements are mutually exclusive. If the whiffle is not shanked, it will not tink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the opposite statement as \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
