In other words, if something is blummed, it must also be zimmed.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\", we need to consider the logical implications of the original statement. If the flug was not blummed, then it cannot be zimmed, because there is no direct relationship between the two.\n\nAnswer: no",
