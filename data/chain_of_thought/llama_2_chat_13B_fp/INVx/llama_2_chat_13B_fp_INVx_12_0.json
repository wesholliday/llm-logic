In this case, we can negate the condition by reversing the word order and changing the word 'shripped' to 'not shripped'.\n\nSo, the negated condition would be 'the smip was not shripped'.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be:\n\nIf the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
