This means that if the zinger is fraggled, then it is smoogled.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we can simply reverse the condition and conclusion. So, if the zinger is not fraggled, then it is not smoogled.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
