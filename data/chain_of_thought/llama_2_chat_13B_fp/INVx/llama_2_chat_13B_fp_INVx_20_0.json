In other words, if a fleeg is bluttered, it will surn. However, the statement does not explicitly state that if a fleeg is not bluttered, it will not surn.\n\nTo infer that if a fleeg was not bluttered, it did not surn, we would need additional information or context. Without this additional information, we cannot logically conclude that if a fleeg was not bluttered, it did not surn.\n\nAnswer: no",
