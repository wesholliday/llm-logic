In other words, if something is plooked, it must also be nugged.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\", we need to consider the logical implications of the original statement. If the shank was not plooked, then it cannot be nugged, because there is no direct relationship between the two.\n\nAnswer: no",
