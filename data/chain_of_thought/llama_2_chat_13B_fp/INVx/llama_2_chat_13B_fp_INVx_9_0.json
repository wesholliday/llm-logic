            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'.\n\nThe statement is in the form of a conditional, where the condition 'the twonk was plinked' is followed by the conclusion 'it was varnished'. This implies that if the condition is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nNow, to infer the opposite statement 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished', we need to negate the condition 'the twonk was plinked'. This gives us 'the twonk was not plinked'.\n\nIf we substitute this negated condition into the original statement, we get:\n\n'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished'\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, since the negation of 'the twonk was plinked' is the same as 'the twonk was not plinked'. Therefore, we can infer 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
