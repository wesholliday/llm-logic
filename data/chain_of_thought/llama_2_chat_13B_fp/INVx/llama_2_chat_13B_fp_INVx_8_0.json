In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, then it is also daggled.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\", we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nIf the sprocket is not cranked, then it cannot be daggled, because the condition \"cranked\" is a necessary precondition for the condition \"dagged\". Therefore, if the sprocket is not cranked, it cannot be daggled, and the statement \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
