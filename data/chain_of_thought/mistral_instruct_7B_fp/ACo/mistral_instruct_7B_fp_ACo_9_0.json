The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. This means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. However, it does not mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. The conditional statement could also mean that even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, Mark still bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
