The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, meaning that if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel. However, this statement does not tell us whether James actually wrote the book or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book was written by James' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
