The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It means that if the car's color is red, then the truck's color is blue. However, it does not mean that the car's color is red. It only tells us a relationship between the two colors.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The car was red' based on the given information."
