The second statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is a conditional statement. This means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, the conditional statement does not necessarily mean that the griffin is in the forest. It only means that if the griffin is, then the unicorn is as well.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The griffin was in the forest' based on the given information."
