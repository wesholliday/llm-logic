The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, the statement does not necessarily mean that Mary was actually at the wedding. It only tells us that if Mary was, then Sue would also be there.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Mary was at the wedding' based on the given information."
