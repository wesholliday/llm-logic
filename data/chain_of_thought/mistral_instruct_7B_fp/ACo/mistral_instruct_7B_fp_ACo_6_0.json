The second statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement that implies that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob will still choose pasta. This does not mean that Sue actually chose pizza, but rather that if she did, Bob would still choose pasta.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'Sue chose pizza'. The conditional statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
