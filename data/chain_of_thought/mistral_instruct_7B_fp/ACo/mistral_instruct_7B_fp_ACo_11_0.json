The second statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would also be blueberry. However, this statement does not provide any information about the actual type of cake. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cake was chocolate' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
