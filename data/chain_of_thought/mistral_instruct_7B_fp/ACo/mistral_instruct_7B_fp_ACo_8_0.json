This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, the statement does not necessarily mean that the vampire is awake. It only means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The vampire was awake' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
