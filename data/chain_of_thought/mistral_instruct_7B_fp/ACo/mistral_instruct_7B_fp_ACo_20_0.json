This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, the given information does not necessarily mean that the apple is red. It only means that if the apple were red, then the banana would be yellow. Without any additional information, we cannot infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that 'The apple was red'."
