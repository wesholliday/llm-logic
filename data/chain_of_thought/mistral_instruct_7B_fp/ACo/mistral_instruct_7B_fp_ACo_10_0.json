This means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, but it does not necessarily mean that the dog is inside. The first statement only tells us that the cat is outside, and the second statement tells us a condition under which the cat is outside, but it does not provide any information about whether the dog is actually inside or not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' based on the given information."
