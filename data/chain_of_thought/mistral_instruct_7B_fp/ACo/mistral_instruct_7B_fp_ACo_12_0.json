The second sentence 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement. It means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy also went to the zoo. However, it does not necessarily mean that Joe actually went to the park. The conditional statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy also went to the zoo. It does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Joe went to the park' based on the given information."
