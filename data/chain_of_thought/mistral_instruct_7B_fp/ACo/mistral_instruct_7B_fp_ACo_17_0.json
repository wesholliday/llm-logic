The second statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is a conditional statement, meaning that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate eats salad. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Ben actually ate pasta. It only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Ben ate pasta' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
