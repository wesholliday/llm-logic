The second statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement that suggests a relationship between Sam's and Erin's modes of transportation. It states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, it does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. The conditional statement only tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not provide any information about whether or not Sam actually took a plane.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Sam took a plane' based on the given information."
