The second statement is an if-then statement: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nTo infer 'The shirt was cotton', we would need to know that the pants being denim implies that the shirt is cotton. However, the second statement only tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would also be denim. It does not tell us that the shirt is actually cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shirt was cotton' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
