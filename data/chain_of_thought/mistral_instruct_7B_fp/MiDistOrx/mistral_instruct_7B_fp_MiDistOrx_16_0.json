Therefore, the inference 'The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble' is redundant and does not provide any new information.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble' from 'The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or flump wibble'."
