However, the phrase 'might be' is used to indicate a possibility, and it can be rephrased in various ways without changing the meaning. Therefore, 'The froodle might be flump or it might be fribble' is a valid rephrasing of the original statement, as it also suggests that the froodle has two possible identities: flump or fribble.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
