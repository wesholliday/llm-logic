However, the phrase 'or' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses, indicating that both possibilities are equally likely.\n\nTo infer 'The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle', we would need to rephrase the original statement to explicitly state that both possibilities are equally likely. However, since the original statement already implies this, there is no need to make an inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle' from the original statement, as the original statement already implies this."
