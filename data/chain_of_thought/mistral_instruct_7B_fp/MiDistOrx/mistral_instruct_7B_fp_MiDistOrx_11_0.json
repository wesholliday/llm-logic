            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The frazzle might be blurble or blurble might be grooble' is a grammatically ambiguous sentence. It could mean that the frazzle and blurble are interchangeable, or it could mean that the frazzle has the potential to be either blurble or grooble. However, if we want to make the sentence clearer and more straightforward, we can separate the two possibilities by saying 'The frazzle might be blurble or it might be grooble'. This means that the frazzle has two distinct possibilities: it could be blurble, or it could be grooble.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
