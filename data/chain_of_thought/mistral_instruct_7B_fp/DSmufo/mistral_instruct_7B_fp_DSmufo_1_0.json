This statement does not exclude the possibility that Fido could be inside the house.\n\nThe second statement 'Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true. However, the first statement already tells us that Fido is not required to be in the garden, so the only remaining option is that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
