This leaves open the possibility that the watch could be charging on the dresser.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, the only remaining option is that 'it is charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
