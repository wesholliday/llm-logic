This leaves open the possibility that the scarf could be somewhere else, such as in your backpack.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack' is a disjunction, meaning that either one or the other of the two conditions must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the scarf is not necessarily on the coat rack, the only other option left is that it is in your backpack.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
