'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' means that the milk is not necessarily chilling in the fridge. It could be somewhere else, like on the counter.\n2. 'Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter' is a disjunction, meaning that either one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that the milk is not necessarily chilling in the fridge, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is on the counter.\n2. The second statement tells us that either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. Since we know from the first statement that the milk is not necessarily chilling in the fridge, the only other option left is that it is on the counter.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
