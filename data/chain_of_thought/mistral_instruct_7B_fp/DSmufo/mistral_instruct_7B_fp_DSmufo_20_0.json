The second statement 'Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining option is that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
