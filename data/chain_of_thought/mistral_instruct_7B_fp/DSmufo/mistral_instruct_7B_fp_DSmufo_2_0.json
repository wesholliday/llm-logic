However, the first statement already tells us that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\nSo, even though the second statement suggests that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based on this information, because we know that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
