            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe first statement 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' means that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, but they could be somewhere else. The second statement 'Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer' is a disjunction, meaning that either one of the two conditions must be true. However, the first statement contradicts the second statement if we interpret 'must be dangling in the cabinet' as an absolute necessity.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can interpret the second statement as 'Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are located elsewhere (not dangling in the cabinet and not in the drawer)'. Since we know from the first statement that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, the second statement reduces to 'The keys are located elsewhere (not in the cabinet)'.\n\nNow, the only other location mentioned in the problem is the drawer. Therefore, the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
