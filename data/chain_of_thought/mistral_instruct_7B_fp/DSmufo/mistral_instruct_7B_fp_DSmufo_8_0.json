The second statement 'Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table' means that there are only two possibilities: the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. Since we know that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch, the only remaining possibility is that it is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
