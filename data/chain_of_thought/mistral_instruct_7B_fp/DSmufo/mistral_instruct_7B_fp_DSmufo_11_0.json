However, it does not rule out the possibility that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that the first condition is not necessarily true (the newspaper is not required to be on the porch), then the second condition must be true, which means that the newspaper must be in the driveway or it must be on the porch.\n\nHowever, since we have already established that the newspaper is not on the porch, then the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
