The two conditions are 'The cookies must be hidden in the pantry' and 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nSince we know that the first condition is not true (the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry), the only remaining option is the second condition: 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
