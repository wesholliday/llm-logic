The second statement 'Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer' means that the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer, and there is no other option.\n\nSince we know that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand (from the first statement), and we also know that it must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer (from the second statement), it follows that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
