It could be anywhere else, including in your bag.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag' is a disjunction, meaning it states that at least one of the two conditions must be true. In this case, it means either the pen must be on the desk, or it is in your bag.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the pen is not necessarily on the desk, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the pen is in your bag.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
