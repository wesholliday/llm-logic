However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint, even if it was flooped.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer 'The wug was not flooped'. The reason is that the second statement does not negate the first statement. It only introduces a possibility that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint, even if it was flooped. Therefore, it does not mean that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
