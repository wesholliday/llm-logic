            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement, meaning if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. The second statement 'The sprocket might not have been daggled' is a statement of possibility, meaning it is not necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements allows us to infer that the sprocket was not cranked. The first statement only tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. The second statement tells us that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled, but it does not tell us anything about whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' based on the given information."
