However, the second premise introduces a possibility that the smonk might not have plagged, even if it was vreebled. This means that the smonk being vreebled does not necessarily mean that it plagged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
