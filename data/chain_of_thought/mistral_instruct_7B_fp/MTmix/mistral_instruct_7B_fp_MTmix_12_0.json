The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning if the smip is shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint. The second statement is a possibility, meaning the smip might not have lupped the zoint, but it does not necessarily mean that the smip was not shripped. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The smip was not shripped'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
