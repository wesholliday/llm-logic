However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the dreb might not have been spened, even if it was vroombed. This means that the conditional statement does not hold true in all cases.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
