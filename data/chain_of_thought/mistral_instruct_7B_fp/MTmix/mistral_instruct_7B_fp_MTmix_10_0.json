            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled' is a conditional statement, meaning if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, the second statement 'It might not have been garpled' introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. This means that even though the wug was sproonged, it might not have been garpled as well. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was not sproonged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
