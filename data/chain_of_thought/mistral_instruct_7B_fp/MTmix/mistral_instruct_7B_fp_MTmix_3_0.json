            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked' is a conditional statement, meaning if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. The second statement 'The splat might not have quanked' is a statement of possibility, meaning there is a chance that the splat did not quank.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements directly contradict each other or the first statement. The first statement is a necessary condition, but the second statement does not necessarily mean that the necessary condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' based on 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked' and 'The splat might not have quanked'."
