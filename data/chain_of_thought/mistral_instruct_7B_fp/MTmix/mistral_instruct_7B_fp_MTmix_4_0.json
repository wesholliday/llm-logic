The statement 'The fribble might not have crinked' suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble did not crink, even if it was snurgled.\nHowever, neither of these statements directly or indirectly suggests that the fribble was not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
