The second statement 'The flug might not have been zimmed' suggests that there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed, even if it was blummed.\nHowever, neither of these statements directly or indirectly suggests that the flug was not blummed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not blummed' based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
