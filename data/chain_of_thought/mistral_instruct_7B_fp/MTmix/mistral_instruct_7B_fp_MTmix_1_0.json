However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the flugel might not have been zargled, even if it was blimmed. This means that the condition in the first statement is not always true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
