            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned' is a conditional statement, meaning if the fleeg is bluttered, then it must be surned. The second statement 'It might not have been surned' suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned, even if it was bluttered. However, the first statement does not allow for the possibility of the fleeg being bluttered and not surned. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
