However, the second statement 'The twonk might not have been varnished' introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. This means that the twonk could have been plinked without being varnished. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
