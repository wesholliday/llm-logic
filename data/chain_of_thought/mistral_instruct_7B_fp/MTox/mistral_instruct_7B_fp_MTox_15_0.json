The second statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the dreb is vroombed (whatever 'vroombed' means in this context), then the dreb will be spent.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to infer that the dreb was not vroombed. The first statement only tells us that the dreb was not spent, but it does not tell us whether the dreb was vroombed or not. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' based on the given statements."
