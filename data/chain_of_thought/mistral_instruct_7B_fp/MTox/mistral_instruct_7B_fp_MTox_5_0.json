It means that if the zinger was 'fraggled', then it must have been 'smoogled' first. 'Fraggled' is another way of putting the zinger together, let's say in a different manner.\n\nHowever, the statement does not imply that the zinger was actually 'fraggled'. It only states that if it was, then it must have been 'smoogled' first. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
