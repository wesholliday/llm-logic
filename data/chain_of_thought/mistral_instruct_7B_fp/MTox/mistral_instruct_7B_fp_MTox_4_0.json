The first statement is 'The fribble did not crink' together.\n2. The second statement is 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can see that the first statement contradicts the 'if' part of the second statement. The 'if' part of the second statement implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would crink. However, the first statement tells us that the fribble did not crink.\n\nSince the first statement contradicts the 'if' part of the second statement, it means that the condition in the 'if' part (the fribble being snurgled) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
