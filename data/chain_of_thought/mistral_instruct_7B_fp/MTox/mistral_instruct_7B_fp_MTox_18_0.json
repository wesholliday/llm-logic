However, without knowing the exact meaning of 'plooked' and 'nugged', we cannot make any definitive conclusions.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine the meaning of 'plooked' and 'nugged', we cannot infer 'The shank was not plooked' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The shank was not plooked' based on the given statements."
