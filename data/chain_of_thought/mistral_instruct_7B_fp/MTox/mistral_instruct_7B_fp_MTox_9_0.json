The second statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' is a conditional statement that suggests that if the twonk is plinked (whatever that means in this context), then it must have been varnished before that. However, the statement does not imply that the twonk was plinked in the first place. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
