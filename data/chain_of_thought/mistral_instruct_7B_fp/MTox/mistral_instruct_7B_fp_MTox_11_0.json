The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the flug was blummed, then it would also be zimmed.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about whether the flug was blummed or not. It only tells us that if it was, then it would also be zimmed.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the flug was not zimmed, and the second statement does not contradict this, we cannot infer that the flug was not blummed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
