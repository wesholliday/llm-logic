However, the second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement that suggests that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would be in the state of being daggled. This does not mean that the sprocket was actually cranked and daggled, but rather that if it were cranked, it would be daggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
