It means that if the glip is in a state of being 'slogged', then it is also in a state of being 'tragged'.\n\nHowever, the fact that the glip is not 'tragged' does not necessarily mean that it is not 'slogged'. The conditional statement only tells us that if the glip is 'slogged', then it is also 'tragged'. It does not tell us that if the glip is not 'tragged', then it is not 'slogged'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
