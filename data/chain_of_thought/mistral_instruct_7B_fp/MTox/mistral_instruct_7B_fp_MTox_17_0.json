The first statement is 'The flob did not movated'. This means that the flob did not move at all.\n2. The second statement is 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'. This means that if the flob was skizzled, then it would move.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the flob was skizzled. If it was, then according to the second statement, it would move. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the flob did not move at all. Therefore, it is not possible for the flob to be skizzled based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer that 'The flob was not skizzled'."
