The second statement gives us a conditional rule: if the splat was morphed, then it would quank.\n\nHowever, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer that the splat was not morphed. The statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the splat was never morphed. Therefore, we cannot draw a definitive conclusion about the splat's morphing status based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given statements."
