The first statement tells us that the wug was not garpled at some point. The second statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. However, this statement does not tell us anything about the current state of the wug or if it has ever been sproonged in the past. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was not sproonged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
