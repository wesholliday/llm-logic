'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'\n\nThe first statement tells us that the fleeg did not 'surn' (whatever that means in this context). The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the fleeg was 'bluttered', then it would 'surn'.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' based on these two statements. The reason is that the second statement is a conditional statement, and it only tells us what would happen if the fleeg was 'bluttered'. It does not tell us whether the fleeg was actually 'bluttered' or not. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive statement about the fleeg's state of 'blutteredness' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' based on the given statements."
