The first statement only tells us that the whiffle did not make the sound 'tink' when it was hit, but it does not necessarily mean that the whiffle was not shanked. The second statement tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it would make the sound 'tink', but it does not mean that the whiffle was shanked because it did not make the sound 'tink'. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about whether the whiffle was shanked or not based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
