It means that if the grommet was in a state of being sploffed, then the grommet would have plopped the frink.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides information about the current or past state of the grommet being sploffed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
