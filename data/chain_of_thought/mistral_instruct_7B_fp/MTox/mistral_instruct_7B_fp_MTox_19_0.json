'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'\n\nThe first statement tells us that the smonk did not plagiarize (plagged is misspelled, but we can infer that it means 'plagiarized').\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it tells us that if the smonk was vreebled (again, we can infer that it means 'vulnerable' or 'weakened'), then the smonk would plagiarize.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled based on these two statements. The first statement only tells us that the smonk did not plagiarize, and the second statement tells us that if the smonk was vreebled, then it would plagiarize. It does not tell us that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' based on the given statements."
