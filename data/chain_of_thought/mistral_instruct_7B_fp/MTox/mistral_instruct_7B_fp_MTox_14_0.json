This means that the clug was not in a state of being snugged together.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'. This means that if the clug was in a state of being fleeked, then it would also be in a state of being snugged together.\n\nHowever, we do not have any information about the state of the clug being fleeked. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. We cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked' based on the given information."
