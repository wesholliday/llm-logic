This means that the presence of the bear in the cave is a sufficient condition for the wolf to be in the den.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the wolf was in the den. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave. The first statement only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. It does not say that the presence of the wolf in the den implies that the bear is in the cave.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
