The second statement is \"Kate ate salad.\" This means that Kate has indeed eaten salad.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily mean that Ben has eaten pasta. The 'if' statement only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not mean that Ben has actually eaten pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
