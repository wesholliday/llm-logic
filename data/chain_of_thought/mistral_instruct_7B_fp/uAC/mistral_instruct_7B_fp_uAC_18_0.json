The second statement given is \"The truck was metal.\" This means that the truck actually is made of metal.\n\nNow, we need to see if this information allows us to infer that the doll is plastic. According to the first statement, if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. But we know from the second statement that the truck is metal. So, if the first statement were true, then the doll would also have to be plastic. However, the first statement is not a guarantee, but rather a conditional statement. It does not mean that the doll must be plastic, only that if it is, then the truck must be metal.\n\nSince we cannot definitively say that the doll is plastic based on the given information, we cannot infer that it is.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic."
