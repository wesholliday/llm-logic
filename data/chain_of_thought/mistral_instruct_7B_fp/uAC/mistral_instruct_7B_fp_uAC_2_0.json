This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (griffin in the forest) is true, then the second part (unicorn in the forest) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the unicorn is indeed in the forest. This means that at least one of the conditions for the first statement to be true has been met.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us that if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin must also be in the forest. It only tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, while we know that the unicorn is in the forest, we cannot infer with certainty that the griffin is also in the forest based on the information given.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the griffin was in the forest."
