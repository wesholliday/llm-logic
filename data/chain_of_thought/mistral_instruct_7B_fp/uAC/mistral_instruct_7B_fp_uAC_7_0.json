However, the first statement is a conditional statement, and we cannot assume that the condition (Alex finished the race) is true unless we have evidence to support it.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Chris finished the race, but it does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race as well. The first statement is a 'if-then' statement, and the 'if' part is not confirmed in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race with certainty.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race."
