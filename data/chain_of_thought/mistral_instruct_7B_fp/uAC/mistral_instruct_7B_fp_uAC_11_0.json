The fact that the muffins are blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake is chocolate. The first statement is a conditional statement, and it only becomes true if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is also true. But we have no information that the cake is chocolate, so we cannot infer that it is.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate."
