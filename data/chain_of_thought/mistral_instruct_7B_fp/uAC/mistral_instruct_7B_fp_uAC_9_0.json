The second statement tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Lisa buying the red shirt) occurs, then another event (Mark buying the blue shirt) occurs. However, the second statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the first event (Lisa buying the red shirt) actually occurred. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
