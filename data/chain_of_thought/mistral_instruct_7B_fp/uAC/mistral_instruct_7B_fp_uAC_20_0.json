            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. The second statement is \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement tells us that the banana actually is yellow.\n\nNow, we need to see if the first condition (the apple being red) is also true. If it is, then the whole conditional statement is true. If it's not, the conditional statement is still true, but the first part (the apple being red) is not.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Since we know that the banana was yellow, and the conditional statement says that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, it follows that the apple must have been red. This is because the second part of the conditional statement (the banana being yellow) is true, and the conditional statement is of the form \"If P, then Q.\" If Q is true, then P must also be true."
