Since we know that Amy played tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball, but it does mean that if Jeff played basketball, then the condition that Amy played tennis would be met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
