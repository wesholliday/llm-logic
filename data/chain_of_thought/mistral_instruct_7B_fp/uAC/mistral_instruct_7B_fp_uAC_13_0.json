            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. The second statement given is \"The truck was blue.\" This statement confirms that the truck is blue, which is consistent with the first statement's condition. However, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the car is red. It only means that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. But we have no information about the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the car was red."
