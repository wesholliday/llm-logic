However, this statement does not imply that other factors, such as physical exertion, do not also play a role in causing tiredness. Therefore, while getting enough sleep may help prevent tiredness, it does not necessarily mean that doing hard labor while getting enough sleep will also prevent tiredness.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired."
