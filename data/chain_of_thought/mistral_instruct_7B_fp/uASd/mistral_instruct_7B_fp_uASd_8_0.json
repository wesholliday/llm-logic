However, if the package is misrouted, it means that it has been sent to the wrong destination. In this case, the package will not arrive at its intended destination on the expected delivery date, even if it was originally shipped on that day. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\n\nAnswer: No."
