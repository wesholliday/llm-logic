            "content": "Explanation: Changing the oil in a car can help improve its performance and prevent engine damage by keeping the engine lubricated. However, if the transmission is shot, it means that the transmission system is not functioning properly, which can cause the car to not shift gears properly or not move at all. Therefore, changing the oil will not fix a shot transmission and the car will not run smoothly.\n\nAnswer: No, changing the oil will not make a car run smoothly if the transmission is shot."
