            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence 'The wibble must be quork by frazzle and gribble' contains two parts connected by 'and'. The first part is 'The wibble must be quork by frazzle', and the second part is 'and gribble'. To infer if the first part can be inferred from the whole sentence, we need to check if the second part provides any additional information that changes the meaning of the first part.\n\nIn this case, the second part 'and gribble' does not seem to change the meaning of the first part 'The wibble must be quork by frazzle'. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The wibble must be quork by frazzle' can be inferred from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
