However, the phrase does not necessarily mean that 'zazzle' must exist at both places simultaneously or to the same extent. If we want to infer that 'zazzle' must be at 'plimp grooble', we would need additional context or information to support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The zazzle must be at plimp grooble'."
