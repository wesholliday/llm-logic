However, it does not specify if 'and' means that both blurble and snizzle must occur at the same time or if they are two separate requirements.\n\nSince we cannot infer from this sentence that 'blurble' is a requirement that does not need to be met at the same time as 'snizzle', we cannot definitively say that 'The flibbit must be blurble'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
