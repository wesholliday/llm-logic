This means that if the krimp is present in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer 'If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked'. This new statement adds an additional condition that the zool is zapped.\n\nTo infer whether the new statement is true or false, we need to consider if the additional condition (zool being zapped) affects the original condition (krimp being in the zool leading to snarf being glonked).\n\nIn this case, without more information, it is not possible to definitively say whether the zool being zapped affects the krimp being in the zool and the snarf being glonked. Therefore, we cannot infer the truth or falsity of the new statement based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer whether 'If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked' is true or false based on the given information."
