It means that if the condition 'the glop is on the brink' is true, then the consequence 'the skrizzle is plonked' must also be true.\n\nHowever, the new statement 'If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked' is a different conditional statement. It adds an additional condition 'and the bloop is zorped' to the original condition 'the glop is on the brink'.\n\nTo infer whether this new statement is true or not, we need to know the relationship between 'the glop is on the brink', 'the bloop is zorped', and 'the skrizzle is plonked'. Without this information, it is not possible to make a definitive answer.\n\nAnswer:\nI cannot answer 'yes' or 'no' without more information."
