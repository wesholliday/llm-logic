It means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nThe second statement, 'The book is a mystery novel', is a fact that we know to be true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the first statement does not necessarily mean that the book was actually written by James. It only means that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel. But there could be other authors who also write mystery novels. Therefore, the truth of 'The book is a mystery novel' does not necessarily imply that 'The book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The book was written by James' is true."
