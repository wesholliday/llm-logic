This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nNow, we want to know if 'Joe went to the park' is true. Since we know that 'Lucy went to the zoo', we can check if this satisfies the condition in the first statement. If it does, then 'Joe went to the park' must also be true.\n\nSo, does 'Lucy went to the zoo' satisfying the condition 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' mean that 'Joe went to the park' is true?\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
