This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Kate ate salad'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the first part (Ben ate pasta) must also be true. In other words, we need to check if the condition for the first statement to be true is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively say that 'Ben ate pasta' is true. The given statements only tell us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and that Kate ate salad. They do not provide any information about Ben eating pasta. Therefore, while it is possible that Ben ate pasta, it is also possible that he did not. So, 'Ben ate pasta' is not necessarily true.\n\nFinal answer: No, it does not necessarily follow that 'Ben ate pasta' is true."
