            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This means that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion we want to draw: 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nGiven that the second statement is true (Sue was at the wedding), and the first statement is a conditional statement that says 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we can infer that Mary must have also been at the wedding. This is because the condition in the first statement (Mary was at the wedding) has been met, and the second part of the condition (Sue was at the wedding) is also true. Therefore, the entire conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
