This is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then another event (Erin taking a train) also occurs. The second statement given is 'Erin took a train'.\n\nTo determine if 'Sam took a plane' is true, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. Since 'Erin took a train' is true, and according to the first statement, 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', it follows that Sam must have taken a plane as well.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
