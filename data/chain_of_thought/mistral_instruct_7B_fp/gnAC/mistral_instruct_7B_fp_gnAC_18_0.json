            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (truck being metal) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The truck was metal'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true. However, the truth of the first part (doll being plastic) is not given or implied. Therefore, even though the truck being metal follows from the doll being plastic, it does not mean that the doll being plastic is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The doll was plastic' is true."
