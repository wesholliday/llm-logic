This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nTo determine if 'Sue chose pizza' is true, we need to consider both statements together. Since 'Bob chose pasta' is true, and we know that 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', it means that Sue must have chosen pizza as well, because the only way Bob could have chosen pasta is if Sue chose pizza first.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
