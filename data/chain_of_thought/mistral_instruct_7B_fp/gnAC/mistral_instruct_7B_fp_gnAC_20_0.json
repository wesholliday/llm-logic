            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The banana was yellow'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true. However, the truth of the first part (the apple being red) is not explicitly stated or proven. Therefore, even though the banana being yellow follows from the apple being red, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The apple was red'."
