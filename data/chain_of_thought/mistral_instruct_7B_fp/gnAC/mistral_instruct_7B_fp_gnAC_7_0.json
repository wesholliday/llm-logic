This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Alex finished the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finished the race) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Chris finished the race is true'. This means that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement again. It says that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. Since we know that Chris finished the race, according to the conditional statement, it must also be true that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
