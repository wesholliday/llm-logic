            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nTo determine if it necessarily follows that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true, we need to consider the given information and the structure of the conditional statement. Since 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is true, according to the conditional statement, it means that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' must also be true. However, the given information does not necessarily mean that Lisa actually bought the red shirt. It only means that if she did, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, while it is logically possible that Lisa bought the red shirt, the given information does not provide enough evidence to conclude that she did.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true."
