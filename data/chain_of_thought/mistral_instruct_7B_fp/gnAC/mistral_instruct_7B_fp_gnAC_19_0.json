            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Jen watched basketball'. This means that Jen did watch basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football. The conditional statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. It does not say that Tom actually watched football. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Tom watched football' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Tom watched football' is true."
