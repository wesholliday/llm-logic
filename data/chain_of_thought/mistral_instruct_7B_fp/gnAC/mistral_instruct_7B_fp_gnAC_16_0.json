            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The pants were denim'. This means that the pants meet the condition in the first statement, so if the shirt being cotton is the condition for the pants being denim, then it must also be true.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the given information does not necessarily mean that the shirt is actually cotton. The conditional statement only tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. It does not tell us that the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The shirt was cotton' is true based on the given information. While it is possible that the shirt is cotton, the given information does not provide enough evidence to make that conclusion."
