The second statement 'The truck was blue' is a fact that the truck actually is blue.\n\nHowever, the truth of the first statement does not necessarily mean that the car is red. The truth of the first statement only guarantees that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. But it does not say anything about the color of the car itself.\n\nSo, even though the truck is blue, it does not mean that the car must be red. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that 'The car was red'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
