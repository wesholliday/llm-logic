The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequence (unicorn being in the forest) is also true. The second statement is a fact that the unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\nTo determine if 'The griffin was in the forest' is true, we need to check if the condition in the first statement is also true. Since the consequence of the first statement is true (unicorn is in the forest), it implies that the condition must also be true (griffin must be in the forest).\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
