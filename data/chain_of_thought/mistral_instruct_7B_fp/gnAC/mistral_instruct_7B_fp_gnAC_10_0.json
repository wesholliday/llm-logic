This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the dog being inside) is true, then the second part (the cat being outside) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of this statement is 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside', which is not necessarily true.\n\nThe second given statement is 'The cat was outside'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, just because the second part of the conditional statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that the first part is also true. The truth of the first part (the dog being inside) depends on the specific situation.\n\nTherefore, even though 'The cat was outside' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'The dog was inside' is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
