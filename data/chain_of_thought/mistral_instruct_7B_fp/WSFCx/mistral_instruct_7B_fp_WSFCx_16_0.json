It means that either 'The blurble might wobble' or 'it might floob the grazzle', or both could happen. The phrase 'or' indicates that these are separate possibilities, but they are not necessarily exclusive. Therefore, 'The blurble might wobble and it might floob the grazzle' is a valid interpretation, as it includes both possibilities.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
