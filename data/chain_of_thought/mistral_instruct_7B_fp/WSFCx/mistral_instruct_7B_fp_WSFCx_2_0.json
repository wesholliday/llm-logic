The word 'or' indicates that either one of these possibilities can occur, but not necessarily both. However, in the question, it is being asked if both possibilities can occur. Therefore, based on the given sentence, we cannot infer that 'The fizzle might snork the flibbit and it might grazzle to the bimboozle' is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: No."
