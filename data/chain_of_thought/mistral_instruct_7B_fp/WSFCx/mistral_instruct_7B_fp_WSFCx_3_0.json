However, the statement does not specify that the plonk must be in both places.\n\nTo infer 'The plonk might be on the zibble and it might be in the snork', we would need additional information or context to suggest that the plonk must be in both locations. Without such information, we cannot make this inference based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The plonk might be on the zibble and it might be in the snork' based on the original statement 'The plonk might be on the zibble or it might be in the snork'."
