This means that both possibilities are being considered. If we want to say that both possibilities are being considered, we can simply repeat the statement as 'The zump might be zooble quibble and it might be blurble'. Therefore, yes, we can infer 'The zump might be zooble quibble and it might be blurble' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
