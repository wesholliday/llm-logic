This statement is expressing a possibility, not an exclusivity. Therefore, it is logically consistent with the statement 'The blurble might be a crunk and it might be a flibbit'. In fact, the second statement is a more explicit way of expressing the first, as it includes both possibilities in a single sentence.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
