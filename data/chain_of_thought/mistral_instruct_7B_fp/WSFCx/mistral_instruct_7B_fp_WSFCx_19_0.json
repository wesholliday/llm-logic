However, the sentence does not specify whether these two actions can occur simultaneously or not. To infer 'The wump might blurble grazzle and it might flibbit snork', we would need additional information indicating that the wump can perform both actions at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The wump might blurble grazzle and it might flibbit snork' based on the given information."
