The second statement 'Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag' is a disjunction, meaning that the pen can be either on the desk or in the bag, but not both at the same time and not neither. Since we know that the pen is not on the desk, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
