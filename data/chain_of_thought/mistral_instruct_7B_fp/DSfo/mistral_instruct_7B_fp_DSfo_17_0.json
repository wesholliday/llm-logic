The second statement 'Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack' is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two mutually exclusive options. Since we know that the scarf is not on the coat rack, the only remaining option is 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
