The second statement 'Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer' is a disjunction, meaning that the keys can be in one of the two places, but not both at the same time. Since we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, it means that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
