The second statement 'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, meaning that Fido must be either in the garden or inside the house (or possibly somewhere else, but the statement only provides two options). Since we know that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
