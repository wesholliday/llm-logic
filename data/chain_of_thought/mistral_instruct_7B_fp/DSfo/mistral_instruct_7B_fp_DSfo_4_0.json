If the first option is not true, then the second option must be true.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not rule out the second option. It only states that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. It does not provide any information about where the cat might be. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cat is napping on the couch' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
