The second statement 'Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room' is a disjunction, meaning it can be either one or the other, but not both. Since we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, the only other option left is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
