The second statement 'Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car' is a disjunction, meaning that the umbrella is either in the closet or in the car, but not both at the same time. Since we know that the umbrella is not in the closet, the only other option is that it is in the car.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
