This does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf, it could be on the floor, on a chair, or in someone's hand, for example.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two mutually exclusive options. However, the first statement does not exclude the second option, it only states that the book is not on the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
