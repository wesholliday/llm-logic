            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, does the truth of the conclusion have to be true as well?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (Premise 1)\n2. The shirt was cotton. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the pants were denim. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) followed by an application of that conditional statement. To check if the conclusion logically follows, we can substitute the values from the premises into the conditional statement and see if the conclusion holds true.\n\nSubstituting the values from the premises into the conditional statement, we get:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The shirt was cotton.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows:\n3. Therefore, the pants were denim.\n\nSince the shirt is cotton (as stated in Premise 2), and if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (as stated in Premise 1), then it logically follows that the pants must be denim.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
