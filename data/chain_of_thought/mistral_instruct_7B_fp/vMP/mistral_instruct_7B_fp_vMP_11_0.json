            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (Premise 1)\n2. The cake was chocolate (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the muffins were blueberry (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (Premise 1) and an instance of that condition (Premise 2), which leads to the conclusion.\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we can substitute the condition in the first premise with the instance from the second premise and see if the conclusion still holds.\n\nSubstituting 'The cake was chocolate' for 'If the cake was chocolate' in Premise 1, we get:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\n2. The cake was chocolate\n3. Therefore, the muffins were blueberry\n\nSince the conclusion 'The muffins were blueberry' follows logically from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
