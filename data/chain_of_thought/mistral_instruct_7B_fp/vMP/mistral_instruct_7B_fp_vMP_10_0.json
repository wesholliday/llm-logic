In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (Premise 1)\n2. The dog was inside (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the cat was outside (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) followed by an application of that conditional statement.\n\nExamining the argument, we can see that if the first premise is true (if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside), and the second premise is also true (the dog was inside), then the conclusion must be true (the cat was outside). This is because the second premise is an instance of the condition in the first premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
