            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the first premise is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. The second premise is 'Jeff played basketball'. The conclusion is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, it must be the case that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, the truth of the premises must logically entail the truth of the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy played tennis) must also be true. The second premise asserts that the condition is true (Jeff played basketball).\n\nTherefore, if the argument is logically valid, then the truth of the second premise (Jeff played basketball) must logically entail the truth of the conclusion (Amy played tennis).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nThe truth of the second premise (Jeff played basketball) does logically entail the truth of the conclusion (Amy played tennis), given the first premise (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis). This is because the second premise makes the condition of the first premise true, and the first premise asserts that if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, the truth of the condition and the truth of the consequence being logically entailed by the condition together make the argument logically valid."
