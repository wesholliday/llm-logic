            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (Premise 1)\n2. The apple was red (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the banana was yellow (Conclusion)\n\nThe form of this argument is a conditional statement followed by an instance of that condition, and then the conclusion is drawn from the instance. This is known as a \"modus ponens\" argument.\n\nIn a \"modus ponens\" argument, if the conditional statement (if P then Q) is true and the instance of the condition (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.\n\nSo, to check if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if Premise 1 is a true conditional statement and if Premise 2 is true.\n\n1. Is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' a true conditional statement? This is a matter of fact, and whether it's true or false depends on the specific context. If in this specific context, whenever the apple is red, the banana is yellow, then this is a true conditional statement. But if there are exceptions, then it's not a true conditional statement.\n\n2. Is 'The apple was red' true? Again, this is a matter of fact. If in this specific context, the apple was indeed red, then this premise is true.\n\nIf both Premise 1 and Premise 2 are true, then the conclusion 'The banana was yellow' must also be true, according to the \"modus ponens\" rule.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe validity of this argument depends on the truth of the premises, specifically Premise 1 being a true conditional statement and Premise 2 being true. Without knowing the specific context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this argument is logically valid or not."
