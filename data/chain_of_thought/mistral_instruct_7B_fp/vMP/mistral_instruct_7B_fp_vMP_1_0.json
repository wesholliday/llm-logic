            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise is a statement that the condition is true: 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nIf both premises are true, then the condition in the first premise is true, and therefore, according to the conditional statement, the consequence must also be true. So, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, if the argument is to be logically valid, the conclusion 'Sue was at the wedding' must follow logically from the premises. And since it does, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
