            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Premise 1)\n2. Sam took a plane. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Erin took a train. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) followed by an application of the if-then statement.\n\nExamining the argument, we can see that the conclusion 'Erin took a train' is a direct application of the first premise 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'. If the first premise is true, and the second premise 'Sam took a plane' is also true, then the conclusion 'Erin took a train' must be true as well.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
