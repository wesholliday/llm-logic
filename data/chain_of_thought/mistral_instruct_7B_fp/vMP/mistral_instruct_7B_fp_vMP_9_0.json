            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1)\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt (Conclusion)\n\nExplanation of Premise 1:\nThis premise is a conditional statement, meaning it has an 'if-then' structure. It states that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt.\n\nExplanation of Premise 2:\nThis premise states that Lisa actually bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt (Premise 2), then, according to Premise 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, the conclusion 'Mark bought the blue shirt' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
