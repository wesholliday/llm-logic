            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n2. The doll was plastic. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the truck was metal. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) followed by an application of that conditional statement.\n\nExamining the argument, we see that Premise 1 is a conditional statement, and Premise 2 is an instance of the antecedent (the 'if' part) of that conditional statement. If the doll being plastic makes it true that the truck is metal, and the doll is indeed plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
