In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\n2. The book was written by James (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book is a mystery novel (Conclusion)\n\nExamining the argument, we can see that if Premise 1 is true (i.e., if writing the book by James implies that it's a mystery novel), and Premise 2 is also true (i.e., if James indeed wrote the book), then the conclusion must be true (i.e., the book is a mystery novel).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
