            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. (Premise 1)\n2. Ben ate pasta. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Kate ate salad. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the first premise is a conditional statement itself. To check if the conclusion follows logically, we can substitute the value of the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) into the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. (Substitute Ben ate pasta into the first premise)\n\nNow, since the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, according to the conditional statement, the consequent (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
