            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement followed by an instance of that condition, and then a conclusion that draws a conclusion based on the condition. In formal logic, this type of argument is known as a modus ponens argument. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be the case that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement that says 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. The second premise is an instance of the condition, saying 'The griffin was in the forest'. If the second premise is true, then according to the conditional statement, the unicorn must also be in the forest. Therefore, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
