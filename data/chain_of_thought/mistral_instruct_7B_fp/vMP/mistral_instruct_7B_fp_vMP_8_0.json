In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and its consequent (the mummy was awake). The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. The second premise states that the vampire was awake.\n\nIf the second premise is true (the vampire was awake), then according to the first premise, the mummy must also be awake. Therefore, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
