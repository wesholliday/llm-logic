            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of modus ponens, which is a type of deductive argument that has the following structure: If P then Q, P, therefore Q. In this case, the first premise is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', the second premise is 'Alex finished the race', and the conclusion is 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finished the race) must also be true. The second premise states that the condition is true (Alex finished the race). Therefore, if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
