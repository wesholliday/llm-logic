In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (Premise 1)\n2. Sue chose pizza (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Bob chose pasta (Conclusion)\n\nThe form of this argument is a conditional statement followed by an instance of that condition, and then the conclusion drawn from that instance. This is known as a modus ponens argument.\n\nIn a modus ponens argument, if the conditional statement (if P then Q) is true and the instance of the condition (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.\n\nSo, to check if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion 'Bob chose pasta' follows logically from the premises.\n\nGiven that Premise 1 is a conditional statement and Premise 2 is an instance of that condition, if Premise 2 is true (Sue chose pizza), then according to Premise 1, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
