In formal logic, this type of argument is known as a \"double negation\" argument.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'The vampire might not have been awake', which is equivalent to 'It's not the case that the vampire was awake'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, if it's not the case that the vampire was awake, then it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake. This is a tautology, meaning it's always true, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
