In formal logic, a conditional argument is of the form: If P, then Q. Not-P, therefore not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'The newspaper might not be in the driveway', which is a denial of 'The newspaper must be in the driveway'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway'.\n\nSince the premise and the conclusion deny the same thing, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
