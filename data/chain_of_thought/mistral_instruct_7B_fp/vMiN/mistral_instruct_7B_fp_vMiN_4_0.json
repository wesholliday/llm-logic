In this case, the other conditional statement is 'If the alien has visited Mars, then the alien must have visited Mars'.\n\nThe logical form of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Not (If the alien has visited Mars, then the alien must have visited Mars)\n2. Therefore, It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid.\n\nThe logical form of the argument is a valid form of argument known as \"denying the consequent\" or \"modus tollens\". This form of argument is valid because if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the conditional statement itself must be false, which means that the negation of the antecedent must be true. In this case, the consequent is 'the alien must have visited Mars', which is denied in the conclusion, so the negation of the antecedent 'The alien might have visited Mars' must be true, which is stated in the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid."
