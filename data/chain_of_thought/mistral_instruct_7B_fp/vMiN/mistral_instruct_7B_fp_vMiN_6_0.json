In other words, if the premise is true, does that mean the conclusion must be true?\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\n1. Premise: Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n2. Conclusion: It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the negation of the premise. If the premise is true, then it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
