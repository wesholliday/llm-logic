In a conditional argument, the form is 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'The book might not have been written by James' and Q is 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'.\n\nThe logical form of this argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If not-James (the book was not written by James), then not-Must-James (it's not the case that the book must have been written by James)\n2. Not-James\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James' directly follows from the premise 'The book might not have been written by James'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
