In formal logic, this type of argument is known as a double negation elimination.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'Jeff might not have played basketball', which is equivalent to 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball', which is the same as the premise.\n\nSince the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
