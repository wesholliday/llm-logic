In formal logic, this type of argument is known as \"denying the opposite\" or \"double negation elimination\".\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'The dog might not have been inside', which is equivalent to 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside'.\n\nSince the premise and the conclusion are logically equivalent, this argument is a valid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
