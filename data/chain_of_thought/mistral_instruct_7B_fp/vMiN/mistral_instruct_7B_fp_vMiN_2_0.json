The negation of the conclusion 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' can be written as 'It is not the case that if the griffin might have been in the forest, then the griffin must have been in the forest'. This is logically equivalent to 'It is possible that the griffin might have been in the forest and the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if the negation of the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the negation of the conclusion does follow logically from the premise, because the premise 'The griffin might not have been in the forest' is logically consistent with 'It is possible that the griffin might have been in the forest and the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
