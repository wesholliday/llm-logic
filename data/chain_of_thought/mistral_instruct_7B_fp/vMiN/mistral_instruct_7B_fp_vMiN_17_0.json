In formal logic, a conditional argument is of the form: If P, then Q. The contrapositive of this argument is: If not Q, then not P.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack', which is the contrapositive of 'It must be the case that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nSince the premise and the conclusion are logically equivalent (they mean the same thing), this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
