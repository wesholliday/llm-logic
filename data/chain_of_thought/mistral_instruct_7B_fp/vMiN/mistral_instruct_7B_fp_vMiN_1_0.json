The conditional statement in this case is 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'.\n\nThe logical form of this argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nIn this case, the truth of the premise 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding'. This is because the premise only tells us that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not rule out the possibility that she was there. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
