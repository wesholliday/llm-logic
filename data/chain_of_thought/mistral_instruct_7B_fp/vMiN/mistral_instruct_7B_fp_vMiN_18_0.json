In formal logic, a conditional argument is of the form: If P, then Q. The contrapositive of this argument is: If not Q, then not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\n1. The notebook might not be in the drawer (Premise)\n2. It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer (Conclusion)\n\nThe contrapositive of this argument is:\n\n1. It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer (not Q)\n2. It's not the case that the notebook might not be in the drawer (not P)\n\nSince the premise of the original argument is the denial of the contrapositive of the conclusion, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
