In symbolic logic, this argument can be represented as:\n\n1. \u00acP (The jacket might not be draped over the chair)\n2. \u00acQ (It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair)\n\nThe logical form of this argument is a denial of the conclusion from a denial of the premise, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic, known as \"contrapositive\" or \"obverse\" argument.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
