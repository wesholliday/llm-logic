In formal logic, this type of argument is known as \"denying the inverse\" or \"affirming the consequent\".\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'The toy might not be in the toy box', which is a denial of the negation of 'The toy is in the toy box'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box', which is a denial of 'The toy must be in the toy box'.\n\nHowever, denying the inverse or affirming the consequent is a fallacy in classical logic, because the truth of the premise does not necessarily imply the truth of the conclusion. In other words, just because the toy might not be in the toy box, it does not mean that the toy must not be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
