A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nThe argument given is:\n1. The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n2. Therefore, it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nThe first premise is a statement that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, which is equivalent to saying that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag (not P).\n\nThe second premise is a denial of the contrapositive of the first premise, which is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" (not Q).\n\nSince the second premise is the denial of the contrapositive of the first premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
