The general form of this argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not (P).\n3. Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'The milk might not be on the counter', which can be rewritten as 'If the milk is on the counter, then it might not be the case that the milk is on the counter'. The conclusion is 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' is a negation of 'The milk must be on the counter'. Since the premise 'The milk might not be on the counter' is a negation of 'The milk must be on the counter', the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
