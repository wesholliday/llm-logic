In other words, if the premise is true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nIn this case, the premise 'Alex might not have finished the race' does not imply that 'Alex must not have finished the race'. It only implies that it's possible that Alex did not finish the race. However, it does not rule out the possibility that Alex did finish the race. Therefore, it's not the case that 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race' necessarily follows from 'Alex might not have finished the race'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
