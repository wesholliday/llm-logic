However, this statement does not exclude the possibility that the package was delivered the day before. Therefore, based on this information, we cannot definitively say that the package was not delivered on the current day, but we can infer that it was delivered at least one day before the current day. So, 'The package must have been delivered the day before' is a valid inference from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
