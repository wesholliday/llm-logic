However, it does not necessarily mean that the document must have been notarized. It only implies that if the document was not signed, then it must have been notarized, but it does not exclude the possibility that the document was both signed and notarized. Therefore, based on this statement, we cannot infer that 'The document must have been notarized'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
