            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The contract must have been valid for a year or renewable' means that the contract either had a duration of one year or it was capable of being extended or renewed beyond its initial term. From this, we cannot directly infer that the contract was renewed at any point, but we can infer that it had the potential to be renewed. Therefore, while we cannot say 'yes' to 'The contract was renewable', we can say 'yes' to 'The contract must have been renewable'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
