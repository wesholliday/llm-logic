However, it does not exclude the possibility of the event being semi-formal. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the event was semi-formal based on this information alone, we cannot rule it out either.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The event must have been semi-formal' from 'The event must have been formal or semi-formal'. However, it does not mean that the event was not semi-formal."
