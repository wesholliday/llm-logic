            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours' is a disjunction, meaning it consists of two mutually exclusive options. The first option is that the restaurant was closed on Monday, and the second option is that it was open for limited hours.\n\nTo infer that 'The restaurant must have been open for limited hours' from this statement, we would need to have additional information that rules out the first option, i.e., the restaurant being closed on Monday. Without such information, we cannot make this inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The restaurant must have been open for limited hours' from 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours' alone."
