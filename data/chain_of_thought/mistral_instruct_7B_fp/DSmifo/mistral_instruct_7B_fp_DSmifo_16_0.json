The second statement 'Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag' is a logical statement that states that the pen must be either on the desk or in the bag, and there is no other option.\n\nHowever, since the first statement only states that the pen might not be on the desk, it does not necessarily mean that the pen is in the bag. It could also mean that the pen is somewhere else, such as in another room or lost. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
