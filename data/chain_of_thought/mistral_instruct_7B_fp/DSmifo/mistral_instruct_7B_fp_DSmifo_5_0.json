The second statement 'Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar' is a logical statement that presents two mutually exclusive options: either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. Since the first statement does not rule out the possibility that the cookies are in the jar, we cannot infer from these two statements that 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
