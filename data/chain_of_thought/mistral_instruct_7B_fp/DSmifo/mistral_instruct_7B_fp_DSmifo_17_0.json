The second statement 'Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack' is a logical statement that presents two mutually exclusive options. If the scarf is not on the coat rack (as suggested by the first statement), then it must be stuffed in your backpack (as stated in the second statement).\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
