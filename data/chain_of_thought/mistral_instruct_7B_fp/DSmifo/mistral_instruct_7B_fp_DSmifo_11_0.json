The second statement 'Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway' is a disjunctive statement that states two mutually exclusive possibilities: the newspaper is on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not rule out the possibility that the newspaper is in the driveway. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
