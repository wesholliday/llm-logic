The second statement gives us two possibilities: the toy is on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not rule out the possibility that the toy is in the toy box. In fact, it does not provide any information about where the toy is if it is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The toy is in the toy box' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
