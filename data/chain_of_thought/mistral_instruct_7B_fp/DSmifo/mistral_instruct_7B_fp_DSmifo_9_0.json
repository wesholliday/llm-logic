It suggests that if the piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily rule out the possibility that the piece is in the box. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
