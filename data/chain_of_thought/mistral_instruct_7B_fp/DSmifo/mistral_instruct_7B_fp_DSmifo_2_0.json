The first statement suggests that the book could be in a state where it is not resting on the table, but it does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf. However, the first statement does not provide enough information to confirm that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book is on the shelf' based on the given information."
