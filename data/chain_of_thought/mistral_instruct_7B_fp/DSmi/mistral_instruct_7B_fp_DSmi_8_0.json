The second statement 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch' suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
