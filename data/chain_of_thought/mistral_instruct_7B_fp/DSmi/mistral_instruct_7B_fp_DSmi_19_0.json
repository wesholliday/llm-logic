The second statement 'The watch might not be on his wrist' does not necessarily contradict the first statement, as it only suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist, not that it is definitely not on the dresser charging. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
