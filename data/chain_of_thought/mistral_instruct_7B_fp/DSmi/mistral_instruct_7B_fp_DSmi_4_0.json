The second statement 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom' does not contradict the first statement, as it only states that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, not that it is not napping on the couch. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cat is napping on the couch' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
