The second statement 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
