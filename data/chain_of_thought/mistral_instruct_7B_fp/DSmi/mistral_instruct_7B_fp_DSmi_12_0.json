The second statement 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet' suggests that there's a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. However, this statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair. The jacket could be somewhere else, such as on a bed or a sofa, that is not mentioned in the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair' based on the given information."
