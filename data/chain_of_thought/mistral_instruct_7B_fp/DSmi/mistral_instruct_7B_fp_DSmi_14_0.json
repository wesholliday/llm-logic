The second statement 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter. It only states that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, which does not necessarily mean it is on the counter. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The milk is on the counter' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
