In this case, 'The flimble might be grazzle by glorp and be blimp quank' is not logically derivable from 'The flimble might be grazzle by glorp' unless there is additional information or context that establishes a relationship between 'grazzle', 'glorp', 'blimp', and 'quank'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flimble might be grazzle by glorp and be blimp quank' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
