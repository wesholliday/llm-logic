            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of this statement would be 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'. This is not necessarily true, as the color of the apple is not determined by the color of the banana.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow'. This statement is saying that if the apple is not red, then the banana cannot be yellow. This is a logical conclusion if we assume that the original statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is always true. However, this is not necessarily true based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference."
