It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not mean that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins must be something other than blueberry. The statement only tells us about the relationship between chocolate cake and blueberry muffins, not about any other possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
