This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is a fact that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. It also does not mean that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe statement 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is a different statement that cannot be inferred from the given statement. This statement means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is a fact that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. But this is not necessarily true based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'."
