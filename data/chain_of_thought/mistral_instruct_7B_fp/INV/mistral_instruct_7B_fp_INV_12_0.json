This means that if Joe went to the park, then it is a fact that Lucy went to the zoo. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse of the given statement: 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then it is a fact that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo infer this statement from the given statement, we need to prove that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy could not have gone to the zoo. But the given statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
