This means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, and vice versa if the cat is outside, then the dog must be inside. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the dog is not inside. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
