The correct statement should be 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race as well'. However, since the statement is incorrect, we cannot infer anything from it.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider a valid conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race as well'.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n2. If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race either, because the condition for Chris to finish the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on a valid conditional statement, we can infer that if Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race either."
