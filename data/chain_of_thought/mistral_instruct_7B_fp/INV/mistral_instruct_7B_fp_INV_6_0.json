However, it does not mean that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza. It only implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. This means that if Sue does not choose pizza, then Bob cannot choose pasta.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer this from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta. It does not tell us anything about what Bob chooses if Sue does not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
