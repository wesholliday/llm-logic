This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, the statement does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
