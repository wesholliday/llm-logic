However, this does not mean that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin also did not take a train. The given statement only establishes a relationship between Sam and Erin's modes of transportation when Sam takes a plane. It does not imply anything about their modes of transportation when Sam does not take a plane.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The given statement does not allow us to infer 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train'."
