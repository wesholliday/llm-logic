This type of statement implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not imply anything about the relationship between P and Q if P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
