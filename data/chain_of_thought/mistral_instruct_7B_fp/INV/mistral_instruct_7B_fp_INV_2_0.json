            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. This type of statement implies that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q is also true. However, it does not imply that if P is false, then Q is also false.\n\nTo infer 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest', we would need an additional piece of information. This additional information could be in the form of a second conditional statement, such as 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn is never in the forest'. But without this additional information, we cannot infer that 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
