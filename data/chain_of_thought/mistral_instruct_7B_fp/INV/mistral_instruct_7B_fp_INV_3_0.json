This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the book was written by James) is true, then the second part (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. The converse is 'If the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James'. This statement is not necessarily true, as there could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'. This statement is a contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then interchanging them. In this case, the hypothesis is 'the book was written by James' and the conclusion is 'the book is a mystery novel'. So, the contrapositive is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James'.\n\nTo determine if this contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we need to check if they have the same truth value. If they do, then the contrapositive is a valid inference.\n\nLet's consider a possible scenario:\n1. If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel (original statement).\n2. If it is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James (contrapositive).\n\nNow, let's test these statements in a scenario where they are both true:\n1. James wrote a mystery novel.\n2. This mystery novel is not a mystery novel (this is a contradiction, as a mystery novel by definition is a mystery novel).\n3. Therefore, the original statement is true, but the contrapositive is not.\n\nHowever, let's consider another scenario where they are both false:\n1. James did not write a mystery novel.\n2. This book is not a mystery novel (this is true, as it was not written by James).\n3. Therefore, the contrapositive is true, but the original statement is not.\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive do not have the same truth value in all scenarios, we cannot infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'."
