This type of statement does not necessarily imply the converse, which is 'If not P, then not Q'. The converse is not logically valid based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'."
