            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This type of conditional statement implies that if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) is also true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the condition (P) is false, then the consequence (Q) is also false.\n\nIn other words, the given statement does not provide enough information to infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is because the statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' based on the given statement."
