            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'. This type of statement implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that if P is false, then Q must also be false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue' directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
