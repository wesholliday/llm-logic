This statement means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, it does not imply anything about the relationship between 'not plastic doll' and 'not metal truck'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
