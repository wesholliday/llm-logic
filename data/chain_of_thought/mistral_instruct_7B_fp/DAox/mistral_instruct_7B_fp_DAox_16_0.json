The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any information about the situation if the sneg was not crampled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
