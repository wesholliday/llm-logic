The second statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' is a conditional statement, which means that if the shank was in the state of being plooked, then it would also be in the state of being nugged. However, since we know that the shank was not plooked, we cannot infer that it was not nugged. The information provided does not allow us to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The shank was not nugged' based on the given statements."
