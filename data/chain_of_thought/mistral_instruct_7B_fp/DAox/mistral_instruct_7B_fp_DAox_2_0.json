The first statement tells us that the wug did not perform the action of 'flooping'. The second statement gives us a conditional rule: if the wug were to 'floop', then it would 'bim the zoint'. However, since we know that the wug did not 'floop', we cannot apply the conditional rule and cannot infer that the wug 'bimmed the zoint'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wug did not bim the zoint' based on the given statements."
