The second statement gives us a conditional statement, which means that if the fribble was in the state of being 'snurgled', then it would also be in the state of 'crinked'.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us anything about the state of 'crinked'. It only tells us that the fribble was not 'snurgled'. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble did not 'crink' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
