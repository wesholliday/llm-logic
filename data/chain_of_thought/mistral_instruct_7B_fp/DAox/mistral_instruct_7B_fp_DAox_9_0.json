The second statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' is a conditional statement that implies that if the twonk was hit, then it was varnished. However, since we know that the twonk was not hit, we cannot infer that it was varnished based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not varnished'."
