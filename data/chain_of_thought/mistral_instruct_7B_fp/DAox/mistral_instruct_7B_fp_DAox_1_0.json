'The flugel was not blimmed' means that the flugel was not in a certain state or underwent a certain action.\n2. 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the flugel was in the state of being blimmed, then it would also be in the state of being zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can infer 'The flugel was not zargled' from the given statements:\n\nSince 'The flugel was not blimmed', it means that the flugel did not undergo the action or reach the state that would trigger the 'if' part of the conditional statement. Therefore, even if the 'if' part of the conditional statement were true (i.e., 'if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'), it would not apply in this case because the 'if' part is not true (the flugel was not blimmed).\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to definitively say that 'The flugel was zargled' is false. The conditional statement only tells us that if the flugel were blimmed, it would also be zargled. It does not say that the flugel must be zargled if it is not blimmed.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not zargled' from the given statements. The given statements do not provide enough information to make such a conclusion."
