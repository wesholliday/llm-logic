'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' means that if the fleeg was wet or dirty, then it would have surrendered or given up.\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can infer 'The fleeg did not surn' from these statements.\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to infer that the fleeg did not surrender. The first statement only tells us that the fleeg was not wet or dirty, but it does not tell us anything about the fleeg's attitude or willingness to surrender. The second statement tells us that if the fleeg was wet or dirty, it would have surrendered, but it does not tell us whether the fleeg was wet or dirty. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg did not surn' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fleeg did not surn' from 'The fleeg was not bluttered' and 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'."
