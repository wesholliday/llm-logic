The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanked) is also true.\n\nHowever, since we know that the condition is not true (the splat was not morphed), we cannot automatically conclude that the consequence is also not true. In other words, just because the splat was not morphed, it does not mean that it also did not quank.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The splat did not quank' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
