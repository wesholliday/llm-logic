The second statement is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the wug was not sproonged. The second statement tells us that if the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about the case where the wug was not sproonged. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The wug was not garpled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
