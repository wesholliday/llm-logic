This means that the glip was not 'slogged' or put together in a certain way.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first condition (the glip was slogged) is true, then the second condition (the glip was tragged) must also be true.\n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that the glip was not slogged, the conditional statement does not apply because the first condition is not true. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the second condition (whether the glip was tragged) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The glip was not tragged' based on the given information."
