The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flug was blummed) is true, then the consequence (the flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n\nHowever, since we know that the condition is not true (the flug was not blummed), we cannot infer that the consequence is also not true. In other words, just because the flug was not blummed, it does not mean that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
