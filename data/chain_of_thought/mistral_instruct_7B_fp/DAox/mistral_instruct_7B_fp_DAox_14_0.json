'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' means that if the clug was in a good or stylish condition, then it would also be snugged (fitting well or comfortably).\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to infer 'The clug was not snugged'. The first statement only tells us that the clug was not in a good condition, but it does not say anything about whether it was snug or not. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The clug was not snugged' from the given statements."
