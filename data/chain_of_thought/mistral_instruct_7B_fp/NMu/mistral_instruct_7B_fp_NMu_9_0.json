            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' means that there is at least one scenario where Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that she did not buy it in all scenarios. However, since 'must' implies that it is a necessary condition, its negation 'not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' implies that it is not a necessary condition, which means that it is possible for Lisa not to have bought the red shirt. Therefore, 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' can be inferred.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
