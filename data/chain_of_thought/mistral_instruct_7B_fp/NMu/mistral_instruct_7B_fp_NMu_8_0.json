This implies that there is at least one situation where the vampire was not awake, but it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was never awake. However, since the statement does not rule out the possibility that the vampire was never awake, it is reasonable to infer that 'The vampire might not have been awake'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
