This statement does not rule out the possibility that the alien might have visited Mars, but it also does not provide any evidence to support that the alien has visited Mars. Therefore, based on the given statement, we cannot conclude with certainty that 'The alien might not have visited Mars', but we can infer that 'The alien might not have visited Mars' is a possible interpretation.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it can be inferred."
