This could be due to various reasons such as James not being the author, the book being a translation, or the book being a collaborative work.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that 'The book might not have been written by James' because the original statement already implies that there is at least one possibility where James is not the author.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
