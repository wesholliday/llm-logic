This statement does not exclude the possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, but it also does not provide any information about where the watch might be or what it might be doing. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that 'The watch might be charging on the dresser', we can infer that 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser' because the statement does not require the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
