This does not necessarily mean that she did choose pizza in other scenarios, but it also does not rule out the possibility. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say 'Sue might not have chosen pizza', we cannot also say with certainty that she did choose pizza. So, it is reasonable to infer that 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
