            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag' means that the pen is not necessarily required to be in the bag. This implies that the pen could be outside the bag or anywhere else, not just in the bag. However, this statement does not explicitly say that the pen is not in the bag either. Therefore, while it's not the case that the pen must be in the bag, it does not necessarily mean that the pen might not be in the bag either.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The pen might not be in my bag' from 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag'."
