However, it does not necessarily mean that the software has been restarted after the update. Restarting the software is often recommended after an update to ensure that the changes take effect, but it is not always necessary or automatically done. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The software must have been updated and restarted' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
