In this case, 'flibbit floob' and 'flibbit blimple' are the two options. However, the statement does not necessarily mean that 'The wozzle must be flibbit blimple'. It only means that 'The wozzle must be either flibbit floob or flibbit blimple'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wozzle must be flibbit blimple' based on this statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
