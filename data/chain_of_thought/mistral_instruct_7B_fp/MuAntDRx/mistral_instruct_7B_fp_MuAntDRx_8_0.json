This means that either 'The snizzle must be grooble on frazzle' or 'The snizzle must be shimble for flim flim' must be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'The snizzle must be shimble for flim flim' is true without the first condition being false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The snizzle must be shimble for flim flim' from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: No."
