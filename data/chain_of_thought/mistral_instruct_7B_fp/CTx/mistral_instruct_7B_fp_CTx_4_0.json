            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'. This statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second part (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of this statement would be 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled'. This statement is not necessarily true, as the fribble could have crinked for some other reason.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'. This statement is also a conditional statement, but it is a different kind of conditional statement. It is a contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then interchanging them. In this case, the hypothesis is 'the fribble was snurgled' and the conclusion is 'the fribble crinked'. So, the contrapositive is 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'.\n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to consider all possible scenarios. If the fribble was not snurgled, then it is true that the fribble did not crink. This is because the original statement tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must also crink. If the fribble was not snurgled, then it cannot crink according to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive is a logically valid statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
