This means that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement, 'If Q, then P', is not necessarily true. This means that just because the flug was zimmed, it does not necessarily mean that it was also blummed.\n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If not Q, then not P'. This means that if the flug was not zimmed, then it was not also blummed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
