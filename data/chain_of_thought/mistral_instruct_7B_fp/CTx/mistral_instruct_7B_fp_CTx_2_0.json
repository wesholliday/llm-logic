This means that if the wug was flooped (whatever 'flooped' means in this context), then the wug also bimmed the zoint. However, this does not mean that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then it was not flooped. The statement only establishes a relationship between flooping and bimming the zoint, but it does not imply that not bimming the zoint implies not being flooped.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from the given statement."
