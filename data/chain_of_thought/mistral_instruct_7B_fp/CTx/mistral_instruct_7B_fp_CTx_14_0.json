            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug snugged) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of this statement would be 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked'. This is not necessarily true, as the fleeked-ness of the clug is not directly implied by the snugged-ness of the clug.\n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. Applying this to our original statement, we get 'If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
