This means that if the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged.\n\nHowever, to infer 'If not Q, then not P' from this statement, we would need to have a second conditional statement 'If not Q, then not P' that is logically equivalent to the original statement. But the given statement does not provide such a second conditional. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
