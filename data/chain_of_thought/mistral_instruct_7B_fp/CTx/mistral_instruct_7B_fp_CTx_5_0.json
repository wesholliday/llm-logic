It means that if the zinger is in a state of being 'fraggled', then it must also be in a state of being 'smoogled'. However, this statement does not provide any information about the reverse condition, i.e., if the zinger is not 'smoogled', then it is not 'fraggled'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
