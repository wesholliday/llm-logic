This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn the given statement, we cannot infer 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed' because the statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
