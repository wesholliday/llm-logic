This means that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged. The given statement does not provide any information about the relationship between 'not tragged' and 'not slogged'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
