            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the second part (the grommet plopped the frink) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of this statement would be 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed'. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other ways for the grommet to plop the frink that do not involve the grommet being sploffed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'. This is a different kind of conditional statement, known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then interchanging them. In this case, the hypothesis is 'the grommet was sploffed' and the conclusion is 'the grommet plopped the frink'. So, the contrapositive would be 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to consider if its contrapositive is a logical consequence of the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive is a logical consequence of the original statement. If the grommet did not plop the frink, then it cannot be the case that the grommet was sploffed and also plopped the frink. Therefore, the grommet must not have been sploffed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
