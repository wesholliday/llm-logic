            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the wug was sproinged' and Q is 'it was garpled'. This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTo infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged', we would need an additional piece of information. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. However, we cannot infer this directly from the given statement without more information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'. This is because the given statement does not provide enough information to make this inference."
