It means that if the whiffle (a type of ball) was shanked (hit poorly, often resulting in an unusual sound), then the whiffle tinked (made a specific sound, possibly a unique sound associated with a shanked shot).\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the whiffle did not tink, it does not mean that the whiffle was not shanked. The whiffle might have been hit well, or it might have hit something that did not produce the tink sound. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
