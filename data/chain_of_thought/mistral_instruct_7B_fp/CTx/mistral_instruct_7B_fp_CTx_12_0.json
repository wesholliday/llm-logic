            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is an if-then statement: 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'. This means that if the condition 'the smip was shripped' is true, then the consequence 'the smip lupped the zoint' must also be true.\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because 'the smip lupped the zoint' is not true, it does not mean that 'the smip was shripped' is also not true. It could be that 'the smip was shripped' is still true, but the consequence 'the smip lupped the zoint' is false.\n\nBut, if we want to make a statement about the absence of the consequence, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the statement 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped' is the contrapositive of the original statement. This means that if the consequence 'the smip lupped the zoint' is false, then the condition 'the smip was shripped' must also be false.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
