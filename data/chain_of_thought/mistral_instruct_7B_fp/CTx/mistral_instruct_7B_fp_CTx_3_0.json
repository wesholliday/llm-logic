            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the splat was morphed' and Q is 'the splat quanked'. This means that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked.\n\nNow, we want to infer a new conditional statement 'If not Q, then not P'. Here, 'not Q' means 'the splat did not quank'.\n\nTo infer this new statement, we need to consider the original conditional statement and its logical structure. The original statement is a 'material implication'. This means that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. In other words, if Q is false, it does not necessarily mean that P is false.\n\nIn our case, if 'the splat did not quank' (Q is false), it does not necessarily mean that 'the splat was not morphed' (P is false). Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
