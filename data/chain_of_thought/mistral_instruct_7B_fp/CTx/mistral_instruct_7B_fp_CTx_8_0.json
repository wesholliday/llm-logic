A contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, 'P' is 'the sprocket was cranked' and 'Q' is 'the sprocket was daggled'.\n\nSince the original statement is a contrapositive, it means that if the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked. This is because the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
