This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the fleeg did not surned, then it was not bluttered. The absence of surning does not necessarily imply the absence of bluttering. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
