This means that if the snow is crampled, then it sprouts the frink. However, this does not mean that if the snow does not sprout the frink, then it was not crampled. The given statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'."
