This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is not awake.\n\nNow, to infer 'If Q, then P', we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake' is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, based on the given statement and the principle of contrapositive, we can infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake'."
