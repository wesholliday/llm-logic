This means that if Joe went to the park, then it is a fact that Lucy did not go to the zoo. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse statement is 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This means that if Lucy went to the zoo, then it must be a fact that Joe did not go to the park. But the given statement does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that this is always the case. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
