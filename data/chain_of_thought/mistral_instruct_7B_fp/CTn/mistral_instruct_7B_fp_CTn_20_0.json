            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was not yellow'. This statement means that if the apple is red, then the banana is not yellow.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'If Q, then P' from this statement. Here, Q is 'the banana was yellow' and we want to know if we can infer 'P' which is 'the apple was red'.\n\nTo infer 'If Q, then P', we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow' is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'.\n\nNow, we need to check if this contrapositive is true or false. If it is true, then we can infer 'If Q, then P'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nLet's check if the contrapositive is true:\n\nThe contrapositive is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'.\n\nIf the banana was not yellow, then according to the original statement, the apple must be red. So, the contrapositive is true.\n\nSince the contrapositive is true, we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red'."
