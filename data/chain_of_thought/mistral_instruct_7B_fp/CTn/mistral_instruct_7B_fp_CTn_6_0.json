Here, P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nThe statement 'If P, then Q' means that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must be true. However, it does not mean that if Q is false, then P must be false.\n\nIn other words, the statement 'If P, then Q' does not imply the contrapositive 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, from 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta', we cannot infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
