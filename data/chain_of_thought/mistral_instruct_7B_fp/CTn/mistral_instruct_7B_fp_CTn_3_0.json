            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is not a mystery novel'. This statement means that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', we would need to have a contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. Here, 'not Q' means 'the book is a mystery novel' and 'not P' means 'the book was not written by James'.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. The statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel. It does not tell us that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it must have been written by someone other than James. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
