            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were not denim'. This statement means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants cannot be denim.\n\nNow, to infer 'If Q, then P' from this statement, we need to check if the converse of the original statement holds true. The converse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'.\n\nIn this case, the converse statement is 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. This means that if the pants are denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer this statement directly from the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'. We need additional information or assumptions to make this inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' directly from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'."
