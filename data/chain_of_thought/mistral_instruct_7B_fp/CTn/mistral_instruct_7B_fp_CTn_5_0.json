This means that if Jeff plays basketball, then it is a fact that Amy does not play tennis. However, it does not provide any information about whether Jeff plays basketball or not, or whether Amy plays tennis or not.\n\nThe question now is 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. This statement is not logically equivalent to the given statement. The new statement is saying that if Amy plays tennis, then Jeff does not play basketball. But this does not mean that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy does not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
