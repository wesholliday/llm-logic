            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the dog was inside' and Q is 'the cat was not outside'. This type of statement means that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is true, then P must be false.\n\nIn this case, the given statement does not allow us to infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside'. This is because the given statement only tells us that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside or not outside (since it's not inside). It does not tell us that if the cat is outside, then the dog must be inside or not inside.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside'."
