            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it must be the case that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, this does not mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In fact, it is not necessarily true that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario:\n1. Lisa bought the red shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nIn this scenario, the given statement is true. However, if we were to change the scenario to the following:\n1. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nIn this scenario, the statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is still true, but the statement 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
