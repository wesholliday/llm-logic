            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was not blue'. This statement means that if the car is red, then the truck cannot be blue.\n\nNow, we want to infer 'If Q, then P' which means 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red'. This statement means that if the truck is blue, then the car cannot be red.\n\nTo infer this statement, we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue' is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nSince the original statement is true, its contrapositive should also be true. Therefore, 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' can be inferred.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
