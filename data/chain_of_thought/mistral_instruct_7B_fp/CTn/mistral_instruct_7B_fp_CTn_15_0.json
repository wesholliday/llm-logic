            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then another event (Erin not taking a train) must occur.\n\nHowever, the inverse of this statement is not necessarily true. The inverse statement is 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane'. This means that if Erin takes a train, then Sam must not take a plane.\n\nBut the given statement does not provide enough information to support this inverse statement. The given statement only tells us that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin does not take a train. It does not tell us anything about what happens if Erin takes a train. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane' based on the given statement."
