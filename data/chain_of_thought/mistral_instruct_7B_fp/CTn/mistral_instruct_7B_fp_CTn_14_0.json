            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was not in the den'. This type of conditional statement means that if the first condition (P) is true, then the second condition (Q) must be true.\n\nHowever, to infer 'If Q, then not-P' (where Q is 'the wolf was in the den' and not-P is 'the bear was not in the cave'), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not-Q, then not-P'.\n\nIn our case, the contrapositive would be 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. This means that if the second condition (Q) is not true, then the first condition (P) must not be true.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. The given statement only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf cannot be in the den. It does not tell us anything about what happens when the wolf is in the den.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' based on the given information."
