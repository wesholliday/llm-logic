This statement means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate. This is a different conditional statement, and its truth value cannot be inferred from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry'."
