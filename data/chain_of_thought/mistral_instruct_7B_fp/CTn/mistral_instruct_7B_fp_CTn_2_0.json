            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was not in the forest'. This statement means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'If Q, then P' from this statement. Here, Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest' and P is 'the griffin was not in the forest'. This statement means that if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nTo infer 'If Q, then P' from 'If P, then Q', we need to check if the two statements have the same logical structure. In other words, we need to check if swapping P and Q in the first statement results in a logically equivalent statement.\n\nIn this case, swapping P and Q in the first statement gives us 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'. This is exactly the same as the second statement we want to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' from 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
