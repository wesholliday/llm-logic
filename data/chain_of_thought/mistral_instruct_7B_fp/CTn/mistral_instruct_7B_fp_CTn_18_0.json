            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was not metal'. This statement means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be metal.\n\nNow, to infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic', we need to convert the given statement into its contrapositive form. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal' is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nHowever, the statement 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' is not the same as the contrapositive. The correct form of the inference from the given statement is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll could be plastic or not plastic (we cannot infer anything about the doll's material from the truck being metal)'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
