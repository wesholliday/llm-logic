This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it must be the case that Kate did not eat the salad. However, it does not mean that if Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. This is because the original statement does not provide any information about what Kate did when Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
