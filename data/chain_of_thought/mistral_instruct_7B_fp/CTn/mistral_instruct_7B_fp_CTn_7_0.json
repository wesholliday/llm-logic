            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the two events: Alex finishing the race and Chris not finishing the race. This statement is an example of a contrapositive, which means that if the first condition (Alex finishing) is true, then the second condition (Chris not finishing) must be true.\n\nHowever, to infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race', we would need to have a contrapositive of the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex finished the race'. But since this is not the given statement, we cannot infer the opposite statement directly from the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race' from 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race'."
