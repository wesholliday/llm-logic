However, it is also stated that the missing sock is not under the bed. This means that the only remaining possibility for the missing sock is the laundry basket. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that the missing sock is in the laundry basket with 100% certainty, but it is the only logical conclusion that can be drawn from the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, but it is the most likely place for it to be."
