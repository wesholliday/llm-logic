The first clause states that the zooble must be in quork, and the second clause states that the zooble must quimble flim.\n\nHowever, the second clause 'it must quimble flim' is not clear in its meaning. It seems to be a misspelling or a mistake, as 'quimble' is not a known verb or action.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to infer 'The zooble must be in quork and quimble flim' from the given sentence, as the second clause is not clear or meaningful.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
