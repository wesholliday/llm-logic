The first condition is 'must be wobble', and the second condition is 'must be zooble'. The statement 'can we infer 'The glorp must be wobble and zooble'?' is asking if we can infer that the two conditions are combined into a single condition.\n\nHowever, the given statement does not imply that 'The glorp must be wobble and zooble' is a valid inference. The two conditions are presented as separate conditions, and there is no indication that they are meant to be combined in this way. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glorp must be wobble and zooble' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
