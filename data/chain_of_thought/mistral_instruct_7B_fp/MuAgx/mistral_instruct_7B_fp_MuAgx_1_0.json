The first sentence says that the flimble must be zazzle and must blimple a quazzle. The second sentence, which is the question, is asking if we can infer that the flimble must be zazzle and must blimple a quazzle from the first sentence. Since the two sentences are identical, the answer is yes, we can infer that 'The flimble must be zazzle and blimple a quazzle' from 'From 'The flimble must be zazzle and it must blimple a quazzle', can we infer 'The flimble must be zazzle and blimple a quazzle'?'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
