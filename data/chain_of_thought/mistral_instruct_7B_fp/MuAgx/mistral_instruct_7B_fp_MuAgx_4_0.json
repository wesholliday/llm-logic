            "content": "Explanation: The two phrases 'The quorple must be at snork gribble' and 'it must be in the wibble plonk' are separate statements in the original sentence. The first statement is about the location of the quorple, and the second statement is about a different place, the wibble plonk. The second statement does not specify that the quorple is also in the wibble plonk. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
