The first clause states that 'The gribble must be flim on snork', and the second clause states that 'it must blimple quazzle flim'. However, the second clause does not specify who or what 'it' refers to. Since 'it' is not explicitly linked to 'The gribble' in the first clause, we cannot infer that 'The gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim' based on the given sentence.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
