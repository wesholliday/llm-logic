The second statement 'The pen might not be on my desk' means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk. However, this statement does not provide any information about where the pen might be if it is not on the desk. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The pen is in my bag' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
