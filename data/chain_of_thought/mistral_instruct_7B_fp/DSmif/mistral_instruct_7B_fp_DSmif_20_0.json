The second statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' suggests that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in her bag. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The sunglasses are in her bag'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
