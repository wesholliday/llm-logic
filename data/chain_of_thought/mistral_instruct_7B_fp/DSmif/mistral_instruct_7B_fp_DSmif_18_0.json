However, the statement 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' means that it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it does not necessarily mean that it is in the drawer. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The notebook is in the drawer' based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
