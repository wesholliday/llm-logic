However, it does not specify which one is true. The statement 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' is an expression of uncertainty or possibility, and it does not contradict the first statement. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The milk is on the counter'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
