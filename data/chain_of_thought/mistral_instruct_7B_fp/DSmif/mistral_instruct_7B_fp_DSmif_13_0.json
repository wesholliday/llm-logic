The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' means that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, this statement does not provide any information about where the toy might be if it is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The toy is in the toy box' based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
