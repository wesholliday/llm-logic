The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about where Fido actually is. The first statement only tells us that Fido is either in the garden or inside, but it does not specify which one. The second statement only tells us that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not tell us where Fido is if he is not in the garden.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
