However, the second statement 'The missing sock isn't under the bed' tells us that the missing sock is not in its first possible location. Since we know that the sock is not under the bed, and we also know that it must be in one of the two places, then the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
