The second statement 'The book might not be resting on the table' means that it is possible that the book is not in its first possible location (resting on the table). However, this statement does not provide any information about the book's second possible location (on the shelf). Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book is on the shelf' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
