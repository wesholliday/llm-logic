            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar' is a disjunction, meaning it states that either one or the other condition must be true. The second statement 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry' negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. Since the disjunction states that either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar, and we know they are not hidden in the pantry, then the only remaining option is that they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
