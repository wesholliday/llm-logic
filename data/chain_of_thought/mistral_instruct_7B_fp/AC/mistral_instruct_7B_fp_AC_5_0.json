This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) is also true. The second statement is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true or false. The fact that Amy played tennis does not necessarily mean that Jeff also played basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Jeff played basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
