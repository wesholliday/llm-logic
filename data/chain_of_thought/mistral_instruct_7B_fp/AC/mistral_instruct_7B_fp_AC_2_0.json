(Let's call this Premise 2)\n\nTo infer 'The griffin was in the forest', we need to use logical reasoning to determine if Premise 1 and Premise 2 together imply that the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nIn order to do this, we can use the concept of modus ponens, which is a form of logical deduction that states: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nIn this case, P is the statement \"The griffin was in the forest\", and Q is the statement \"The unicorn was in the forest\". Premise 1 tells us that if P is true, then Q is also true. Premise 2 tells us that Q is indeed true. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can infer that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on the given premises, we can infer that the griffin was also in the forest."
