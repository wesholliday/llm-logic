This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. The second statement given is 'The mummy was awake'. This statement tells us that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\nNow, to infer whether the vampire is awake or not, we need to look at the relationship between the two statements. Since the second statement tells us that the mummy is awake, and the first statement tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, we can infer that the vampire must also be awake.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
