It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. The second statement 'Chris finished the race' tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between the two statements. If the condition in the first statement (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finishing the race) is also true. Since we know that Chris finished the race, it means that the condition (Alex finishing the race) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on the given information, we can infer that Alex finished the race."
