This is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Ben eating pasta) occurs, then another event (Kate eating the salad) follows. The second statement given is 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first statement is also true. In other words, just because Kate ate the salad, it does not mean that Ben necessarily ate pasta. The second statement only tells us that Kate ate the salad, not whether Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'Ben ate pasta'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
