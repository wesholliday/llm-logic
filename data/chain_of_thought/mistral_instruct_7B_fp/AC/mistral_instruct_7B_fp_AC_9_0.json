            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information given. We know that Mark bought the blue shirt. According to the first statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would also have bought the blue shirt. Since we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that Lisa could have bought the red shirt, or she might not have. The statement 'Mark bought the blue shirt' does not provide enough information to infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' based on the given information."
