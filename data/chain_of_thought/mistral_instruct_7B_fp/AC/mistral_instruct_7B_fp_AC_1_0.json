This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about the original conditional statement. If the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. Since we know that the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is true, it means that the condition (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
