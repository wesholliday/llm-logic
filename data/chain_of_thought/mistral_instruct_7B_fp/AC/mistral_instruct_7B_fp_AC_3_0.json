The first statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. The second statement is 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not directly imply that the book was written by James. The first statement suggests that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. But the second statement only tells us that the book is a mystery novel, not that it was written by James. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book was written by James' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
