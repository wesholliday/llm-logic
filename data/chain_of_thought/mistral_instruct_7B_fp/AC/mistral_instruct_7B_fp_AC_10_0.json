It means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. The second statement 'The cat was outside' is a fact.\n\nTo infer 'The dog was inside', we need to check if the first condition (the dog being inside) leads to the second condition (the cat being outside). Since the second condition is a fact, we know that the cat was outside. According to the first condition, if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside. But since the cat is outside, it means that the dog cannot be inside at the same time, because that would violate the first condition.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
