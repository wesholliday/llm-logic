This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. The second statement is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first part (Joe went to the park) is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. But it does not tell us that Joe actually went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Joe went to the park' based on 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
