This is a conditional statement, meaning if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. The second statement is 'The pants were denim'. This statement tells us that the pants indeed are denim.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not allow us to infer that the shirt is cotton. The second statement only tells us that the pants are denim, but it does not confirm that the shirt is cotton as stated in the first condition. Therefore, we cannot make this inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
