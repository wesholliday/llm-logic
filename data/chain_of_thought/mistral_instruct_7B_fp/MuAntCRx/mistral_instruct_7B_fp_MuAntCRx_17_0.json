However, this sentence does not provide enough information to infer 'The quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit and be flibbit by zizz'. This new sentence suggests a different sequence of actions, where 'frazzle' is the consequence and 'flibbit' is the condition, and 'be flibbit by zizz' is an additional condition. Therefore, we cannot infer this new sentence from the given one.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
