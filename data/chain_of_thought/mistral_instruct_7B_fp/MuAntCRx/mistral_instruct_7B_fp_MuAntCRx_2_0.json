In this case, the original statement 'The grazzle must flump a bimboozle quazzle' does not provide enough information to infer 'The grazzle must glorp a zibble snizzle and flump a bimboozle quazzle'. The second statement contains additional elements ('glorp a zibble snizzle') that are not present in the first statement. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
