However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge, but it does not necessarily mean that the milk is on the counter. The statement only tells us that the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge, not where it is. Therefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter."
