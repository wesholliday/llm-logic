The second part of the statement, \"Also, it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor,\" means that the missing piece is not necessarily blending in on the floor, but it could still be in the box. Since we know that the missing piece cannot be blending in on the floor, and we also know that it must be either in the box or blending in on the floor, then the only remaining possibility is that the missing piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
