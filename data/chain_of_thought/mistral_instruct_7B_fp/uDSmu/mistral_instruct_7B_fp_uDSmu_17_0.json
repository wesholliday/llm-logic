However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. This means that the scarf cannot be on the coat rack under any circumstances, not even if the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack.\n\nSince the scarf cannot be on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
