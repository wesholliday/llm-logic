It also mentions that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that while it's not necessarily true that the watch is on his wrist, it's also not necessarily true that it's not on the dresser charging. However, since we know that it's not on his wrist, the only other option left is that it's charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
