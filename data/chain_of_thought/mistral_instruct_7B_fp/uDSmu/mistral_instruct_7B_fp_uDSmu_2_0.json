However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book cannot be forced to be on the table, but it could still be on the table if it's not on the shelf. Since we know that the book cannot be forced to be on the table, and the statement does not provide any other information about the book's location, we cannot infer with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf."
