The second part of the statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" means that Fido is not required to be in the garden, but he could still be there. Since we know that Fido cannot be in any other location and he is not required to be in the garden, we cannot infer that Fido is inside with the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
