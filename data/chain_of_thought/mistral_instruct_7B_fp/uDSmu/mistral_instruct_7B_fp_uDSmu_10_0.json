However, it is also stated that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that while it could be under the bed, it is not necessarily so. The sock could still be in the laundry basket. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, but we also cannot rule it out based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer with certainty that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, but we also cannot rule it out."
