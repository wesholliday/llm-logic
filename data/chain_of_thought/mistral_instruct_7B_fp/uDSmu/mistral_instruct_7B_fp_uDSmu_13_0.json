However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that while it's not necessarily true that the toy is on the bookshelf, it's also not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box. The statement does not provide enough information to infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box based on the given information."
