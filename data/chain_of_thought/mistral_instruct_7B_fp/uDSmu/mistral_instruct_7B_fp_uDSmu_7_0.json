However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This means that the umbrella cannot be tucked away in the closet, but it could still be in the car. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say that the umbrella is not in the car, only that it cannot be tucked away in the closet. So, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car with absolute certainty, but we also cannot rule it out.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car with absolute certainty, but we also cannot rule it out."
