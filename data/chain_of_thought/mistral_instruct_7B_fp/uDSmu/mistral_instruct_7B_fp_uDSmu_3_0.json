It also tells us that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This means that while it's possible for the keys to be dangling, it's not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the keys are in the drawer. If the keys are in the drawer, then they are not dangling in the cabinet. Since it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, it follows that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
