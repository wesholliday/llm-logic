The second part of the statement, \"Also, it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" means that the remote control cannot be inferred to be hiding under the couch based on the given information. However, this does not mean that the remote control is on the coffee table. The statement only tells us that the remote control cannot be hiding under the couch, not that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
