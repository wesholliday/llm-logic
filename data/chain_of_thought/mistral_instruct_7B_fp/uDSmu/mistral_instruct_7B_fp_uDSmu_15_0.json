However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door. This means that the shoes cannot be lined up by the door, but they could still be in the closet. Since it's not stated or implied that the shoes are not in the closet, we cannot infer that they are not in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
