However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the notebook cannot be on the nightstand, but it does not necessarily mean that it's in the drawer. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\nAnswer:\nNo."
