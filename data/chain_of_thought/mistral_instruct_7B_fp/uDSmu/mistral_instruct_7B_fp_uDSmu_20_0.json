However, it is also stated that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head, but they could still be in her bag. Since we know that they cannot be perched on her head, and the only other option given to us is that they are in her bag, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
