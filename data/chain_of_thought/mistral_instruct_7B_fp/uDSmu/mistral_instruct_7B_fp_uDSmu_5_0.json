However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar. The statement only tells us that they cannot be hidden in the pantry, not where they are actually located.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar based on the given information."
