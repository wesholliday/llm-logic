The second part of the statement, \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" means that the pen is not necessarily on the desk, but it could still be in the bag. Since we know that the pen cannot be on the desk, and it cannot be both in the bag and on the desk at the same time, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
