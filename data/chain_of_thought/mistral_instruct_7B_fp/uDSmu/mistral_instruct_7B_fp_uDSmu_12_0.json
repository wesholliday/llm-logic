However, it's also stated that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, but it could still be draped over the chair. Since we know that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, and the only other option given to us is that the jacket is draped over the chair, we can infer that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
