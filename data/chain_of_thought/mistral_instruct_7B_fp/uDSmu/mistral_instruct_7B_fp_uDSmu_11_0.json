This means that the newspaper could be in the driveway, but it also could be on the porch. However, the statement does not exclude the possibility of the newspaper being in the driveway. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the newspaper is not in the driveway. Since we cannot infer that the newspaper is not in the driveway, we also cannot infer that the newspaper is in the driveway based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the newspaper is in the driveway."
