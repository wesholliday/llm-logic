However, it is also stated that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means that the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom, but it does not necessarily mean that the cat is napping on the couch. The statement only tells us what the cat cannot be doing, not what it is doing. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch."
