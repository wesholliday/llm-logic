In this case, the argument has a single premise and a conclusion, and the conclusion is a weaker version of the negation of the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake'. This means that it is not necessarily true that the vampire must have been awake. However, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire might not have been awake either. The conclusion 'The vampire might not have been awake' goes beyond what is logically implied by the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
