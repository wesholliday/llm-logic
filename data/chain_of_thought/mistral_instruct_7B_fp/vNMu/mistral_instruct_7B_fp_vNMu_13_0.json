In this case, the argument is an instance of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The form of modus tollens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn our case, the premise is 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box', which can be rewritten as 'It is not necessary that the toy is in the toy box' or 'It is possible that the toy is not in the toy box'. The conclusion is 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\nSo, the argument is in the form of modus tollens, and the premise and the conclusion have the same logical structure. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
