In other words, if the premise is true, does that mean the conclusion must also be true?\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza'. This means that it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza. However, this does not mean that she definitely did not choose pizza either. It only means that she is not obligated to have chosen pizza.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'. This statement is consistent with the premise. If it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza, then it is possible that she did not choose pizza. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion could also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
