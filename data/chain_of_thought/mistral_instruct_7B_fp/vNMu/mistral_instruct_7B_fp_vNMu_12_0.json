The denial of the inverse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'It's not the case that if P, then Q'. This can be logically equivalent to 'It's the case that P or not Q'.\n\nNow, let's break down the given argument:\n\n1. Premise: 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair'\n2. Conclusion: 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair'\n\nThe conclusion is the same as the negation of the premise's consequent. Since the argument is in the form of a denial of the inverse of a conditional statement, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
