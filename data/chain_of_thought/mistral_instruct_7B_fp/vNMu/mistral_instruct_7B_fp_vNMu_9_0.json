In this case, the argument has the following structure:\n\n1. It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n2. Therefore, Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nThe second premise is a logical consequence of the first, as 'it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' implies that it's possible for Lisa not to have bought the red shirt. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
