The conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the original conditional statement, 'The notebook might not be in the drawer'.\n\nIn a conditional argument, the logical form is: If P, then Q. Not-Q, therefore not-P.\n\nThe logical form of the given argument is: If the notebook is in the drawer, then it's not the case that the notebook might not be in the drawer. It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer, therefore the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' is indeed a logical consequence of the premise 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
