In other words, if the premise is true, does that mean the conclusion must also be true?\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball'. This means that Jeff does not have an obligation or necessity to have played basketball. However, this does not mean that Jeff definitely did not play basketball. It only means that he is not required to have played.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Jeff might not have played basketball'. This statement means that it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nSince the possibility that Jeff did not play basketball is consistent with the premise that he is not required to have played, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
