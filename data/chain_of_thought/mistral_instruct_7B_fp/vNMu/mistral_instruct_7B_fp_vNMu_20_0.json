In other words, if the premise is true, does that mean the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. Premise: It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n2. Conclusion: The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nExamining the argument, we can see that if the sunglasses do not have to be in her bag (premise), then it is possible that they are not in her bag (conclusion). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
