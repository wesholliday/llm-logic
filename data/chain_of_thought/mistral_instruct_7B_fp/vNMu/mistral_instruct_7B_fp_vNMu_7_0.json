In other words, if the premise is true, does it necessarily mean that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise: It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n2. Conclusion: Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nExamining the argument, we can see that if the premise is true, then it is possible that Alex did not finish the race. This is because the negation of 'Alex must have finished the race' implies that it is possible for Alex not to have finished the race. Therefore, the conclusion 'Alex might not have finished the race' follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
