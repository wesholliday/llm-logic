In other words, if the premise is true, does that mean the conclusion must also be true?\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars'. This means that it is not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars. However, this does not mean that the alien definitely did not visit Mars or that it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The alien might not have visited Mars'. This means that it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince the conclusion is a logical possibility given the premise, the argument is not logically invalid. However, it is also not logically valid because the premise does not necessarily imply the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid. While it is not logically invalid either, it does not follow that the conclusion logically follows from the premise."
