In this case, the argument is an instance of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The form of modus tollens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn our case, the premise is 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', which can be translated into 'If Mary must have been at the wedding, then something follows'. The conclusion is 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'.\n\nThe argument is valid because if it were not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding (premise), then it follows that she might not have been at the wedding (conclusion).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
