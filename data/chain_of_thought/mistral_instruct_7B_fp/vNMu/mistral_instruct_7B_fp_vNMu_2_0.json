            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe logical validity of an argument depends on whether its conclusion follows logically from its premises, given that the premises are true. In this case, the argument has the following structure:\n\n1. It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n2. Therefore, the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nThe second premise is a logical consequence of the first, as 'it's not the case that P must be true' implies 'P might not be true'. Therefore, if the first premise is true, then the second must also be true. However, the truth of the premises is not relevant to the logical validity of the argument.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the form of argument is logically valid."
