In this case, the argument is an instance of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The form of modus tollens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn our argument, the premise is 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag', which can be translated into 'If the pen is in my bag, then something is not the case'. The conclusion is 'The pen might not be in my bag'.\n\nSo, the question is whether 'The pen might not be in my bag' logically follows from 'If the pen is in my bag, then something is not the case'.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise. In other words, we need to check if it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nIf it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false, then the argument is not valid. If it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false, then the argument is valid.\n\nLet's check if it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nThe premise is 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag'. This means that it is not necessary for the pen to be in the bag. It could be in the bag, but it could also be somewhere else.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The pen might not be in my bag'. This means that it is possible for the pen to be somewhere else.\n\nSo, it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
