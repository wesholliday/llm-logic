This statement means that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement, 'If Q, then P', is not necessarily true. Just because the flug was zimmed, it does not mean that it was also blummed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
