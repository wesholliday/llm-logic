This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. However, this does not mean that if the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The statement 'If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked' is not a valid inference from 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'."
