This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is true, then P must also be true. This is known as the converse of a conditional statement, which is not always true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped' from 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'. The converse of a conditional statement is not always true."
