This type of statement does not necessarily imply that 'if Q, then P' is also true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement 'If it is raining, then the streets are wet'. This is true, but it does not mean that 'if the streets are wet, then it is raining' is also true. The streets can be wet for other reasons as well, such as a car driving through a puddle.\n\nSimilarly, in the given statement, 'the shank was plooked' does not necessarily mean that 'the shank was nugged' was the cause. Therefore, we cannot infer 'if the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
