This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not mean that if Q is true, then P must also be true. This is because the statement only establishes a one-way implication from P to Q, not from Q to P.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
