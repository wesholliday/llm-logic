However, this does not necessarily mean that if the splat quanked, then it was morphed. The statement 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed' is a reverse conditional statement, and without additional information, we cannot infer that it is true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed' based on the given statement."
