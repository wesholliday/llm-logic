This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement, 'If Q, then P', is not necessarily true. Just because the wug was garpled, it does not mean that it was sproonged. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the wug was garpled, then it was sproonged' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
