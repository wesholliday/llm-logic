Here, 'P' is 'the flugel was blimmed' and 'Q' is 'the flugel was zargled'. This type of statement means that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must also be true.\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement, 'If Q, then P', does not necessarily follow from the given statement. This is because the original statement does not imply that the consequence Q causes the condition P. It only implies that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
