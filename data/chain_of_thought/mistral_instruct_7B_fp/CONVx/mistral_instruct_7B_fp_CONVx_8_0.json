The contrapositive of 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'. However, the original statement does not imply that 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked'.\n\nThe statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' means that every time the sprocket was cranked, it was also daggled. But it does not mean that every time the sprocket was daggled, it was also cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
