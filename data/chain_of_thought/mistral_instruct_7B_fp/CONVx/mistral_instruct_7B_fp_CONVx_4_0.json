This statement is an implication, meaning that if the first condition (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second condition (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the fribble crinked does not mean that it was previously snurgled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
