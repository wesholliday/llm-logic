The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf being in the den) is also true. The second premise states that the consequence (the wolf being in the den) is indeed true.\n\nHowever, the given premises do not necessarily mean that the condition (the bear being in the cave) is also true. The conditional statement only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. It does not tell us that the bear is actually in the cave.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot logically infer 'The bear was in the cave'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
