            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first part of the conditional statement is also true. In other words, just because Jen watched basketball, it does not mean that Tom watched football. The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition. A sufficient condition would mean that if the first part is true, then the second part must be true, and if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot logically infer that 'Tom watched football'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
