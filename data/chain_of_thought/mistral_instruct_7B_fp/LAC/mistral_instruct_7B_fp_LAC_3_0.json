The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, which means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, the second statement 'The book is a mystery novel' does not necessarily mean that James wrote the book. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer 'The book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
