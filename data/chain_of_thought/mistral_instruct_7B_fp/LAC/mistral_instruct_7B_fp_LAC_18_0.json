It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. The second statement 'The truck was metal' tells us that the truck actually is made of metal.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the doll is plastic. The conditional statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. But it does not mean that if the truck is metal, then the doll is plastic. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The doll was plastic' based on 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
