            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement. It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. The second statement 'Chris finished the race' tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about the logic of conditional statements. A conditional statement has two parts: the 'if' part and the 'then' part. The 'if' part is a hypothesis, and the 'then' part is a consequence. If the hypothesis is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the hypothesis is 'Alex finished the race', and the consequence is 'Chris finished the race'. Since we know that 'Chris finished the race' is true (from the second statement), this means that the hypothesis 'Alex finished the race' must also be true, because the conditional statement tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished as well.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
