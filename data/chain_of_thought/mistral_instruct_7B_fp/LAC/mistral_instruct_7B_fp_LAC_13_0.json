In a conditional statement 'If P, then Q', P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion. If P is true, then Q must be true. If P is false, then Q can be true or false.\n\nIn this case, the given premises form a conditional statement, and the second premise 'The truck was blue' is a fact that confirms the conclusion 'the truck was blue' in the conditional statement. However, the first premise 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' does not provide any information about the truth value of 'The car was red'. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The car was red' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
