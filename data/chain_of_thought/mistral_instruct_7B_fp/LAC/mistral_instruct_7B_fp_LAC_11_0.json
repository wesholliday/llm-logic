It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, the cake must be chocolate.\n\nThe second statement 'The muffins were blueberry' tells us that the muffins indeed are blueberry. But it does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, it does not disprove the first statement either. However, it also does not provide enough information to confirm the first statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The cake was chocolate' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
