            "content": "Explanation:\nTo infer whether 'The apple was red' can be logically inferred from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow', we need to consider the structure of the given statements and the rules of logical inference.\n\nThe first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. The second statement 'The banana was yellow' is a factual statement that asserts that the banana is yellow.\n\nTo infer 'The apple was red' from these two statements, we would need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q' and 'P' is true, then 'Q' must be true. However, in this case, we only have the fact that 'Q' (banana was yellow) is true, but we do not have enough information to infer that 'P' (apple was red) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer 'The apple was red'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
