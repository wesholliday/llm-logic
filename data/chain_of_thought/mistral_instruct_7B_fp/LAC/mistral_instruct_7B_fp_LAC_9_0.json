            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nTo infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to check if the first part of the conditional statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true or false, given that the second part (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.\n\nExplanation for 'Yes':\nSince we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (second statement), and the conditional statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that Lisa must have bought the red shirt as well. This is because the second part of the conditional statement (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, and the conditional statement tells us that the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) must be true as well, in order for the second part to be true. Therefore, we can logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt."
