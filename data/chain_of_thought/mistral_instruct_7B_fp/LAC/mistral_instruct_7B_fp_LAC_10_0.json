This is a logical implication, not a guarantee.\n\nThe second premise 'The cat was outside' tells us that the cat is indeed outside.\n\nNow, we need to check if the first premise holds true given the second premise. Since the cat is outside, it means that the dog cannot be inside (according to the first premise). Therefore, the first premise holds true given the second premise.\n\nHowever, the logical inference from 'The cat was outside' to 'The dog was inside' is not valid. The given premises only allow us to infer that 'The dog was not inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot logically infer 'The dog was inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' and 'The cat was outside'. We can only infer that 'The dog was not inside'."
