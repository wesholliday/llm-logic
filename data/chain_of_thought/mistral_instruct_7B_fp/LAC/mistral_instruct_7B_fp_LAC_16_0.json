This is a conditional statement, meaning if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. The second statement given is 'The pants were denim'. This statement tells us that the pants indeed are denim, but it does not provide any information about the shirt.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, it does not disprove the first statement either. However, the second statement alone does not provide enough information to confirm that the shirt is cotton. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The shirt was cotton' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
