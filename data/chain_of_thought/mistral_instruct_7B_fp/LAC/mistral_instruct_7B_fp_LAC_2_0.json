(Let's call this Premise 2.)\n\nTo infer 'The griffin was in the forest', we need to determine if it follows logically from Premise 1 and Premise 2.\n\nIn order to do this, we can use the method of direct instantiation, which involves substituting a specific instance for the variables in the conditional statement. In this case, the variable is 'griffin' in Premise 1 and 'unicorn' in Premise 2.\n\nSince Premise 2 tells us that the unicorn is in the forest, we can substitute 'unicorn' for 'x' in Premise 1 to get:\n\n1'. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (This is the same as Premise 1.)\n2'. The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nNow, we can see that Premise 1' and Premise 2' form a valid conditional statement, and Premise 2' is true. Since the conditional statement is true, its consequent (the second part) must also be true. In this case, the consequent is 'the unicorn was in the forest', which we know is true from Premise 2'.\n\nHowever, to infer 'The griffin was in the forest', we need to find a specific instance that makes the entire conditional statement true. In this case, since Premise 2' tells us that the unicorn is in the forest, we can infer that the griffin must also be in the forest, as stated in Premise 1'.\n\nTherefore, 'The griffin was in the forest' follows logically from 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' and 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
