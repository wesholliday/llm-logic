            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nTo determine if 'The apple was red' is true, we need to check if the first part of the conditional statement (the apple being red) is consistent with the second statement given (the banana being yellow). If the apple being red is consistent with the banana being yellow, then it is reasonable to infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.\n\nExplanation for 'Yes':\nGiven that 'The banana was yellow' is true, this means that the second part of the conditional statement is true. Since the conditional statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', and the second part is true, it means that the first part (the apple being red) must also be consistent with the second part being true. In other words, the apple being red must also be true. Therefore, 'The apple was red' is also true."
