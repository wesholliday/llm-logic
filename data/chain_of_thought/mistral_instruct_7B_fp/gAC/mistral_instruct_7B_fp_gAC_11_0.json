This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The muffins were blueberry'. This means that the condition in the first statement is true (the muffins are blueberry), but it does not necessarily mean that the cake is also chocolate. The truth of the first statement (the cake being chocolate) cannot be determined based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'The cake was chocolate' is true."
