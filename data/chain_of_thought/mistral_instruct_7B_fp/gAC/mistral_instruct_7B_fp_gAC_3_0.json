We are given that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true. This is an if-then statement, also known as a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the book was written by James) is true, then the second part (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true.\n2. We are also given that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true. This means that the book meets the criteria for being a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's see if we can use this information to deduce that 'The book was written by James' is true:\n\n1. Since 'The book is a mystery novel' is true, and we know that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is also true, it follows that 'The book was written by James' must be true as well. This is because the only way for the book to be a mystery novel is if it was written by James.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
