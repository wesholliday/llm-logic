            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true. The second given statement is 'The truck was blue'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true. However, the first part of the conditional statement, 'The car was red', is not given as true. Therefore, even though the truck being blue implies that the car was red, we cannot conclude that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'The car was red' is true."
