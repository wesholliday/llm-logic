This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Kate ate salad'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n1. The first statement tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n2. The second statement tells us that Kate did indeed eat salad.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us anything about whether Ben ate pasta or not. It only tells us that if he did, then Kate would also eat salad. Since we know that Kate ate salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben also ate pasta.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'Ben ate pasta' is true."
