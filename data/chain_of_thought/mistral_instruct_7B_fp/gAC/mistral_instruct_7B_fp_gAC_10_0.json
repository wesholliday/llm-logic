            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the dog being inside) is true, then the second part (the cat being outside) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The cat was outside'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the first part of the conditional statement is not given. The statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' does not guarantee that the dog was actually inside. It only states that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside.\n\nTherefore, even though we know that the cat was outside, we cannot conclude that the dog was inside based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'The dog was inside' is true."
