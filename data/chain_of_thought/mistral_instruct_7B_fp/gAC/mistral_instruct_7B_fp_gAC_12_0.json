This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. This means that Lucy did indeed go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. It only states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The fact that Lucy went to the zoo does not automatically mean that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that 'Joe went to the park'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
