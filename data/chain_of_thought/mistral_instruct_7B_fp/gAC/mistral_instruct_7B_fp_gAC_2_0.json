The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. The second statement is a fact, stating that the unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\nTo determine if 'The griffin was in the forest' is true, we need to consider the given information. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, it means that if the condition (griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequence (unicorn being in the forest) is also true. And we know that the consequence is true (unicorn is in the forest) from the second statement. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the condition (griffin being in the forest) is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
