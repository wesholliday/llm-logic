This means that the condition in the first statement (the bear being in the cave) is not necessarily false, but it is also not necessarily true. We cannot conclude that the bear is in the cave based on this information alone, as the first statement only establishes a relationship between the bear and the wolf, not that the bear is definitely in the cave.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'The bear was in the cave' is true."
