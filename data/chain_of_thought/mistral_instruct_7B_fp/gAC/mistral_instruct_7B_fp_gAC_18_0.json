This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true. The second given statement is 'The truck was metal'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any information about the first part of the conditional statement, which is 'The doll was plastic'. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether 'The doll was plastic' is true or false based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot determine whether 'The doll was plastic' is true or false based on the given information."
