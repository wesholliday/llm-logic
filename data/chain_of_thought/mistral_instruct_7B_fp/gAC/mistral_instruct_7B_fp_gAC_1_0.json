This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nSince the second part of the conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement is of the form 'If P, then Q', it follows that P (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
