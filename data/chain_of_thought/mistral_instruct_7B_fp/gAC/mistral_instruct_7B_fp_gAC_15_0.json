This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Erin took a train'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information. The second statement tells us that Erin did take a train. According to the first statement, if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since we know that Erin took a train, it means that the condition in the first statement must be true as well. Therefore, it follows that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
