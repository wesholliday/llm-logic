            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. This means that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, to determine if the first part of the conditional statement is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), we can use the given information. Since the second part of the conditional statement is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), and the conditional statement is of the form 'If A, then B', we can infer that A must also be true. This is known as the modus ponens rule in logic.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
