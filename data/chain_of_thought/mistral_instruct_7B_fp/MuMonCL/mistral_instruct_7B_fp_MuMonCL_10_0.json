            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The document must have been signed and notarized' implies that both signing and notarization are necessary conditions for the document to meet the requirement. However, 'and' in this context indicates that both conditions must be met for the document to be valid. Therefore, while signing is a necessary condition for notarization (as a document cannot be notarized unless it is first signed), it does not follow that 'The document must have been signed' can be inferred from 'The document must have been signed and notarized'.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The document must have been signed' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized'."
