However, the statement does not necessarily mean that updating the software is a sufficient condition for the current situation. In other words, it is possible that the software was updated but not restarted, or that the software was not updated but was restarted for some other reason. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The software must have been updated' from 'The software must have been updated and restarted'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
