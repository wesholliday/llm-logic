However, it does not explicitly state that the length requirement is independent of the number requirement. Therefore, while it is possible that the password must be eight characters long, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The password must have been eight characters long' from the given statement."
