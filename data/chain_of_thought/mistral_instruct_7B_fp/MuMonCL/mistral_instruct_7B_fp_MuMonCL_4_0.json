            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room' contains two parts connected by 'and'. The first part is 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM', and the second part is 'in the conference room'. To infer whether the first part is necessarily true, we need to consider if the second part depends on the first part. In this case, the second part does not depend on the first part. Therefore, 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM' is a part of the original statement that can stand alone, and we can infer that 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
