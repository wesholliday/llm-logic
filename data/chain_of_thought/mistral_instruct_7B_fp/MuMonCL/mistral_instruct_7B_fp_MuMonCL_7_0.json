            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters' implies that the exam was challenging and it covered material from all chapters. However, the phrase 'and covered all chapters' is not necessary to infer that the exam was difficult. The statement 'The exam must have been difficult' can be inferred from the first part of the original statement, 'The exam must have been difficult'. Therefore, while the full statement implies that the exam was difficult and covered all chapters, the statement 'The exam must have been difficult' can be inferred from the first part of the statement alone.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
