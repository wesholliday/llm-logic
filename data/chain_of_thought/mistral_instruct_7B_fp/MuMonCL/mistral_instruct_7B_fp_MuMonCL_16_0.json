            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels' implies two things about the room. The first part, 'The room must have been cleaned daily', suggests that the room is cleaned every day. The second part, 'had fresh towels', indicates that the towels in the room were replaced daily as well. Since the statement mentions that the room is cleaned daily, it implies that this is a necessary condition for having fresh towels. Therefore, based on the information given, it is reasonable to infer that 'The room must have been cleaned daily'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
