            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed' implies that the envelope is located in a specific area, which is upstairs and under a bed. However, it does not necessarily mean that the envelope is only in that exact location. It could be that the envelope is only upstairs, but not under a bed, or it could be under a bed, but not necessarily upstairs. But it is definitely upstairs, as stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
