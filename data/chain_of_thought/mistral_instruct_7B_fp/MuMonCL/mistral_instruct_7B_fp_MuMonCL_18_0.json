However, the first part 'The medicine must have been taken with food' is not directly implied by the given statement. The given statement only tells us that it was taken with food at least once, but it does not specify if it was taken with food both times. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The medicine must have been taken with food' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
