Since the statement includes the possibility of the exam being difficult, it means that we cannot rule out this possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The exam might be difficult' with absolute certainty, but we can say that it is a possible outcome based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it is a possible outcome."
