            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled' means that there are two possibilities for the meeting: it could be at 2 PM, or it could be cancelled. The 'or' here indicates that these are mutually exclusive options, meaning that if the meeting is at 2 PM, then it cannot be cancelled at the same time. However, the statement does not guarantee that the meeting will definitely be at 2 PM. It only tells us that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, while it is possible that the meeting might be at 2 PM, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The meeting might be at 2 PM' from 'The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled'."
