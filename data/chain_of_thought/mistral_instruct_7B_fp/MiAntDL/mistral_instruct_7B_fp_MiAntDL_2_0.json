This statement does not exclude the possibility that the book is on the shelf, but it also does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, while it is possible that the book is on the shelf, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book might be on the shelf' from 'The book might be on the shelf or in the library'."
