However, the statement does not explicitly specify that the contract is definitely valid for a year. Therefore, while it is possible that the contract is valid for a year, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The contract might be valid for a year' from the given statement."
