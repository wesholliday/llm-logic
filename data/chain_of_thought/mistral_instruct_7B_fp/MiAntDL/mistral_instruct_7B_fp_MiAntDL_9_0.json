            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' suggests that there are two possible outcomes for the flight: it might be delayed, or it might be on time. This means that the flight could potentially be delayed. However, the statement does not necessarily mean that the flight will be delayed, only that it is one of the possible outcomes. Therefore, while we can infer that 'The flight might be delayed' is a possibility, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The flight might be delayed' is true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flight might be delayed' with certainty based on the given statement."
