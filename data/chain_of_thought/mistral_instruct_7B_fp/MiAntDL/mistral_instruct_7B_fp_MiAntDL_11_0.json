One is that it might be updated, and the other is that it might be reinstalled. While the statement does not explicitly state that the software will be updated, it does imply that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say that the software will be updated, but we can infer that it might be.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer that 'The software might be updated'."
