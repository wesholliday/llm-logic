This means that the project could be completed by Friday, but it also means that it could be extended. Therefore, while it is possible that the project might be completed by Friday, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The project might be completed by Friday' based on the given information."
