However, the statement does not necessarily mean that the flight was only rerouted and not delayed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flight must have been rerouted' from this statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the flight was only rerouted and not delayed based on the given statement."
