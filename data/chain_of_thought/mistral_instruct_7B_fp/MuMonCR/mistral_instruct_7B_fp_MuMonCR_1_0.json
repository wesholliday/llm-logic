            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed' implies that the envelope is in a specific location, which is both upstairs and under a bed. However, the statement does not necessarily mean that the envelope is only under a bed. It could be that the envelope is also somewhere else upstairs, but it is also under a bed. Therefore, while the envelope is under a bed, we cannot infer that it must only be under a bed based on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
