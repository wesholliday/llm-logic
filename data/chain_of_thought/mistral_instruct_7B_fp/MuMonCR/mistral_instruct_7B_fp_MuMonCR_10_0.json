            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The document must have been signed and notarized' implies that both signing and notarization are necessary conditions for the document to be valid. However, the phrase 'The document must have been notarized' only implies that notarization is a necessary condition. Therefore, while it is true that if the document was notarized, it must have been signed as well, the converse is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The document must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized' without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The document must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized' without additional information."
