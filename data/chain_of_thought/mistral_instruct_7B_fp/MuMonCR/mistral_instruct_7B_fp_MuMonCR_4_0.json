            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room' contains two separate pieces of information. The first part is 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM', which refers to the time of the meeting. The second part is 'in the conference room', which refers to the location of the meeting. To infer that 'The meeting must have been in the conference room' from the original statement, we need to ensure that the location information is not dependent on the time information. In this case, the location information 'in the conference room' is not dependent on the time information 'at 2 PM'. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The meeting must have been in the conference room'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
