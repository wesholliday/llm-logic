The first clause states that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, and the second clause states that the restaurant served Italian cuisine.\n\nTo infer that 'The restaurant must have served Italian cuisine' from the given statement, we need to consider whether the second clause is a necessary condition for the first clause to be true. In other words, does the fact that the restaurant was closed on Mondays depend on it serving Italian cuisine?\n\nThe answer is no, the fact that the restaurant was closed on Mondays does not depend on it serving Italian cuisine. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The restaurant must have served Italian cuisine' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
