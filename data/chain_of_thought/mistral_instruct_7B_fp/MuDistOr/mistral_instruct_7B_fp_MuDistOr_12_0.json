However, the phrase 'or' in the original statement implies that at least one of the two conditions must be true, but it does not exclude the possibility that both conditions could be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the software must be either installed on the computer or it must be accessed through the cloud, as it could be both.\n\nAnswer: No."
