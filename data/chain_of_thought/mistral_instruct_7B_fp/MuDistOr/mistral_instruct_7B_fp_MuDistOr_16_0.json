However, the word 'or' in this context means that one condition or the other must be met, but not necessarily both. Therefore, we cannot infer that the contract must be approved by both the legal team and the CEO based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the contract must be approved by both the legal team and the CEO."
