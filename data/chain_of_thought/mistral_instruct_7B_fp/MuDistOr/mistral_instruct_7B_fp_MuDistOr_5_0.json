This statement is inclusive, meaning it includes both possibilities.\n\nWhen we rephrase the statement to 'The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday', we are making it exclusive, meaning only one of the two possibilities can be true. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to support this exclusive interpretation. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday' from 'The meeting must have been on Monday or Tuesday'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
