            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop\" is a disjunction, meaning it includes two possibilities: the car being in the garage or the car being at the repair shop. The revised statement \"The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop\" adds an additional possibility, which is not supported by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer this revised statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
