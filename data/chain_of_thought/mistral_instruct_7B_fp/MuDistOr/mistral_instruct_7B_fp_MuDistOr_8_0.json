However, the 'or' in this statement implies that at least one of the conditions must be met, not necessarily both. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must be signed and notarized based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that 'The document must have been signed and notarized'. The original statement only requires that the document be signed or notarized, not both."
