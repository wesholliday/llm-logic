It means that if the whiffle was shanked (hit poorly, often resulting in a high, weak shot), then it would have made the tink sound.\n\nHowever, this statement does not mean that the whiffle was definitely shanked. It only means that if it was shanked, then it would have made the tink sound. The statement does not provide enough information to infer that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The whiffle was shanked' based on the given information."
