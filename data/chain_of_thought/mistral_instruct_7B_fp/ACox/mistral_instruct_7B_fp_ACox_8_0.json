            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The sprocket was daggled' means that the sprocket was in a certain state or position. The second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket is cranked, then it will be in the daggled state. However, this statement does not mean that the sprocket is currently cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was cranked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
