However, the given statements only provide information about the relationship between 'The flugel was blimmed' and 'The flugel was zargled' through the implication 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'. This statement implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have also been zargled, but it does not mean that the flugel was blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was blimmed' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
