This would mean that the condition 'The fribble was snurgled' must have been true.\n\nHowever, the given information only states that 'The fribble crinkled' and 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinkled'. It does not provide any information about whether 'The fribble was snurgled' actually happened. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was snurgled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
