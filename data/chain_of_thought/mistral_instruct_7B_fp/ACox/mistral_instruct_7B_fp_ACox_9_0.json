The second statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, this statement does not mean that the twonk was plinked, only that if it was, then it would have been varnished. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was plinked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
