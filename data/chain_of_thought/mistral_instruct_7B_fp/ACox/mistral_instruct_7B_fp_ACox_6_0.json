The second statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement that states that if the grommet was sploffed (whatever that means in this context), then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The grommet was sploffed' from these two statements alone. The conditional statement does not mean that the grommet was sploffed, it only means that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. It does not mean that the grommet was actually sploffed.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
