The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanked) is also true. However, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the splat was morphed. It only states that the splat quanked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was morphed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
