This second statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the wug was sproinged, then it was also garpled. However, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the wug was sproinged. It only states that the wug was garpled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was sproinged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
