The second statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' is a conditional statement that means if the zinger is fraggled, then it must have been smoogled as well. However, the statement does not mean that the zinger is fraggled. It only means that if it is fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The zinger was fraggled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
