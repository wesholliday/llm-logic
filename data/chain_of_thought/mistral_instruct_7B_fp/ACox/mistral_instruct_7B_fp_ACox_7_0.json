The second statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' is a conditional statement that means if the whiffle was shanked, then it would make a tinkling sound. However, this statement does not mean that the whiffle was actually shanked. It only means that if it was shanked, then it would make that sound. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle was shanked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
