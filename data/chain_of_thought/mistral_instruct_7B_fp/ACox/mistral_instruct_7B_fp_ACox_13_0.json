The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat was morphed, then it was also quanked.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any information about whether the splat was actually morphed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was morphed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
