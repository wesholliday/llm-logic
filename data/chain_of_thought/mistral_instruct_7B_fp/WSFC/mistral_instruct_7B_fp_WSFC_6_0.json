The phrase 'might arrive' indicates that there is uncertainty about the exact day. When we say 'The package might arrive on Monday and it might arrive on Tuesday', we are simply repeating the same information in a different way, stating that both days are possibilities. Since the original statement and the new statement mean the same thing, we can infer that 'The package might arrive on Monday and it might arrive on Tuesday' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
