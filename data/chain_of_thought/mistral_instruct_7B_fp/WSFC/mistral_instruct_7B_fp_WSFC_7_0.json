The phrase 'might win or might lose' is a way of expressing this dual possibility.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer 'The team might win the match and they might lose the match'. This is essentially saying the same thing as the original statement, but in a different order. Since the original statement already implies that both outcomes are possible, it follows that we can infer 'The team might win the match and they might lose the match'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
