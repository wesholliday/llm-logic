This means that both winning and losing are possibilities for the candidate.\n\nNow, the phrase 'The candidate might win the election and they might lose the election' is simply stating the same two possibilities in a different way. Since both winning and losing are already established as possibilities in the original statement, there is no new information being added in this phrase. Therefore, the original statement and the new phrase are equivalent and mean the same thing.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer 'The candidate might win the election and they might lose the election' from 'The candidate might win or they might lose the election'."
