This means that both outcomes are possible.\n\nTo infer 'The flight might be delayed and it might be on time', we would be saying that both outcomes are possible at the same time. However, this is not logically possible, as a flight can only be in one state at a given time (either delayed or on time). Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flight might be delayed and it might be on time' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
