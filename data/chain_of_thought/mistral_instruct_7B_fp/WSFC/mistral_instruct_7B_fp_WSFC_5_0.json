However, the statement does not explicitly state that she might study both. Therefore, while it is possible that Sarah might study both biology and chemistry, we cannot infer this from the given information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Sarah might study biology and she might study chemistry' based on the original statement."
