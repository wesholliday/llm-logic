'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'\n\nThe first statement tells us that the cake is not chocolate. The second statement is a conditional statement, meaning it tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. However, it does not tell us anything about the muffins if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nSince we know that the cake is not chocolate, we cannot directly infer that the muffins are not blueberry based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The muffins were not blueberry' from the given statements."
