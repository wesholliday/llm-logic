This means that the shirt is made of some material other than cotton.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim. However, since we know that the shirt is not cotton, we cannot make any conclusions about the pants being denim based on this statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The pants were not denim' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
