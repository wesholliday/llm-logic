The second statement is an if-then statement: 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nThe if-then statement means that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequence (the unicorn being in the forest) is also true. However, since we know that the condition is false (the griffin is not in the forest), the consequence does not have to be true. But it also does not mean that the consequence is false. The information given does not allow us to infer that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest' based on the given information."
