The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate ate salad) is also true. However, the condition is not true in this case (Ben did not eat pasta), so we cannot conclude that the consequence is true either (Kate did not eat salad as a direct result of Ben not eating pasta).\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that Kate did eat salad either, because the conditional statement does not guarantee that if the condition is false, the consequence must also be false. It only tells us that if the condition is true, the consequence is also true.\n\nSo, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about Kate's salad consumption based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Kate did not eat salad'."
