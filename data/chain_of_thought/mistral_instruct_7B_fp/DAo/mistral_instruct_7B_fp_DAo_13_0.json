The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, the statement does not tell us anything about the truck's color if the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
