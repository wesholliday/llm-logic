The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) is also true. However, since we know that the condition is false (the dog is not inside), we cannot automatically conclude that the consequence is also false (the cat is not outside).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The cat was not outside' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
