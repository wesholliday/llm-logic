The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if Tom watched football, then Jen would watch basketball. However, the statement does not tell us anything about what Jen actually did if Tom did not watch football.\n\nSince the statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, it does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
