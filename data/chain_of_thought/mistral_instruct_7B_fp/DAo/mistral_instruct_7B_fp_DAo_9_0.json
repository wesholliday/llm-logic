It means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, since we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot make any conclusions about Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
