If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park. Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot automatically assume that the second part is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question:\nThe question asks if we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given statements.\n\nSince we cannot infer that Lucy went to the zoo from the given statements (because Joe did not go to the park), it would also be incorrect to infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is because the given statements do not provide enough information to make such a conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from 'Joe did not go to the park' and 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'."
