This means that James did not write the book.\nThe second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) is also true.\nHowever, since we know that the condition is not true (the book was not written by James), we cannot infer that the consequence is also not true. In other words, just because James did not write the book, it does not mean that the book cannot be a mystery novel.\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
