The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, since we know that the condition is false (Mary is not at the wedding), we cannot conclude that the consequence is true (Sue is at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
