'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.'\n\nThe first statement tells us that the apple is not red. The second statement is a conditional statement, meaning it has an 'if' clause and a 'then' clause. The 'if' clause is 'if the apple was red,' and the 'then' clause is 'then the banana was yellow.'\n\nHowever, since we know that the apple is not red, the 'if' clause of the conditional statement does not hold true. This means that we cannot automatically assume that the 'then' clause is also true. In other words, just because the apple is not red, it does not mean that the banana is not yellow.\n\nSo, can we infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements? No, we cannot.\n\nAnswer: No."
