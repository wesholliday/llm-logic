            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The bear was not in the cave' means that the bear is not present in the cave. The second statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf being in the den) is also true. However, since the condition is false (the bear is not in the cave), the consequence does not have to be true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wolf was not in the den' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
