            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The doll was not plastic' tells us that the doll is made of some material other than plastic. The second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would be metal. However, since we know that the doll is not plastic, we cannot use this conditional statement to make a conclusion about the truck. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not metal' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
