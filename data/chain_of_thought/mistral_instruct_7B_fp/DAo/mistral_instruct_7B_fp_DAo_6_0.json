The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, since we know that Sue did not choose pizza, the condition in the second statement does not apply. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Bob's choice based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Bob did not choose pasta'."
