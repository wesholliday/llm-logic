            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe first statement 'The vampire was not awake' means that the vampire is in a state of sleep or unconsciousness. The second statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement that suggests that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, since the vampire is not awake, the condition in the conditional statement does not hold true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the mummy is also not awake based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The mummy was not awake' from 'The vampire was not awake' and 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'."
