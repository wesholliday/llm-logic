The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if a certain condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then another event (Chris finishing the race) is also true.\n\nHowever, since we know that the first condition (Alex finishing the race) is false, the conditional statement does not apply. Therefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
