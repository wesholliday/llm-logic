            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a contrapositive of the original premise. In logic, a contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nThe original argument is in the form 'If P then not Q', where P is 'the issue was discussed' and Q is 'the issue was not discussed in depth'.\n\nThe contrapositive argument is 'If not Q then not P', which translates to 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then the issue was not discussed'.\n\nHowever, the contrapositive of a valid argument is not necessarily valid itself. The validity of an argument depends on the truth of its premises, not just the form of the argument.\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to check if its premise is true. But without more information, it's impossible to say whether the premise 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth' is true or false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nI'm unable to determine the validity of the argument based on the information provided."
