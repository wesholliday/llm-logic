            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a contrapositive argument, which means that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. In logical terms, the contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nHowever, for an argument to be logically valid, its premises must be true and the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the argument's premise is 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly'. This premise is not necessarily false, but it is also not necessarily true. It depends on the specific context and definition of 'cleaned thoroughly'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned' is logically contradictory. A room cannot be both cleaned thoroughly and not cleaned at the same time. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion does not follow logically from its premise, even if the premise were true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
