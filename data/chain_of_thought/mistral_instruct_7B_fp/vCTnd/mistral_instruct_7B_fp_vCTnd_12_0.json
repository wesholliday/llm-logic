In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If Jane studied, then she did not study long (P implies Q)\n2. If Jane studied long, then she did not study (Q implies not-P)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where both the premise and the conclusion are false:\n\n1. Jane studied for a short time (P is true)\n2. Jane studied long (Q is also true)\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the argument's conclusion is false, as Jane studied long, which contradicts the argument's conclusion that if Jane studied long, then she did not study.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as its conclusion does not necessarily follow from its premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
