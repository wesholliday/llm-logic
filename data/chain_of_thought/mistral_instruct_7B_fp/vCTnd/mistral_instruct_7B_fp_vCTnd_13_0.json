If Q, then not P (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use the method of contraposition. The contrapositive of the first conditional statement is:\n\nIf not Q, then not P\n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion of the argument with the contrapositive of the premise:\n\n1. If Q, then not P (Conclusion)\n2. If not Q, then not P (Contrapositive of Premise)\n\nSince the conclusion and the contrapositive of the premise are identical, the argument is logically equivalent. Therefore, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise is logically valid.\n\nThe premise 'If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much' is a contradiction, as it asserts that two opposite statements are both true at the same time. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because its premise is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
