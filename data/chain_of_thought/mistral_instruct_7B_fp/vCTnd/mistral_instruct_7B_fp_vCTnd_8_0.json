In logic, a contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nThe original argument is 'If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively'. The contrapositive of this argument is 'If the issue was not addressed effectively, then it was not addressed'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the given argument is 'If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed'. This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather its negation.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
