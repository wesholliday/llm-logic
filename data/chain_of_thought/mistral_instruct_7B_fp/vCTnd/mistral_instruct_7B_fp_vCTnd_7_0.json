In logical terms, the contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nHowever, for an argument to be logically valid, its premises must be true and the conclusion must logically follow from the premises. In this case, the premise 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly' is a contradiction, as it cannot be both true and false at the same time. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because its premise is not a valid statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
