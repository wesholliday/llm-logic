            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a contrapositive argument, which means that if the conclusion of an argument is 'P implies not Q', then the contrapositive argument is 'not Q implies not P'. In this case, the premise is 'If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly', which means 'Washed implies not Properly washed'. The conclusion is 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed', which means 'Properly washed implies not Washed'.\n\nHowever, for an argument to be logically valid, its conclusion must follow logically from its premises. In this case, the conclusion 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed' does not follow logically from the premise 'If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly'. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
