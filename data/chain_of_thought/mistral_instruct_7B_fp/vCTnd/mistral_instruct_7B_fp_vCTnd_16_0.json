In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P implies Q' is 'not Q implies not P'.\n\nThe original statement is 'If the job was completed, then it was not completed well'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the job was not completed well, then it was not completed'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument is 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed'. This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather its negation.\n\nThe negation of a conditional statement 'P implies Q' is 'not P or not Q'. In this case, the negation would be 'The job was not completed or it was not completed well'.\n\nSince the conclusion does not match either the original statement or its contrapositive, and it does not match the negation of the original statement either, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
