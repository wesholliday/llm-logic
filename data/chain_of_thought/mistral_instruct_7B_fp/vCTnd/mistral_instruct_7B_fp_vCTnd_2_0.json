The form of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\nP: If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\nC: If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's consider a truth table for this argument:\n\n| Ann exercised | Ann exercised strenuously | P (If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously) | C (If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise) |\n|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| True          | True                       | False                                                      | False                                                      |\n| True          | False                      | True                                                      | True                                                      |\n| False         | True                       | False                                                      | True                                                      |\n| False         | False                      | True                                                      | False                                                      |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.
