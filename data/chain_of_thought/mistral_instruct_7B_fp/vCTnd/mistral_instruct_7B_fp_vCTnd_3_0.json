However, for a contrapositive argument to be logically valid, the original conditional statement 'P implies Q' must be true.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal'. This statement is not necessarily true. It could be that eating a meal and eating a large meal are two separate possibilities. Therefore, the contrapositive argument 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal' is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
