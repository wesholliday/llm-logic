In logical terms, the contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If the room was not tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument is 'If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied'. This is not the contrapositive of the premise, but rather its negation.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion does not follow logically from its premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
