The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original premise is 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If I did not buy vegetables, then I did not go to the store'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument is 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'. This is not the contrapositive of the original premise, but rather the negation of the original premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
