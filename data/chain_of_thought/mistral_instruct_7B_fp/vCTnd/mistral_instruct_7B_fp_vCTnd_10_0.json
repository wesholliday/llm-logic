            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement with two contrapositives. A contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In this case, the original conditional statement is 'If advice was offered, then it was not helpful advice'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If it was not the case that advice was not helpful, then it was not the case that advice was offered'. This can be rephrased as 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered'.\n\nHowever, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement if and only if the original statement is a tautology or a contradiction. A tautology is a statement that is always true, and a contradiction is a statement that is always false. In this case, the original statement 'If advice was offered, then it was not helpful advice' is not a tautology or a contradiction, but rather a false statement. Therefore, its contrapositive 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' is also a false statement.\n\nSince the argument's conclusion is a false statement, the argument is not logically valid. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion follows logically from the premises, and if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the premise is false, and even if it were true, the conclusion would still be false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
