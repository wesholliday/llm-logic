In logic, a contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nThe original premise is 'If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If it was not the case that a recommendation was not made, then it was not the case that it was not a strong recommendation'. This can be simplified to 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was made'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given in the question is 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. This is the opposite of the contrapositive of the original premise, not the contrapositive itself.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
