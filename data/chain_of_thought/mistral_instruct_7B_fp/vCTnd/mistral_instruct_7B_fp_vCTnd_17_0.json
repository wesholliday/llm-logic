In this case, the original conditional statement is 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the customer was not greeted warmly, then they were not greeted'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument is 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted'. This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather the negation of the original statement. The negation of 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly' is 'If the customer was not greeted, then they were greeted warmly or not greeted warmly', which is not equivalent to the conclusion of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
