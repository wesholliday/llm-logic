In this case, the original argument is 'If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly'. The contrapositive argument is 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original argument. This means that if the original argument is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nLet's break down the original argument:\n1. If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\n\nThis statement suggests that providing directions and explaining them clearly are mutually exclusive. However, it does not necessarily mean that if directions are explained clearly, then they were not provided.\n\nNow let's break down the contrapositive argument:\n1. If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\n\nThis statement suggests that explaining directions clearly and providing directions are also mutually exclusive. However, this is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive argument is not logically equivalent to the original argument, and the original argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
