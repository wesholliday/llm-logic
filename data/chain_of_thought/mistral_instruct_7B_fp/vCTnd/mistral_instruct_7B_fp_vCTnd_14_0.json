In logical terms, the contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nHowever, for an argument to be logically valid, its conclusion must follow logically from its premises. In this case, the conclusion 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared' is the contrapositive of the premise 'If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully'.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the contrapositive does not necessarily follow from the original premise. The fact that the meal was not prepared carefully does not logically imply that the meal was not prepared at all. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
