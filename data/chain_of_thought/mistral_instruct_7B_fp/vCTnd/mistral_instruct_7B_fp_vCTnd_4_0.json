Therefore, if Q (Ben studied diligently), then not-P\n\nThis argument is a contrapositive argument, which means that if the conclusion of a conditional statement is not-P, then the contrapositive of the original statement is not-Q if-P.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is not-P if-Q, which is the contrapositive of the premise. Since the premise is a conditional statement, and its contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
