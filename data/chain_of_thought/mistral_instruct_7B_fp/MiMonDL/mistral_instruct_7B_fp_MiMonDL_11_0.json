However, this does not exclude the possibility of other weather conditions, such as rain. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that 'The weather might be sunny or rainy', we cannot also definitively rule it out based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The weather might be sunny or rainy' directly from 'The weather might be sunny'. However, it does not mean that it is impossible. The original statement only suggests that the weather might be sunny, and it does not exclude the possibility of other weather conditions. Therefore, while we cannot infer 'The weather might be sunny or rainy' directly, we cannot also definitively rule it out based on the given information. It would require additional information to make a more definitive statement."
