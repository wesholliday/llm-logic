If we want to include 'The cat might be playing' as a possibility, we need a reason to believe that the cat could be playing while also sleeping. However, without additional information, we cannot assume that the cat is both sleeping and playing at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cat might be sleeping or playing' from 'The cat might be sleeping' alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
