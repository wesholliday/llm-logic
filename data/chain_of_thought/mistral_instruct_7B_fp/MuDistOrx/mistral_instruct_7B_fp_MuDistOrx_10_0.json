The 'or be' part is a shorthand for 'or it must be'. So, if we break down the original statement, we can see that it is already saying 'The flibbit must be snork' or 'it must be bimboozle'. Therefore, the statement 'The flibbit must be snork or it must be bimboozle' is logically equivalent to the original statement and does not provide any new information.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, the two statements are logically equivalent."
