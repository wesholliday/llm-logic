            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two alternatives that are mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive. In other words, it means that the blimp must either gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel, but not both.\n\nNow, if we want to infer 'The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel', we are essentially saying the same thing. This is because the second statement is equivalent to the first one. It is saying that if the blimp does not gribble a flonk, then it must gribble a wibble snorkel. But since the first statement already tells us that the blimp must gribble one of the two, the second statement does not add any new information.\n\nSo, the second statement is a logical consequence of the first one, and they mean the same thing.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
