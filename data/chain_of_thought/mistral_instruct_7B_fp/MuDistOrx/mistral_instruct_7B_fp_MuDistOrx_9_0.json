In other words, the snorkel must be flimsy by quank or it must be flimsy by fribble, but it cannot be flimsy by both quank and fribble at the same time.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer 'The snorkel must be flim by quank or it must be flim by fribble'. Since the original statement already implies this, the answer is 'yes', the original statement and the inferred statement are equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
