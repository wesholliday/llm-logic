            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence 'The flim must quazzle a frazzle or quazzle a glorp' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two alternatives that are mutually exclusive or exhaustive. In other words, either 'The flim must quazzle a frazzle' or 'The flim must quazzle a glorp' must happen, but not both. Therefore, the sentence 'The flim must quazzle a frazzle or it must quazzle a glorp' is logically equivalent to the original sentence and can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
