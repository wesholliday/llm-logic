It means that the floob must perform either the action of 'quorpling a zizz' or 'quorpling a zump'. However, the sentence does not specify that if the floob does not perform the first action, then it must perform the second action. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The floob must quorple a zizz or it must quorple a zump' from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
