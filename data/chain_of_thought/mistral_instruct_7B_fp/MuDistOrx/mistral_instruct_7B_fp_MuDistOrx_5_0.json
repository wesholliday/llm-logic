However, the statement 'The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble' is a conjunction, meaning it states that both 'The plonk must be on wibble' and 'The plonk must be on shimble' must be true. Therefore, this statement is not logically inferable from the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
