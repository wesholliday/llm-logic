            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, does the conclusion have to be true as well?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which means if the denial of the conclusion is assumed, then the denial of the premise must be true.\n\nLet's test this with a truth table:\n\n| Jeff played basketball | Amy must have played tennis | Jeff did not play basketball |\n|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| T                    | T                          | F                         |\n| T                    | F                          | F                         |\n| F                    | T                          | T                         |\n| F                    | F                          | T                         |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that if the conclusion is false (Jeff played basketball), then the second premise must be true (Amy does not have to play tennis). But the first premise is a conditional statement, which means if the first part is false (Jeff did not play basketball), then the conclusion must be true (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nHowever, the second premise contradicts the first premise, which means the argument is not logically valid because it contains a contradiction.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
