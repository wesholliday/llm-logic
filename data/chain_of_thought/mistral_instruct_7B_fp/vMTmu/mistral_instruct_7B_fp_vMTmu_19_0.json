            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and its negation. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe logical form of this argument is known as \"Modus Tollens\" in classical logic. According to this rule, if we have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q and its negation \u00acQ, then we can infer the negation of P, \u00acP.\n\nSo, to check the validity of this argument, we need to see if the conclusion \u00acP (Tom did not watch football) follows logically from the premises P \u2192 Q (If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball) and \u00acQ (It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid. According to the rule of Modus Tollens, if the conditional statement P \u2192 Q and its negation \u00acQ are true, then the negation of P, \u00acP, is also true. In this case, P is 'Tom watched football', Q is 'Jen must have watched basketball', and \u00acQ is 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball'. Since \u00acQ is true, according to Modus Tollens, \u00acP (Tom did not watch football) is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid."
