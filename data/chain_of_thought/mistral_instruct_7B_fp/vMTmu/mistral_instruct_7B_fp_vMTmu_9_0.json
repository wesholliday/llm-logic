            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, we need to see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false, i.e., Lisa bought the red shirt. If this is true, then according to Premise 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, Premise 2 states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction between Premise 1 and Premise 2, given that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nSince a contradiction has been found, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
