Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case, P is 'The griffin was in the forest', and Q is 'The unicorn must have been in the forest'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. (This is the first premise.)\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. (This is the second premise.)\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. This is because the first premise tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must be there as well. But the second premise tells us that the unicorn is not necessarily in the forest. Therefore, the griffin cannot be in the forest either, because if it were, the unicorn would have to be there as well, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
