            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it necessarily true that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (P1)\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (P2)\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red (C)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (P1) and its contradiction (P2). If P1 is true, then it implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, P2 states that it's not the case that the banana must be yellow. This means that either the banana is not yellow, or it's not necessarily the case that the banana must be yellow.\n\nSince P1 states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, and P2 contradicts this, it means that the apple cannot be red. Therefore, the conclusion 'The apple was not red' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
