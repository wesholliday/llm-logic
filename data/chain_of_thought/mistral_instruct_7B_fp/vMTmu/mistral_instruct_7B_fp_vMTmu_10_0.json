In this case, P is 'The dog was inside' and Q is 'The cat must have been outside'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the first premise is true and the second premise is false, does that mean the dog could not have been inside?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (first premise).\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside (second premise).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that the dog could not have been inside. This is because if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (first premise). But we know that it's not the case that the cat must have been outside (second premise). Therefore, the dog could not have been inside.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
