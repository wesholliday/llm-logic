The second premise is 'not Q'.\n\nIn a conditional argument, the validity depends on whether the premises are true and whether the argument follows the rules of logical inference. In this case, the argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of inference. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the premises are indeed true. The first premise is a conditional statement, and its truth depends on the truth of both the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q). In this case, the antecedent is 'Alex finished the race', and the consequent is 'Chris must have finished the race'.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race'. This is equivalent to saying that it is possible for Chris not to have finished the race.\n\nIf Chris did not finish the race, then the first premise is false, and the argument is not valid. However, if Chris did finish the race, then the first premise is true, but the second premise is false, and the argument is not valid either.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, because its premises can be true and the conclusion false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
