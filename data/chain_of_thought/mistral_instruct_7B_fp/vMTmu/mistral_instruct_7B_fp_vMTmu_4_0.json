In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter (P1)\n2. It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter (P2)\n3. Therefore, the alien did not visit Mars (C)\n\nThe argument is a conditional argument, where the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nNow, let's test the argument for validity:\n1. If we assume that the alien visited Mars (make P1 true), then according to P1, the robot must have visited Jupiter. But P2 tells us that it's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both the robot visiting Jupiter and it not being the case that the robot must visit Jupiter.\n2. However, if we assume that the alien did not visit Mars (make P1 false), then P2 is still true, and the conclusion is also true.\n\nSince the argument leads to a contradiction when we assume that the premises are true, it is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
