In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (P1)\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (P2)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake (C)\n\nThe argument uses conditional logic, where P1 is a conditional statement (if-then statement). If we denote the statement 'V' for 'the vampire was awake' and 'M' for 'the mummy was awake', then the argument can be represented as:\n\n1. If V, then M\n2. Not M\n3. Therefore, not V\n\nTo check if this argument is logically valid, we can use the method of contradiction. If we assume the conclusion is false (V is true), and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction with the premises, then the argument is invalid. However, if we can't find a contradiction, then the argument is valid.\n\nLet's assume V is true (the vampire was awake). According to P1, if V is true, then M must be true as well. But P2 states that it's not the case that M must be true. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have both V and not M at the same time. Therefore, our assumption that V is false leads to a contradiction, which means that V must be false (the vampire was not awake).\n\nSince we couldn't find a contradiction when assuming the conclusion is false, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
