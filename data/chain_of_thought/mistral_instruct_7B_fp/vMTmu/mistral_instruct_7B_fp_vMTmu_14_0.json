In other words, if we accept the premises as true, does the conclusion have to be true as well?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the bear was not in the cave (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument uses a conditional statement in Premise 1, which means that if the first part (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the second part (the wolf being in the den) must be true as well. Premise 2 contradicts this conditional statement by stating that it's not the case that the wolf must be in the den.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If Premise 2 is true, then the conditional statement in Premise 1 cannot be true. This means that the bear being in the cave cannot logically imply that the wolf must be in the den. Therefore, if the wolf cannot be in the den, it does not necessarily mean that the bear cannot be in the cave. However, the argument does not provide any information about the bear being in the cave, so it's not necessarily false either.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
