            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false, i.e., Ben did eat pasta. If this is the case, then according to Premise 1, Kate must have eaten salad. But Premise 2 states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'Kate must have eaten salad' and 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad' be true at the same time.\n\nSince denying the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
