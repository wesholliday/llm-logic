            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, we need to see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the doll was not plastic. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false, i.e., the doll was plastic. If this is the case, then according to Premise 1, the truck must have been metal. However, Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This creates a contradiction between Premise 1 and Premise 2, given that the doll is assumed to be plastic.\n\nSince a contradiction has been found, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
