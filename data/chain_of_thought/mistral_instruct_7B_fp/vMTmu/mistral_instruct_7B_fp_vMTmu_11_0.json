            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive reasoning that goes as follows: If P then Q, not Q, therefore not P.\n\nIn this case, P is 'The cake was chocolate', and Q is 'The muffins must have been blueberry'.\n\nThe first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. The second premise states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nIf it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, then it cannot be the case that the cake was chocolate and the muffins must have been blueberry (because the first premise states that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry). Therefore, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
