The conclusion is then drawn from the negation of the second premise, 'It's not the case that Q'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, does that mean the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Premise 1: 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train'\n2. Premise 2: 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train'\n3. Conclusion: 'Sam did not take a plane'\n\nThe conclusion 'Sam did not take a plane' does not necessarily follow from the premises. The argument assumes that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must take a train, and then concludes that if Erin does not have to take a train, then Sam cannot take a plane. However, this is not a valid inference.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the first premise is true, but the second premise is false due to a mistake. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must take a train. But in fact, Erin does have to take a train. In this case, Sam can still take a plane, and the conclusion 'Sam did not take a plane' would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
