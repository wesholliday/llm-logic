            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive reasoning that goes as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding', which can be represented as 'P' implies 'Q'. The second premise is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding', which can be represented as 'not Q'. The conclusion is 'Mary was not at the wedding', which can be represented as 'not P'.\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, it must be such that if its premises are true, then its conclusion must also be true. In other words, if the argument is sound (i.e., its premises are true), then its conclusion must be true.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the structure of modus tollens and if its premises are true or could be true given some assumptions.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, and if the second premise is true (i.e., 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding'), then the first premise cannot be true (i.e., 'Mary was at the wedding' cannot be true, given that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding'). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
