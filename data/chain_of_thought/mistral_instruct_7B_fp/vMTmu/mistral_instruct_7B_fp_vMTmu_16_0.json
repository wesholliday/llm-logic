In other words, if the premises are true, is it necessarily true that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which means 'if P then Q, not Q, therefore not P'.\n\nExamining the premises, we can see that Premise 1 is a conditional statement, and Premise 2 is a negation of the consequent (Q) in that conditional statement. If we assume that Premise 1 is true, and Premise 2 is also true, then it follows logically that the shirt was not cotton (P).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
