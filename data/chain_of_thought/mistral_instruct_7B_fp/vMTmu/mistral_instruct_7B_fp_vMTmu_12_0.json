            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive reasoning that goes as follows: If P then Q, not Q, therefore not P. In this case, P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy must have gone to the zoo'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, if the argument is logically valid, then if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (P implies Q)\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (not Q)\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (not P).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo, then it follows that Joe did not go to the park."
