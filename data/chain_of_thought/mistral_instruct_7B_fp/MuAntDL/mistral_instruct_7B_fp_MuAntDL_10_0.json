            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The document must have been signed or notarized' means that the document must meet either one or both of these conditions. 'Signed' and 'notarized' are two different requirements for a document. 'Signed' means that the document has been marked with a signature, typically of the person who created or agreed to the contents of the document. 'Notarized' means that the document has been witnessed and authenticated by a notary public, who is a public officer authorized to administer oaths and attest to the signing of documents.\n\nWhile both 'signed' and 'notarized' are ways of authenticating a document, they are not the same thing. Therefore, just because a document must be 'signed or notarized' does not mean that it must be 'signed'. It could be that the document only needs to be 'notarized', or it could be that it needs to be both 'signed' and 'notarized'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The document must have been signed' from 'The document must have been signed or notarized'."
