            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours' is a disjunction, meaning it consists of two mutually exclusive options. If one option is true, the other must be false. However, the statement does not provide enough information to definitively say that the restaurant was closed on Monday. It only suggests that one of the two possibilities is true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
