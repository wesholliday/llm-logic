This statement does not necessarily mean that the meeting took place at 2 PM, but it does leave that possibility open. However, to infer that 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM', we would need more information or a stronger statement that explicitly states that the meeting took place at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM' based on the given statement."
