In this case, the keys could have been in the drawer, or they could have been on the table. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the keys were in the drawer. It only means that they were either in the drawer or on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The keys must have been in the drawer' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
