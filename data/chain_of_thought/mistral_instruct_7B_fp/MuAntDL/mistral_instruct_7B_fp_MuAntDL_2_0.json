However, it does not necessarily mean that the book was in both places. If we want to infer that the book was specifically on the shelf, we would need more information or a stronger statement that explicitly mentions the book being on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book must have been on the shelf' based on the given statement."
