However, the second premise states that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nSince the griffin's presence in the forest is dependent on the unicorn's presence (according to the first premise), and we know that the unicorn is not in the forest, it follows that the griffin cannot be in the forest either.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
