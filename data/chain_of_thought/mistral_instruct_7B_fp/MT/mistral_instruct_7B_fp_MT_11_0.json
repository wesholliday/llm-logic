It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The second statement 'The muffins were not blueberry' tells us that the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between the cake and the muffins. If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. But we know that the muffins are not blueberry. This means that the condition in the first statement (the cake being chocolate) cannot be true, because if it were, then the muffins would have to be blueberry, and we know that they are not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
