This statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the dog being inside) is true, then the second part (the cat being outside) must also be true. However, if the first part is false, then the second part can be true or false, as the statement does not provide any information about the second part when the first part is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the second piece of information: 'The cat was not outside'. This statement tells us that the cat was not in one of the two possible locations: outside or inside. But it does not tell us anything about the dog's location.\n\nSince the 'If-then' statement does not provide any information about the cat's location when the dog is inside, and the second statement does not provide any information about the dog's location, we cannot infer anything definitive about the dog's location based on these two pieces of information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' based on 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' and 'The cat was not outside'."
