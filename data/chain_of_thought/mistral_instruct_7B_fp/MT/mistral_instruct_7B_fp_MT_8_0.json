            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given premises are 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' and 'The mummy was not awake'.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. However, the second premise states that the consequence (the mummy being awake) is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the condition (the vampire being awake) is true. If it is, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. But we know that the consequence is false, which means that our assumption that the condition is true leads to a contradiction.\n\nIn logic, when a contradiction arises, it means that at least one of the premises must be false. Since we cannot assume that the first premise is false (as it is a conditional statement and its truth depends on the truth of its condition), we must assume that the condition is false. In other words, the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
