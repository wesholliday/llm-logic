This statement means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. It does not mean that if the truck is not blue, then the car cannot be red.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement 'The truck was not blue'. This statement tells us that the truck is not blue, but it does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, we cannot infer that the car is not red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The car was not red'."
