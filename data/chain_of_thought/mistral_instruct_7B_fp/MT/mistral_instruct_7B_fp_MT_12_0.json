However, the second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which contradicts the consequence of the first premise.\n\nSince the consequence of the first premise is not true (Lucy did not go to the zoo), it is not necessarily true that the condition of the first premise (Joe went to the park) is also true. However, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park either, because the first premise does not guarantee that Joe went to the park if Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about whether Joe went to the park or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park'."
