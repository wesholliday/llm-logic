            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This means that if Mary is at the wedding, then it follows that Sue is also at the wedding. The second statement given is 'Sue was not at the wedding'. This means that Sue is not present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. The first statement tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding. However, the second statement tells us that Sue is not at the wedding. This creates a contradiction, as it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time.\n\nSince we cannot have a contradiction, it means that at least one of the statements must be false. Since we know that the first statement cannot be false (because it is a conditional statement and the 'if' part is true or false as a whole), then the only possible false statement is the second one, which is 'Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be inferred that 'Mary was not at the wedding', but rather that 'Sue was not at the wedding' is false, which means that Sue was actually at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'. Instead, we can infer that 'Sue was at the wedding' (because the opposite of 'Sue was not at the wedding' is true)."
