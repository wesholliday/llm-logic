            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Jeff playing basketball) occurs, then another event (Amy playing tennis) also occurs.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Amy did not play tennis'. This means that Amy did not fulfill the condition in the first statement, which was playing tennis if Jeff played basketball.\n\nHowever, the absence of Amy playing tennis does not necessarily mean that Jeff did not play basketball. The conditional statement only tells us that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis. It does not say that if Amy does not play tennis, then Jeff does not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
