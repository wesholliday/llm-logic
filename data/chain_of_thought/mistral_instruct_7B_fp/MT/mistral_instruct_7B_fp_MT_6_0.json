The second statement 'Bob did not choose pasta' is a fact that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of these two statements. If Bob did not choose pasta, then according to the first statement, Sue cannot have chosen pizza either, because if she had, Bob would have had to choose pasta.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it seems that we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
