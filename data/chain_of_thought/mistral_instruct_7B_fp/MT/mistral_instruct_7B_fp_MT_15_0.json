The second statement 'Erin did not take a train' is a negation of the second part of the first statement.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily mean that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. The first statement only tells us that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. It does not tell us anything about the situation where Erin does not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Sam did not take a plane' based on 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Erin did not take a train'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
