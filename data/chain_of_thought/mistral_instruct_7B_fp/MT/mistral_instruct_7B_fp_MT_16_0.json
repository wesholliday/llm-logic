The second premise states that the pants are not denim.\n\nSince the pants are not denim, it means that the condition in the first premise is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt is not cotton. The conditional statement only tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. It does not say that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
