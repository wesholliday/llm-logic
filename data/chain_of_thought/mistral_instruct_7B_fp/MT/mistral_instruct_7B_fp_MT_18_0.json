The first premise tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. The second premise tells us that the truck is not metal.\n\nSince the truck is not metal, according to the first premise, the doll should not be plastic. However, the given information does not definitively state that the doll is not plastic; it only implies that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would have to be metal, but we know that the truck is not metal.\n\nTherefore, while it is a logical possibility that the doll is not plastic, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on the given premises."
