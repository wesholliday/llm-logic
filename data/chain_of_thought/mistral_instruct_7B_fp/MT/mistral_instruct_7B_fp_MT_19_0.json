            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This means that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. The second statement is 'Jen did not watch basketball'. This means that Jen did not watch basketball, regardless of whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nHowever, the absence of Jen watching basketball does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football. The 'if' statement only tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. It does not say that if Jen does not watch basketball, then Tom does not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
