It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. The second statement 'Chris did not finish the race' is a fact.\n\nNow, let's analyze these two statements together. The first statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished as well. However, the second statement tells us that Chris did not finish the race. This means that the condition in the first statement (Alex finishing the race) did not occur.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'Alex did not finish the race'. Instead, we can infer that the condition 'Alex finished the race' is false, which means that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot directly infer 'Alex did not finish the race'. However, we can infer that 'Alex did not finish the race' is a possible conclusion based on the given information."
