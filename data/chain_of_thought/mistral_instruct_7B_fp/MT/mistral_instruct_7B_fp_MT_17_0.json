This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate the salad) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Kate did not eat the salad'. This statement contradicts the second part of the conditional statement, meaning that Ben cannot have eaten pasta, because if he did, then Kate would have had to eat the salad, but she didn't.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
