            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. The second statement 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is a negation of the second part of the first statement.\n\nNow, let's think about what these statements mean together. The first statement tells us that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. The second statement tells us that Mark does not buy the blue shirt.\n\nIf Mark does not buy the blue shirt, then the condition in the first statement cannot be true. This means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt either, because the first statement is a conditional statement, and if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) cannot be true either.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
