However, this does not necessarily mean that the dreb was definitely not vroombed. It only means that it's one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed', as the statement 'must have been vroombed' implies certainty, which is not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
