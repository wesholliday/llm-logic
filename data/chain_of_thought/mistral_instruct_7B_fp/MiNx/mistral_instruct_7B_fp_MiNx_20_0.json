However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a fact that the fleeg was not bluttered. It only means that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered', as it is not a logical conclusion that the fleeg must have been bluttered if it might not have been.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
