This is not the same as saying that it is a fact that the flob was not skizzled, but rather that it is not necessarily the case that the flob was skizzled. Therefore, it is logically consistent with this statement to infer 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
