However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a fact that the smip was not shripped. It only means that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped' directly from 'The smip might not have been shripped'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
