However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a fact that the twonk was not plinked. It only means that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked' directly from 'The twonk might not have been plinked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
