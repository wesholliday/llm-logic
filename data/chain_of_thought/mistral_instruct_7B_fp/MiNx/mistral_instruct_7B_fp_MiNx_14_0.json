However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the clug was definitely not fleeked. It only suggests that it could be the case. Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked', as the statement does not rule out the possibility that the clug was indeed fleeked.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked' based on the given statement. The statement only suggests that the clug might not have been fleeked, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility that it was."
