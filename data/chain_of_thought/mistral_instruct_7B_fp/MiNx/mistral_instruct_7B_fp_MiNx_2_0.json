This is not the same as saying 'It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped', which is a stronger statement that asserts the negation of the necessity of the wug being flooped. However, since 'The wug might not have been flooped' already implies that the wug's being flooped is not a necessity, it does not contradict the stronger statement. Therefore, while the two statements are not identical, they are not in contradiction either.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
