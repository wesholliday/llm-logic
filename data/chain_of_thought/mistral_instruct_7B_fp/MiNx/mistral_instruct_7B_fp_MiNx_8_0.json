It suggests that there is a chance or possibility that the sprocket was not cranked. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was definitely not cranked. It only implies that it could be the case that the sprocket was not cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked' based on this statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
