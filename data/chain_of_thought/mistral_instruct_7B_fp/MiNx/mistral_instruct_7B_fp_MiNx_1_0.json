However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a certainty that the flugel was not blimmed. It only means that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed', as it is not a logical conclusion that the flugel must have been blimmed if it might not have been.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
