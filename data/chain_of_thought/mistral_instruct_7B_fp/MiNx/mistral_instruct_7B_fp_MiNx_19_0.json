However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a fact that the smonk was not vreebled. It only means that it is one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled', but we cannot infer 'It's a fact that the smonk was not vreebled' based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled'."
