The second statement 'The clug is not snugged' tells us that the clug is not in the first state (snugged). However, this does not necessarily mean that the clug is in the second state (fleeked). The statement 'The clug is not snugged' only tells us that the clug is not snugged, not that it is fleeked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The clug is fleeked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
