However, the second statement 'The splat is not quanked' tells us that the splat is not in the quanked state. This does not necessarily mean that the splat is in the morphed state, as the statement 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed' does not exclude the possibility of the splat being in neither state. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
