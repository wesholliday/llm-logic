However, it does not specify that the smonk has both conditions or only one of them.\n\nThe second statement 'The smonk is not plagged' means that the smonk does not have the condition 'plagged'. But it does not necessarily mean that the smonk does not have the condition 'vreebled'.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, we cannot infer that 'The smonk is vreebled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
