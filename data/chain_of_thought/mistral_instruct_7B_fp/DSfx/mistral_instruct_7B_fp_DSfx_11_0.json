However, the second statement tells us that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nSince we know that the flug is not zimmed, and the disjunction 'Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed' means that at least one of the conditions must be true, it follows that the other condition must be true. Therefore, the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
