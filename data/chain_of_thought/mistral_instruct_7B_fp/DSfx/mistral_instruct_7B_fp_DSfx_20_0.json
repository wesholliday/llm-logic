The second statement 'The fleeg is not surned' negates the first condition, making it impossible for the fleeg to be surned. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered, as the first statement also allows for the possibility that the fleeg is bluttered. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
