However, it does not specify that the fribble must be in one state or the other. It only states that one of the two states must be true.\n\nThe second statement 'The fribble is not crinked' means that the fribble is not in the crinked state. But it does not necessarily mean that the fribble is in the snurgled state either. It only means that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'. The fribble could still be in the crinked state, and we do not have enough information to say otherwise.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
