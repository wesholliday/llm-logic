The statement 'The sprocket is not daggled' means that the sprocket is not in the daggled state. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the sprocket is in the cranked state. It only means that the sprocket is not daggled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket is cranked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
