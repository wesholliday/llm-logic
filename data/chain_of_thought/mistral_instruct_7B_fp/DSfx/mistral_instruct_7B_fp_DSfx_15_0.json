The second statement 'The dreb is not spened' tells us that the first event (spending the dreb) did not occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the second event (vroombing the dreb) did occur. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
