However, the second statement negates the first one, meaning the flugel cannot be zargled.\n\nSince the flugel is not zargled, and the disjunction 'Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed' means that at least one of the conditions must be true, then the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
