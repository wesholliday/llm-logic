The second statement 'The whiffle is not tinked' means that the whiffle was not hit well, but it does not necessarily mean that it was shanked. It could have been hit poorly in some other way. Therefore, based on these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
