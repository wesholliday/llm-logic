The statement 'The shank is not nugged' means that the shank is not in the nugged state. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the shank is in the plooked state. It only means that the shank is not nugged. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shank is plooked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
