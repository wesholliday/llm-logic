The second statement 'The grommet is not plopped' tells us that the grommet is not in the plopped state. However, this does not necessarily mean that the grommet is in the sploffed state. It only means that the grommet is not in the plopped state. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet is sploffed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
