The statement 'The zinger is not smoogled' means that the zinger is not in the smoogled state. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the zinger is in the fraggled state. It only means that the zinger is not smoogled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The zinger is fraggled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
