The second statement 'The missing sock isn't under the bed' tells us that the sock is not in the location under the bed. Since we know that the sock cannot be in both places at once, and it's not under the bed, the only remaining possibility is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
