The statement 'The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet' means that the umbrella is not in its tucked-away location in the closet.\n\nSince we know that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, it follows that the umbrella must be in the car, because the only other option mentioned in the first statement is not the case.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
