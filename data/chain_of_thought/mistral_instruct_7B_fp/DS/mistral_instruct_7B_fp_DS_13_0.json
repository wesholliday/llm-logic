            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf' means that the toy can be in one of two places: either in the toy box or on the shelf. The second statement 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf' tells us that the toy is not in the second location mentioned in the first statement. However, it does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the first location (the toy box). Therefore, we cannot infer 'The toy is in the toy box' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
