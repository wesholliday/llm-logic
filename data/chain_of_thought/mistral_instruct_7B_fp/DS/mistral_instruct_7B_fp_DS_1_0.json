            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' means that Fido is either in one of two places: inside the house or in the garden. The second statement 'Fido is not in the garden' tells us that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside the house. It only means that Fido is not in the garden, which leaves the possibility that Fido is still outside, but just not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
