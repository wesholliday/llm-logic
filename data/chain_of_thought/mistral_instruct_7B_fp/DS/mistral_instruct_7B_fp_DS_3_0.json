            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet' means that the keys can be found in one of two places: the drawer or the cabinet, dangling. The second statement 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet' tells us that the keys are not in the cabinet, dangling. However, it does not necessarily mean that the keys are in the drawer. The keys could be somewhere else, like lost or in someone's pocket. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The keys are in the drawer' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
