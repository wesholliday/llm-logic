            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand' means that the notebook can be found in one of two places: either in the drawer or on the nightstand. However, the statement 'The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand' tells us that the notebook is not in its second possible location, which is the nightstand. Since we know that the notebook is not on the nightstand, and we also know that it must be in one of the two possible locations, it follows logically that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
