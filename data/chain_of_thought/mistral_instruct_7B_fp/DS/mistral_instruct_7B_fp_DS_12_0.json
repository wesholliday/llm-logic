The second statement 'The jacket isn't hanging in the closet' tells us that the jacket is not in the closet. Since we know that the jacket is not in the closet, and the only other option given is that it's draped over the chair, we can infer that 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
