The second statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' tells us that the book is not in the second place mentioned in the first statement. However, it does not necessarily mean that the book is in the first place mentioned in the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book is on the shelf' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
