            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head' means that the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head, but not both at the same time. The second statement 'The sunglasses aren't perched on her head' tells us that the sunglasses are not on her head. Since we know that the sunglasses cannot be both in the bag and on her head, and we also know that they are not on her head, it follows logically that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
