            "content": "Explanation: Notarization is a process that involves a notary public witnessing the signing of a document to verify the identity of the signer and ensure that the signer is signing the document willingly and under no duress. Therefore, if a document is notarized, it means that it has been signed and notarized. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. A document can be signed without being notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be notarized' alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
