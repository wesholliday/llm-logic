However, it does not necessarily imply that the exam will be difficult. The difficulty level of an exam can depend on various factors such as the depth of the questions, the time allotted, and the student's understanding of the topics. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The exam might be difficult and cover all chapters' based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
