However, it does not necessarily mean that the wump can do both actions at the same time or in succession. To infer 'The wump might blimp zump and the wump might blimp wibble', we would need additional information or context suggesting that the wump can perform these actions sequentially or simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: No, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The wump might blimp zump and the wump might blimp wibble'."
