It could be 'quorple' or it could be 'snork'. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'The wobble might be quorple and the wobble might be snork' is also a possibility. The original sentence only suggests that 'The wobble' could have one of the two properties, not both at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No."
