However, this statement does not exclude the possibility that the quimble could be both a quazzle and a quibble at the same time. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say 'no' to the statement 'The quimble might be quazzle and the quimble might be quibble'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
