The second statement \"The cat was not outside\" contradicts the first condition that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that the dog is inside. The statement only tells us that the cat is not outside, but it does not provide any information about the dog's location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside."
