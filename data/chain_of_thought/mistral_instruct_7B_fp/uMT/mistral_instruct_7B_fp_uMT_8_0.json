However, the second statement \"the mummy was not awake\" contradicts the first one. This contradiction means that the conditions stated in the first statement cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, at least one of the conditions must be false. Since we cannot infer that the mummy was awake given the second statement, we must infer that the condition in the first statement that leads to the mummy being awake is false. In other words, the vampire must not be awake.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
