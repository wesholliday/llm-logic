This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both Sue choosing pizza and Bob not choosing pasta, according to the first statement. However, the second statement does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza either. Since we have insufficient information to determine whether Sue chose pizza or not, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza."
