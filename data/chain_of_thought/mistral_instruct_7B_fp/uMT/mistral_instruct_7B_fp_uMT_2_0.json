However, the second statement \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" contradicts the first statement, as it states that the unicorn is not in the forest, which should not be the case if the griffin is in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"Can we infer that the griffin was not in the forest?\"\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given information. The contradiction in the statements does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the griffin's location."
