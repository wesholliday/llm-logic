            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement given is that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" However, we are also told that \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This creates a contradiction, as the first statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but the second statement tells us that Jen did not watch basketball. This contradiction means that the initial assumption that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is not always true.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Tom's watching habits based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football."
