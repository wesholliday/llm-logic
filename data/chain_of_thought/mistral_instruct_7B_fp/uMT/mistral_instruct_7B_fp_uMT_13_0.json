The second statement \"The truck was not blue\" means that the truck is not blue under any condition.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the car is red. If the car is red, then according to the first statement, the truck must be blue. But we know from the second statement that the truck is not blue. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both the car being red and the truck being blue, and the truck not being blue at the same time.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the car is not red based on this information alone. The reason is that the second statement \"The truck was not blue\" does not necessarily mean that the car cannot be red. It only means that the truck is not blue under any condition.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on the given information."
