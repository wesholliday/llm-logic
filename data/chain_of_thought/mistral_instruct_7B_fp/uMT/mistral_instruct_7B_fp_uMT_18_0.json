However, we are also given that \"the truck was not metal.\" This contradicts the first part of the conditional statement, as the truck cannot be both metal and not metal at the same time.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion that \"we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\" This would mean that since the conditional statement is false (due to the truck not being metal), then the doll must not be plastic. However, this is not necessarily true. The fact that the conditional statement is false does not automatically mean that the first part of the statement (doll being plastic) is also false. It only means that the second part (truck being metal) is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
