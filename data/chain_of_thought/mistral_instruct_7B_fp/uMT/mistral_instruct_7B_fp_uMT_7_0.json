This means that both conditions cannot be true at the same time. However, we cannot directly infer that Alex did not finish the race based on this contradiction, as the information provided does not definitively prove that Alex did finish the race either.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the given information."
