The second statement \"The wolf was not in the den\" contradicts the first implication. This creates a contradiction, as we have two conflicting pieces of information.\n\nHowever, the contradiction does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave. It only means that the information given to us is inconsistent. We cannot infer anything definitive about the bear's location based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave."
