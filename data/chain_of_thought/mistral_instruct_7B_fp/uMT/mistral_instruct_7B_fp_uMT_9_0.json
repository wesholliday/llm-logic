However, it also states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that both conditions cannot be true at the same time, as they contradict each other. Therefore, we cannot infer anything definitive about Lisa's purchase of the red shirt based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The given information is inconsistent and does not allow for a clear conclusion."
