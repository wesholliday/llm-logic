However, the second statement \"Erin did not take a train\" contradicts the first statement. This creates a logical inconsistency, meaning that neither statement can be considered true based on the given information.\n\nSince we cannot determine whether Sam took a plane or not based on the given information, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane either.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane."
