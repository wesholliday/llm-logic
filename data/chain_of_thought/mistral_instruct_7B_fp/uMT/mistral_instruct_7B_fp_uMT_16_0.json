This creates a contradiction, as the statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim, but we know that the pants are not denim.\n\nSince the given information leads to a contradiction, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions about the material of the shirt based on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton."
