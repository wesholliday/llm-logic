The second statement 'The whiffle tinked' tells us that the whiffle did make the specific sound. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the whiffle was shanked. It only means that the whiffle made the sound, which could have happened for various reasons. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle was shanked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
