The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the consequence (the smonk plagged) is also true. The second statement is a simple statement that asserts that the smonk plagged.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first condition (the smonk was vreebled) is true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk was vreebled' based on 'The smonk plagged' alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
