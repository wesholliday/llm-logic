            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' means that whenever the fribble is snurgled, it will crinkle as a result. The second statement 'The fribble crinked' tells us that the fribble has crinkled, but it does not necessarily mean that the fribble was snurgled. The crinkling could have been caused by some other reason. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was snurgled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
