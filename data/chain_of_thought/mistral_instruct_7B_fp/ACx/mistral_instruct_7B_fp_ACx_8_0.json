            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must also be daggled. The second statement 'The sprocket was daggled' tells us that the sprocket is in the daggled state. However, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was cranked to reach the daggled state. It could be that the sprocket was daggled for some other reason. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was cranked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
