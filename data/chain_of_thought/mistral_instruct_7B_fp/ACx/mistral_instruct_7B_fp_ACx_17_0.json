The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the consequence (the flob movated) is also true. The second premise states that the consequence is true (the flob movated). However, the premises do not provide enough information to infer that the condition is also true (the flob was skizzled). Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was skizzled' based on these premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
