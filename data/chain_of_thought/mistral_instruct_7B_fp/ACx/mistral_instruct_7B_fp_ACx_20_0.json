The first sentence is a conditional statement, meaning that if the fleeg was bluttered (a certain event), then it surned (another event). The second sentence states that the fleeg surned, but it does not provide any information about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nSince the second sentence does not provide enough information to conclude that the fleeg was bluttered, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was bluttered' based on these two sentences.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
