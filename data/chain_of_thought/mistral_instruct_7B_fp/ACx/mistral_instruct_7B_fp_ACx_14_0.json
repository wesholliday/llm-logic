The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequence (the clug snugged) is also true. The second premise states that the consequence (the clug snugged) is indeed true. However, the truth of the condition (the clug was fleeked) is not explicitly stated in the premises. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug was fleeked based on these two premises alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
