The statement 'The fribble might not be crinked' means that it is possible for the fribble to be in a state other than crinked, but it does not specify what that state is. Since we cannot infer from 'The fribble might not be crinked' that the fribble is in the 'snurgled' state, we cannot infer 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
