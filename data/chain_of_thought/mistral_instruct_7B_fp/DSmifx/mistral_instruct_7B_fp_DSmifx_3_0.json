The statement 'The splat might not be quanked' means that there is a possibility that the splat is not in the quanked state. However, this statement does not provide enough information to infer that the splat is definitely in the morphed state. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat is morphed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
