The statement 'The clug might not be snugged' means that there is a possibility that the clug is not in the first state (snugged). However, this statement does not provide any information about the second state (fleeked). Therefore, we cannot infer 'The clug is fleeked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
