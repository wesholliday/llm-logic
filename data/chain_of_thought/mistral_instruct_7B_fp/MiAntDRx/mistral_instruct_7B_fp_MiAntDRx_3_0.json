            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given sentence 'The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble' suggests that the fribble could be located either in the blurble or on the wumble. Since 'or' is a logical operator that means 'either...or', it implies that both possibilities are valid. Therefore, if the fribble could be on the wumble, then it is not necessarily true that it cannot be on the wumble, even if it might also be in the blurble. Therefore, based on the information given, it is possible to infer that 'The fribble might be on the wumble'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
