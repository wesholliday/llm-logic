In this statement, 'plonk' and 'zooble' are two possibilities for the film. The 'or' in this context means that either one or both of the possibilities can be true. Therefore, if we cannot rule out 'zooble' as a possibility, then it is still a valid option. Since we cannot determine from the given statement that 'plonk' is the only possibility, we cannot rule out 'zooble'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
