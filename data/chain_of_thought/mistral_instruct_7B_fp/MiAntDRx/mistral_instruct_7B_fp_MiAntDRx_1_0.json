However, it does not exclude the possibility that the frozz might be zibble alone. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say 'no', but we also cannot say 'yes' with certainty.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The frozz might be zibble' from 'The frozz might be quork a flonk or zibble' with absolute certainty. However, it is not a definitive 'no' either."
