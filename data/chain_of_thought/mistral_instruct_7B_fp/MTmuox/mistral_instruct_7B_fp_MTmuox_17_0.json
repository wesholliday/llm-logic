If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\n\nThe first statement means that there is no necessity for the flob to move. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between being skizzled and moving for the flob.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference 'The flob was not skizzled'. To make this inference, we would need to know that the flob's not moving is sufficient to prove that it was not skizzled. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flob was not skizzled' based on the given statements."
