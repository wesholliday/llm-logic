This statement does not provide any information about the grommet being sploffed or not.\n\nThe second statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink' is a conditional statement. It means that if the grommet is sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. However, this statement does not mean that the grommet is necessarily sploffed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer 'The grommet was not sploffed'. The information given does not allow us to make such a conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' based on the given statements."
