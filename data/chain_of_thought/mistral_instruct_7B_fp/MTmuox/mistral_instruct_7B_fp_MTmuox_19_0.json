This means that it is not necessary for the smonk to have plagiarized, but it does not rule out the possibility that the smonk did plagiarize.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged'. This means that if the smonk was 'vreebled', then it is necessary for the smonk to have plagiarized. 'Vreebled' is not defined in the context, so we cannot assume what it means.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not vreebled'. The first statement does not rule out the possibility of the smonk being 'vreebled', and the second statement does not provide enough information to make such a conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
