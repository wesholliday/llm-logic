'It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint' means that the smip does not necessarily have to lupp the zoint.\n2. 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint' means that if the smip is shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can infer 'The smip was not shripped' from these statements.\n\nThe second statement 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint' suggests that if the smip is shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint. However, the first statement 'It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint' does not contradict this, as it only means that the smip does not necessarily have to lupp the zoint, not that it cannot.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The smip was not shripped' from these statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
