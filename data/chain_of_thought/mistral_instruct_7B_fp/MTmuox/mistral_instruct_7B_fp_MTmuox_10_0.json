The second statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled' means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be the case that it was garpled.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was not sproinged' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
