The second statement 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled' means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must also be zargled. However, this does not mean that the flugel was blimmed in the first place. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
