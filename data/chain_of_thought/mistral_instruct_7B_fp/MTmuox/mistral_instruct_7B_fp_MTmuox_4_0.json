The second statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked' means that if the fribble is snurgled, then it must crinkle.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides information about whether the fribble is snurgled or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
