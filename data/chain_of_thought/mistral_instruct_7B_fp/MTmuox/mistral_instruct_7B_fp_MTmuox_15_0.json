The second statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened' means that if the dreb was vroombed (whatever that means in this context), then it must have been spent.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about whether the dreb was vroombed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
