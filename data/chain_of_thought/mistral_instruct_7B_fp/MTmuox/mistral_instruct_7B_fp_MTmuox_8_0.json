The second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about whether the sprocket was actually cranked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
