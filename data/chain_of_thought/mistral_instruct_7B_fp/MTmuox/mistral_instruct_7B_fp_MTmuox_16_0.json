This means that it is not necessary for the sneg to sprot the frink.\n\nThe second statement given is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink'. This means that if the sneg is crampled, then it must sprot the frink.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from these two statements. The first statement does not rule out the possibility that the sneg is crampled and sprots the frink, and the second statement only tells us that if the sneg is crampled, it must sprot the frink, not that it is actually crampled. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive statement about the sneg's state of being crampled based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
