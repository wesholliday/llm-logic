This means that it is not necessarily true that the glip must have tragged, or in other words, the glip did not necessarily tragged.\n\nThe second statement given is 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged'. This means that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged'. The reason is that the second statement only tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged. It does not tell us that the glip was slogged, or that it was not slogged. Therefore, it is still possible that the glip was slogged and tragged, or that it was not slogged at all.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
