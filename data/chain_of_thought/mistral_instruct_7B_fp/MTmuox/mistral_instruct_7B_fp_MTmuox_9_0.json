In other words, the twonk can exist without being varnished.\n\nThe second statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished' is a conditional statement. It means that if the twonk is plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides information about whether the twonk is plinked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
