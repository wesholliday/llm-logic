The second statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged' means that if the clug is fleeked, then it must also be snugged. However, this does not mean that if the clug is not fleeked, then it cannot be snugged. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
