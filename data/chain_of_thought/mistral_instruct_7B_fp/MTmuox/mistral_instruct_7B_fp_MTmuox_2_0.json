This means that it is not necessarily true that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint'. This means that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nHowever, these two statements do not allow us to infer that 'The wug was not flooped'. The first statement does not rule out the possibility that the wug was flooped and bimmed the zoint, and the second statement only tells us that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint. It does not tell us that the wug was actually flooped.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wug was not flooped' based on the given information."
