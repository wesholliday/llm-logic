The first sentence states that the room was cleaned daily and had fresh towels. The second sentence, which you are asking if we can infer from the first, also states that the room was cleaned daily and had fresh towels. Since the two sentences mean the same thing, we can infer that the second sentence is a valid inference from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
