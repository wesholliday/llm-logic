            "content": "Explanation: The two statements given are 'The project must have been completed by Friday' and 'it must have been under budget'. The first statement is about the completion date of the project, and the second statement is about the budget constraint. Both conditions are independent of each other. Therefore, they can be combined into a single statement without changing their meaning. So, 'The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget' is a valid inference from the original statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
