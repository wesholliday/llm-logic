They both convey the same information that the meeting must take place at 2 PM and it must happen in the conference room. Therefore, the second statement 'it must be in the conference room' is already implicitly included in the first statement 'The meeting must be at 2 PM'. So, yes, we can infer 'The meeting must be at 2 PM and in the conference room' from 'The meeting must be at 2 PM and it must be in the conference room'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
