The first statement implies that the car is located within the garage, while the second statement implies that the car requires some form of maintenance or repair.\n\nTo infer a new statement from these two, we need to ensure that the new statement is logically consistent with the given statements. In this case, the new statement 'The car must be in the garage and need repairs' is a direct combination of the two given statements, and it is logically consistent with them. Therefore, the new statement can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
