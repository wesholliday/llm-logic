To deduce whether 'The doll was plastic' can be logically inferred, we need to check if the given premises form a valid argument and if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the given premises form a conditional statement, which means that if the first condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second condition (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, the given premises do not guarantee that the doll is actually plastic. Therefore, even though the truck is metal, we cannot logically deduce that the doll is also plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot logically deduce 'The doll was plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The truck was metal'."
