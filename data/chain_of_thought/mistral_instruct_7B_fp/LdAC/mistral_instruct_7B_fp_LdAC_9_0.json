            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nTo logically deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from these two statements, we would need to know that the first part of the first statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. However, the second statement only tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt, not whether Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
