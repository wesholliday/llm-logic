(Let's call this Premise 2)\n\nTo logically deduce 'The griffin was in the forest', we need to use the given premises to draw a conclusion that the griffin must also be in the forest.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, Premise 2 tells us that the unicorn is already in the forest. Since the presence of the unicorn in the forest satisfies the 'if' part of Premise 1, it follows that the griffin must also be in the forest to make the 'then' part of Premise 1 true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
