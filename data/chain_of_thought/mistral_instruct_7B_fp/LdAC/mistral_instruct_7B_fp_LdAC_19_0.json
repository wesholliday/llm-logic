            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first part of the conditional statement is true. It only means that Jen watched basketball, which is the consequence of the first part being true. The first part could still be false. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'Tom watched football' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
