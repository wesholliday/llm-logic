The pants were denim.\n\nFrom these two premises, we cannot logically deduce that the shirt was cotton. The first premise tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. However, it does not tell us anything about the shirt being cotton if the pants are denim. Therefore, while we know that the pants are denim, we cannot infer that the shirt is also cotton based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
