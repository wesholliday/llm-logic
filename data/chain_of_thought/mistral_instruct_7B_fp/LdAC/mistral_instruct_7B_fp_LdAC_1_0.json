This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about the logic of these two statements. If the second statement (Sue was at the wedding) is true, then according to the first statement (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding), it must also be true that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
