            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statements are 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' and 'The truck was blue'.\n\nTo deduce 'The car was red', we need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q' and 'P' is true, then 'Q' must be true. In this case, 'P' is 'The car was red' and 'Q' is 'The truck was blue'.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that 'The car was red' is true. The first statement only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. The second statement tells us that the truck is blue, but it does not necessarily mean that the car is red. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The car was red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
