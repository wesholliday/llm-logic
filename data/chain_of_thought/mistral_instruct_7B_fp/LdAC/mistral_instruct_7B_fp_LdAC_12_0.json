This means that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo. However, the second statement is just 'Lucy went to the zoo', which does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce 'Joe went to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
