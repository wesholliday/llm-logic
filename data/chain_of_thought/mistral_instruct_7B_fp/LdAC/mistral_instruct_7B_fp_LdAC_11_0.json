            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe first statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not necessarily mean that the cake is chocolate.\n\nThe second statement 'The muffins were blueberry' tells us that the muffins indeed are blueberry. But it does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, it does not necessarily mean that the cake is chocolate. The first statement could still be true, but we do not have enough information to conclude that the cake is chocolate.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot logically deduce 'The cake was chocolate' based on the given information."
