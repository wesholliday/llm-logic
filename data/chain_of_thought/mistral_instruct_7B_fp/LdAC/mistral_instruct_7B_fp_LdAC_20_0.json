            "content": "Explanation:\nTo logically deduce 'The apple was red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow', we need to apply the principle of modus ponens in logic. This principle states that if 'P' implies 'Q' and 'P' is true, then 'Q' must also be true.\n\nIn this case, 'P' is 'The apple was red' and 'Q' is 'The banana was yellow'. The first statement given is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This means that 'P' implies 'Q'. The second statement given is 'The banana was yellow'. This means that 'Q' is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that 'P' (the apple was red) is true based on these two statements alone. The reason is that the first statement only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. It does not tell us that the apple is necessarily red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce 'The apple was red'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
