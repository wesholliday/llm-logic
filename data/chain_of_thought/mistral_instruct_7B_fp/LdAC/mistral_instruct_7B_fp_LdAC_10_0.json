This is because the premise states that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. Since we know that the cat is outside, it follows that the dog cannot be inside at the same time.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that 'The dog was inside' is a logical conclusion. The given information only allows us to infer that 'The dog was not inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot logically deduce 'The dog was inside' from the given premises."
