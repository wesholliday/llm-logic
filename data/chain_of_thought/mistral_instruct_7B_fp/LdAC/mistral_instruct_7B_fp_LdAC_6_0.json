The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nGiven statement 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\nGiven statement 2: Bob chose pasta\n\nLet's apply the contrapositive to statement 1:\nIf not (Bob chose pasta), then not (Sue chose pizza)\n\nNow, let's see if statement 2 contradicts the contrapositive of statement 1:\n\nGiven statement 2: Bob chose pasta\nContrapositive of statement 1: If not (Bob chose pasta), then not (Sue chose pizza)\n\nSince statement 2 does not contradict the contrapositive of statement 1, we cannot logically deduce that Sue chose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
