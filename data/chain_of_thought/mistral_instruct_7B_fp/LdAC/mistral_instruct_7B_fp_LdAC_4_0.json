(Let's call this statement B)\n\nTo logically deduce 'The alien visited Mars' from these two premises, we need to use the rules of logical reasoning. In this case, we can use the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if A implies B and A is true, then B must be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we only have B as a given fact, and we cannot directly infer A from B. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The alien visited Mars' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot logically deduce 'The alien visited Mars' from 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' and 'The robot visited Jupiter'."
