The first piece of information tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. The second piece of information tells us that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nSo, if the doll is plastic, and we know that the doll is plastic, then according to the first piece of information, the truck must be metal.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
