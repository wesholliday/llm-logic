This means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also true. The second statement \"The apple was red\" tells us that the condition in the conditional statement is true. Therefore, based on the logic of the conditional statement, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
