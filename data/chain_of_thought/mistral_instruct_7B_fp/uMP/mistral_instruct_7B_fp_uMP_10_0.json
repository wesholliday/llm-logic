The second statement is \"The dog was inside.\" This means that the dog is currently inside the house.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information and see if we can infer that the cat is outside. Since we know that the dog is inside, we can check if this condition (the dog being inside) triggers the consequence mentioned in the first statement (the cat being outside). However, we do not have any information to suggest that the cat is outside. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat is outside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cat was outside."
