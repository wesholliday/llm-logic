This means that if Jeff plays basketball, then it is implied that Amy plays tennis. The second statement is 'Jeff played basketball.' This means that Jeff actually did play basketball.\n\nHowever, the first statement is an 'if-then' statement, which means it is a conditional statement. It does not necessarily mean that if the first condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second condition (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. It only implies that if the first condition is true, then the second condition is also likely to be true.\n\nTherefore, just because Jeff played basketball, we cannot definitively say that Amy played tennis. We can only say that it is likely that Amy played tennis, based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis based on the given information."
