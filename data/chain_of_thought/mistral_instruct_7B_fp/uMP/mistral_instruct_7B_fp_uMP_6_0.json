The second piece of information is that Sue indeed chose pizza.\n\nHowever, the information given does not allow us to infer that Bob chose pasta based on the fact that Sue chose pizza. This is because the first piece of information is a conditional statement, meaning it only applies if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true. But we cannot assume that the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) always follows, especially if we do not have any information about the situation outside of these two facts.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta based on the given information."
