The second statement is an independent statement: \"The cake was chocolate.\" This means that the cake is indeed chocolate.\n\nHowever, the given information does not allow us to infer that the muffins are blueberry based solely on the cake being chocolate. The first statement is a conditional statement, but it does not mean that the condition (cake being chocolate) is always true. It only means that if the condition is true, then the consequence (muffins being blueberry) is also true. But without knowing whether the muffins' color is actually dependent on the cake's, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the muffins were blueberry based on the given information."
