This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the vampire being awake) is true, then the second part (the mummy being awake) must also be true. The second statement is that 'the vampire was awake.' Since the vampire is indeed awake, according to the conditional statement, the mummy must also be awake.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
