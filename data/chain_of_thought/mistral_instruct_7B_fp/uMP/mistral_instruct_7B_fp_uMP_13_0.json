The second statement given is \"The car was red.\" This means that the car actually is red.\n\nNow, we can use the given information to make a conclusion about the truck. According to the first statement, if the car is red, then the truck is blue. Since we know that the car is red (from the second statement), we can infer that the truck must be blue as well, based on the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
