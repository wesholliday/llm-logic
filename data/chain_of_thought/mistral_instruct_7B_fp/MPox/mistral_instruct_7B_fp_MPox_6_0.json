The second statement is a conditional statement that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nIn order to infer 'The grommet plopped the frink', we need to determine if the condition in the second statement is true or false, given that the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.\n\nExplanation:\nSince the first statement is 'The grommet was sploffed', and the second statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink', we can infer that the grommet plopped the frink because the condition in the second statement is true, given that the first statement is true."
