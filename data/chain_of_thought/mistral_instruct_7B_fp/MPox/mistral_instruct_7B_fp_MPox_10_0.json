The second sentence 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. However, this does not mean that the wug was garpled, it only means that if the first condition (wug was sproinged) is true, then the second condition (it was garpled) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'It was garpled' based on the given information. The conditional statement only implies that if the first condition is true, then the second condition must also be true, but it does not mean that the second condition is necessarily true."
