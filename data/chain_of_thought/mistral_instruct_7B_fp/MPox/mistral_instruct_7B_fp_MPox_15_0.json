            "content": "Explanation: The first sentence 'The dreb was vroombed' does not provide enough information to determine if the second condition 'The dreb was spened' is true or false. However, the second sentence 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' suggests that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spent. Therefore, if we assume that the first sentence 'The dreb was vroombed' is true, then we can infer that 'The dreb was spened' is also true.\n\nAnswer: If 'The dreb was vroombed' is assumed to be true, then 'The dreb was spened' is also true."
