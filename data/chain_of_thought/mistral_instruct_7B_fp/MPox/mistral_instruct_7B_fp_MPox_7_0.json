The second statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' suggests that if the whiffle was hit poorly, then it made a certain sound, which we can infer to be 'tink'.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the whiffle made the 'tink' sound. It only implies that the whiffle was hit poorly. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle tinked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
