The second sentence 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' is a conditional statement, which means that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it surns. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fleeg has already surned. It only means that if it is bluttered, then it will surn. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg surned' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
