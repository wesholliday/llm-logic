The second statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' is a conditional statement, which means that if the flug was blummed, then it must also be zimmed. However, the first statement does not guarantee that the flug was zimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was zimmed' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
