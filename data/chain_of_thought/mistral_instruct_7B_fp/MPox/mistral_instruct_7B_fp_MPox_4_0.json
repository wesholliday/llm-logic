The second statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is a conditional statement that implies that if the fribble is in the state of being 'snurgled', then it will also be in the state of 'crinkling'.\n\nSince the first statement is a fact and the second statement is a conditional statement that assumes the first statement to be true, we can infer that if the fribble is in the state of being 'snurgled' (as stated in the first statement), then it will also be in the state of 'crinkling' (as stated in the second statement).\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
