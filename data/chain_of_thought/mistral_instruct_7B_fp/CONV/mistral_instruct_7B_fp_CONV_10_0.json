It means that if the dog is inside, then it follows that the cat is outside. However, this statement does not imply the reverse, that if the cat is outside, then the dog is inside. This is because the given statement only establishes a relationship between the dog and the cat in one direction, not both.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' from the given statement."
