This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. The converse is 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta'. This means that if the second part (Kate ate salad) is true, then the first part (Ben ate pasta) must also be true. But the given statement does not provide enough information to guarantee that Ben ate pasta every time Kate ate salad. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta' is always true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
