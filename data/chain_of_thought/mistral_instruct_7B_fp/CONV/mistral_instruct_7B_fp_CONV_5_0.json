This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. The converse is 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball'. This means that if the second part (Amy playing tennis) is true, then the first part (Jeff playing basketball) must also be true. But the given statement does not provide enough information to guarantee that Jeff plays basketball if Amy plays tennis. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
