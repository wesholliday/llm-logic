Here, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. This type of statement does not necessarily imply that if Q, then P is also true. In other words, just because the unicorn is in the forest, it does not mean that the griffin is also in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
