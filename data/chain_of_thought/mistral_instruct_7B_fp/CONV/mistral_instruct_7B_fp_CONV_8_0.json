            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is an example of a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy was awake'. This statement means that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q is also true.\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement, 'If Q, then P', is not necessarily true. This means that just because the mummy is awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire is awake. The reason for this is that the original statement does not imply a causal relationship between the two events. It only states that if one event occurs, then the other event also occurs.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake' based on the given statement."
