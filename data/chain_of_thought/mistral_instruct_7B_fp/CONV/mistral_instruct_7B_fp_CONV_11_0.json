It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, this does not mean that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate. This is because the statement only establishes a relationship between the cake and the muffins in one direction. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
