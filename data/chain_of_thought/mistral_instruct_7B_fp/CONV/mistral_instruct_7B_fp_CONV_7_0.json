This statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Alex finishing the race) occurs, then another event (Chris finishing the race) also occurs.\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because Chris finished the race, it does not mean that Alex finished the race as well. Chris could have finished the race before Alex, at the same time as Alex, or even after Alex. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
