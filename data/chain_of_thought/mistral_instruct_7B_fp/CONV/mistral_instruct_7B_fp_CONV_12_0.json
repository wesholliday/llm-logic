This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. The converse is 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park'. This means that if the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, then the first part (Joe went to the park) must also be true. But the given statement does not provide enough information to guarantee that this is the case. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
