This statement means that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is red. This is because the given statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the apple and the banana in the reverse direction. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
