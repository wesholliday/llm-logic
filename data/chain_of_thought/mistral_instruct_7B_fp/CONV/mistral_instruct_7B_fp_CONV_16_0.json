            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. This type of statement does not allow us to infer 'If Q, then P' directly. However, we can use the concept of contrapositive to check if the inverse statement 'If Q, then P' could be a valid statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine if 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' is true or false, we cannot infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton' directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
