            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is true, then the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is also true. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding, but it does not tell us that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must also be at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
