This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it follows that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of the statement is 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt'. This means that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then it follows that Lisa bought the red shirt. But it does not mean that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
