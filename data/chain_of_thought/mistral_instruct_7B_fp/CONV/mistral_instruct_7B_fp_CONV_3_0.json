It means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, this does not mean that if the book is a mystery novel, it was necessarily written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
