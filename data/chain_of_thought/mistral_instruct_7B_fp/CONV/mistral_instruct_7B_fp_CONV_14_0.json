It means that if the bear is in the case, then the wolf is in the den. However, this does not mean that if the wolf is in the den, then the bear is in the case. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The statement 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' is not a valid inference from the given statement."
