It means that if the room was cleaned at all, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. However, this does not mean that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'."
