However, the statement does not imply that \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" In fact, the second statement is also a contradiction, but for different reasons.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining'. This is another contradiction and cannot be inferred from the given statement."
