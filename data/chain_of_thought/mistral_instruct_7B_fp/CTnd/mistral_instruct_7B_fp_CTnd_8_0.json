It suggests that if the issue was addressed at all, it was not done so effectively. However, this does not mean that if the issue was addressed effectively, it was not addressed at all. In fact, the two statements are logically opposite to each other.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed' from the original statement."
