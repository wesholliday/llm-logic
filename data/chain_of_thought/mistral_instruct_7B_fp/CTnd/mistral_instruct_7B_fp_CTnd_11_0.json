            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'I went to the store' and Q is 'I did not buy vegetables'. This statement means that if the condition P (going to the store) is true, then the consequence Q (not buying vegetables) is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' is a different conditional statement with the condition 'I bought vegetables' and the consequence 'I did not go to the store'. This statement is not logically followable from the given statement.\n\nThe reason is that the given statement only tells us that if the person went to the store, then they did not buy vegetables. It does not imply that if they bought vegetables, then they did not go to the store. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The statement 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' cannot be inferred from the given statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables'."
