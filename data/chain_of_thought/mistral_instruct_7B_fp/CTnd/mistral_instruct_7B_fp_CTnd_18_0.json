It suggests that if an issue is discussed, it cannot also be discussed in depth at the same time. However, this is not logically possible. Discussing an issue and discussing it in depth are two different things. One does not necessarily exclude the other. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
