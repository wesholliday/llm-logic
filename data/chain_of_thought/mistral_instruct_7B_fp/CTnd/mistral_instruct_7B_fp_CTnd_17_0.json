It suggests that if the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly, which is not logically possible. However, the statement 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted' is a different statement and cannot be inferred from the given statement. It is a contradiction in its own right, as it suggests that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted at all.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted' from 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly'."
