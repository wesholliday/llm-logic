This is a paradox, as it suggests two contradictory things at the same time.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the given statement: 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.'\n\nThis statement is also a contradiction, as it suggests that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not study at all. This is not logically possible, as studying diligently implies that Ben studied in the first place.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
