This implies that the clothes were washed, but at the same time, they were not washed properly. However, this does not allow us to make any conclusions about the opposite statement, 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed'. This statement is not logically equivalent to the given statement and cannot be inferred from it.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed'."
