Here, P is 'a recommendation was made' and Q is 'it was not a strong recommendation'. This statement is a contradiction, meaning that both P and Q cannot be true at the same time.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. This is a different conditional statement, where P is 'a strong recommendation was made' and Q is 'a recommendation was not made'.\n\nThe given statement does not provide enough information to infer this new conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot make this inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
