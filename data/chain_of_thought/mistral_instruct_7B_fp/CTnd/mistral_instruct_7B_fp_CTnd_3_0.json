It means that if the first condition (eating a meal) is true, then the second condition (not eating a large meal) must also be true. However, this contradicts the common understanding that if you eat a meal, you are also eating something, which is a large meal or a small one.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal'. This statement is also a contradiction. It means that if you eat a large meal, then you did not eat any meal at all. This is not logically possible, as eating a large meal is still considered eating a meal.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal' from 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal'. Both statements are contradictions and cannot be logically inferred from each other."
