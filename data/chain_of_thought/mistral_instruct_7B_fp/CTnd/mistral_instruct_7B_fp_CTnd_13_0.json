This is a contradiction because exercising and not exercising much are two opposite actions.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.'\n\nThis statement is also a contradiction. Exercising much implies that Alex did a significant amount of exercise, which is the opposite of not exercising. Therefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.'\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
