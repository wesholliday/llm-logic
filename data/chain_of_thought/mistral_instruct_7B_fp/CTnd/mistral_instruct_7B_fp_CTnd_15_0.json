It means that if the room was tidied at all, then it was not tidied thoroughly. This does not imply that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The statement 'If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied' is not a valid inference from the given statement."
