Contrapositive is a logical statement that reverses the subject and the predicate of the original statement while keeping the logical operator the same. In this case, the original statement could be 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were provided'.\n\nHowever, the given statement does not imply the contrapositive 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided'. The given statement is a statement of ambiguity or confusion, not a statement of contradiction. Therefore, we cannot infer that if directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
