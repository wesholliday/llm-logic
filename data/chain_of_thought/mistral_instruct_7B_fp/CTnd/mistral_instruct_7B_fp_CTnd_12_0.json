This is a paradox, and it means that the condition 'Jane studied' is not a valid one.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study'. This statement is also a contradiction, and it can be understood as follows:\n\n1. If Jane studied long, then she must have spent a significant amount of time studying.\n2. However, the given statement states that if Jane studied, then she did not study long.\n3. Therefore, the condition 'Jane studied long' is also not a valid one.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study' from 'If Jane studied, then she did not study long'. Both statements are contradictions and cannot be true at the same time."
