This is an impossible situation, as a job cannot be both completed and not completed well at the same time.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the given statement: 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed'. This statement is also a contradiction, as a job that is completed well has been done satisfactorily, which is the opposite of not being completed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
