However, it does not necessarily imply that the software will be updated and then restarted. The decision to restart the software after an update is not always automatic and depends on various factors such as the update type, system settings, and user preferences. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The software might be updated and restarted' based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
