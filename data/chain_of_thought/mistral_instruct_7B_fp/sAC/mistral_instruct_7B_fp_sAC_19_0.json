            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' means that whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball. The second statement 'Jen watched basketball' tells us that Jen did watch basketball at some point. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football as well. The 'if-then' statement only establishes a relationship between Tom and Jen's watching habits, but it does not guarantee that Tom watched football when Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'Tom watched football' is true."
