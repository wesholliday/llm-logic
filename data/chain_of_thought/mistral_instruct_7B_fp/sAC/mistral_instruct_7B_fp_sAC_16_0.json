            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement. It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. The second statement 'The pants were denim' is a fact that the pants are made of denim.\n\nTo determine if 'The shirt was cotton' is true, we need to check if the first condition (the shirt being cotton) is necessary for the second condition (the pants being denim) to be true. In other words, we need to check if the shirt being cotton is a sufficient condition for the pants being denim.\n\nSince we know that the pants are denim, it means that the condition 'the pants were denim' is satisfied. However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition 'the shirt was cotton' is also satisfied. The fact that the pants are denim does not guarantee that the shirt is cotton.\n\nTherefore, even though 'The pants were denim' is true, it does not follow that 'The shirt was cotton' is true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
