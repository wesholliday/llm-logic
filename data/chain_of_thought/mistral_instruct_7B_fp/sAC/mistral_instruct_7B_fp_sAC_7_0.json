It means that if the first part (Alex finished the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Chris finished the race is true'. This means that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, we need to check if the first part of the conditional statement is also true. If it is, then according to the conditional statement, the second part (Chris finished the race) must also be true.\n\nSo, the question is asking if the first part (Alex finished the race) is also true, given that the second part (Chris finished the race) is true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Since the conditional statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', and we know that 'Chris finished the race is true', it follows that 'Alex finished the race' must also be true. This is because the conditional statement tells us that if the first part is true, then the second part must also be true. And since we know that the second part is true, then the first part must also be true."
