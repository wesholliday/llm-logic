This means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. If the second part (Kate ate salad) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true.\n\nNow, we are given that 'Kate ate salad' is true. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true. But it does not mean that the first part (Ben ate pasta) is also true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'Ben ate pasta' is true."
