This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the dog being inside) is true, then the second part (the cat being outside) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The cat was outside'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the first part (the dog being inside) is true based on the given information. If the second part (the cat being outside) is true, then according to the conditional statement, the first part must also be false (because the dog cannot be inside if the cat is outside). However, the question asks if the first part is true, not false. Since the question does not provide any information to the contrary, we cannot assume that the first part is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say whether 'The dog was inside' is true or false.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot determine if 'The dog was inside' is true or false based on the given information."
