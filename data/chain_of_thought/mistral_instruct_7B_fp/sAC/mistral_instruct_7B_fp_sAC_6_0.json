The second statement 'Bob chose pasta' tells us that Bob did indeed choose pasta. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It only tells us that the condition in the first statement is not met (Sue did not choose pizza). Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Sue chose pizza' is true based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
