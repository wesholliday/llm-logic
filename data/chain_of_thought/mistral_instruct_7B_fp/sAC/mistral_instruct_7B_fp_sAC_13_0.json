            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The truck was blue'.\n\nTo determine if 'The car was red' is true, we need to check if the first part of the conditional statement (the car being red) is true, given that the second part (the truck being blue) is true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'The car was red' is true. The given information only tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, and that the truck was blue. It does not provide any information about the color of the car. Therefore, it is still possible that the car was not red."
