This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This means that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the original conditional statement again. Since we know that 'Sue was at the wedding' is true (which is the second part of the conditional statement), it means that the first part of the conditional statement must also be true. In other words, if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have also been at the wedding.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it follows that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
