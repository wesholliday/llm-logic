            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the first part (the apple being red) is also true, given that the second part (the banana being yellow) is true. This is done by using the principle of contrapositive, which states that if 'If P then Q' is a conditional statement, then 'If not Q then not P' is also a conditional statement that is logically equivalent to the original one.\n\nApplying this principle to our given statement, we get 'If not yellow (banana), then not red (apple)'. Since we know that 'The banana was yellow' is true, then 'not yellow (banana)' must be false. Therefore, according to the principle of contrapositive, 'not red (apple)' must also be false. This means that 'The apple was red' is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
