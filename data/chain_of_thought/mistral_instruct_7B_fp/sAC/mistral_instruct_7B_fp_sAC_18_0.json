The second statement 'The truck was metal' is a fact that the truck is made of metal.\n\nTo determine if 'The doll was plastic' is true, we need to check if the first condition (the doll being plastic) leads to the second condition (the truck being metal), given that the second condition is already true.\n\nSince the second condition is true (the truck is metal), and the conditional statement says that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, it means that the doll must be plastic as well.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
