The second statement 'Erin took a train' is a fact that Erin indeed took a train. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. The truth of the first statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' depends on the relationship between Sam and Erin's modes of transportation. If we only know that Erin took a train, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'Sam took a plane' is true."
