            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. This statement tells us that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the first statement (Lisa buying the red shirt) is also true, given that the second statement (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second part of the condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true, then according to the rule of conditional statements, the first part of the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
