            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is a conditional statement. It means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. The second statement 'The unicorn was in the forest' is a fact that the unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\nHowever, the fact that the unicorn is in the forest does not necessarily mean that the griffin is also in the forest. The conditional statement only tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. It does not say that the griffin is actually in the forest.\n\nTherefore, even though the unicorn is in the forest, it does not follow that the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that 'The griffin was in the forest' is true."
