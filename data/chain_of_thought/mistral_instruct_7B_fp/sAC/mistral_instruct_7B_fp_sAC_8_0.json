This is a conditional statement. The second statement 'The mummy was awake' is a fact that the mummy is awake.\n\nTo determine if 'The vampire was awake' is true, we need to check if the first condition (the vampire being awake) is true given that the second condition (the mummy being awake) is true. Since the second condition is true, according to the conditional statement, the first condition (the vampire being awake) must also be true for the second condition to hold.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
