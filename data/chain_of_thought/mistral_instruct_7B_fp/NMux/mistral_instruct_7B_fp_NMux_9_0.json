This implies that there is at least one scenario where the twonk was not plinked. However, it does not necessarily mean that the twonk was not plinked in all scenarios. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that 'The twonk might not have been plinked'. But, we can infer that it is possible that 'The twonk might not have been plinked'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it can be inferred."
