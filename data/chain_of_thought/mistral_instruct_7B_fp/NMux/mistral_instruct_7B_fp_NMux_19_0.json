This statement does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled, but it does imply that it was not necessary for the smonk to be vreebled.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that 'The smonk might not have been vreebled'. This is because if it was not necessary for the smonk to be vreebled, then it is possible that it was not vreebled at all. However, it is important to note that this is an inference, and it is not necessarily true. There could still be situations where the smonk was vreebled, even if it was not necessary.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
