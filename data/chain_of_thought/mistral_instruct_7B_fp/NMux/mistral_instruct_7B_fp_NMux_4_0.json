This implies that there is at least one possible scenario where the fribble was not snurgled. However, this does not mean that the fribble was definitely not snurgled in all possible scenarios. It only means that it is not necessary or required that it was. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The fribble might not have been snurgled'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
