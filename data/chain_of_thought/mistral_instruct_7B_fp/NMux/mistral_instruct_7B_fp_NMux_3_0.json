            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' means that there is no necessity or requirement for the splat to have been morphed. This statement does not rule out the possibility that the splat was morphed, but it also does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the splat was morphed. Therefore, based on this information, we cannot conclude that the splat was morphed, but we also cannot conclude that it was not morphed. However, since the statement does not imply that the splat was not morphed, we cannot infer 'The splat must have been morphed'. Instead, a more neutral statement would be 'The splat might not have been morphed'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
