            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' means that the grommet being sploffed is not a necessary condition. This means that the grommet could have been in a state other than sploffed. Therefore, it is possible that the grommet was not sploffed. However, this does not mean that the grommet was definitely not sploffed, only that it was not necessary for it to be sploffed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet definitely might not have been sploffed'. But we can infer 'The grommet might not have been sploffed' as a possibility.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
