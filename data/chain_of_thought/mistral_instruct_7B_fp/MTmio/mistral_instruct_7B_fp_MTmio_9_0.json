'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' - This statement suggests that there's a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' - This conditional statement means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark is guaranteed to have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' based on the given statements. The first statement only suggests that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, and the second statement is a conditional statement that tells us that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. However, it does not provide any information about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not."
