The second statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' is a conditional statement that suggests that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, this statement does not provide any information about the actual state of the vampire.\n\nSince the first statement does not definitively state that the mummy is awake, and the second statement does not definitively state that the vampire is awake, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
