This statement implies that if Sue chooses pizza, it is not possible for Bob to have chosen pasta.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about what Sue actually chose. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
