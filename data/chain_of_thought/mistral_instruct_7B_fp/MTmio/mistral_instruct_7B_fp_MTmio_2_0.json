The second statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest' is a conditional statement with an implication that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about the presence or absence of the griffin in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
