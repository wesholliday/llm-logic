The second statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race' is a conditional statement that suggests if Alex finished the race, then it is a certainty that Chris finished the race as well.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'Alex did not finish the race' from these two statements. The second statement does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not. It only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished as well. But it does not tell us that Alex did finish.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
