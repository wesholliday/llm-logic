The second statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about Jeff's actual participation in basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
