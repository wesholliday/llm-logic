The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe's visit to the park and Lucy's visit to the zoo, stating that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy must go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about Joe's visit to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
