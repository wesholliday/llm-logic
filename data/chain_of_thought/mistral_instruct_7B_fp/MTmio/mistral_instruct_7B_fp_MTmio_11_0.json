This statement only suggests that the muffins could have been something other than blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nThe second statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry' is a conditional statement that suggests a relationship between the cake and the muffins. However, this statement does not mean that the cake is actually chocolate. It only means that if the cake were chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
