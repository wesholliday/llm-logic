The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue, stating that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also be present.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about Mary's actual presence at the wedding. Therefore, it is not possible to infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
