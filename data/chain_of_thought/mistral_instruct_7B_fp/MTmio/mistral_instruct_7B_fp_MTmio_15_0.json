The second statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train' is a conditional statement, meaning that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, it does not mean that Sam actually took a plane.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Sam did not take a plane' based on the given information."
