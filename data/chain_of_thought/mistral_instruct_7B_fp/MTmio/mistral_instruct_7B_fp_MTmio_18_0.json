            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe two statements given are 'The truck might not have been metal' and 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the truck could be made of something other than metal, but it does not necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. It only implies that the truck might be made of a different material.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This does not mean that the doll is plastic, but rather that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The first statement does not rule out the possibility of the truck being metal, and the second statement does not necessarily mean that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on the given statements."
