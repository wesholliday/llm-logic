The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the colors of the car and the truck. It states that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
