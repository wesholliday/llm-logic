The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' is a conditional statement, meaning that if Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball. However, it does not mean that Tom necessarily watches football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
