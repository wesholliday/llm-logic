The second statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside' is also a conditional statement, but it suggests that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about the actual state of the dog. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dog was not inside' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
