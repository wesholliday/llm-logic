            "content": "Explanation:\n\nFirst, let's break down the two statements given:\n1. 'The book might not be a mystery novel' - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel.\n2. 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' - This conditional statement means that if James wrote the book, then the book is guaranteed to be a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, these two statements do not provide enough information to infer that 'The book was not written by James'. The first statement only suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel, but it does not necessarily mean that James did not write it. The second statement tells us that if James wrote it, then it would be a mystery novel, but it does not tell us that he did write it. Therefore, we cannot make the inference that 'The book was not written by James' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James' based on the given information."
