The second statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad' is a conditional statement, meaning that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. However, it does not mean that if Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
