The second statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den' is a conditional statement that suggests that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, it does not mean that the bear is actually in the cave. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The bear was not in the cave' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
