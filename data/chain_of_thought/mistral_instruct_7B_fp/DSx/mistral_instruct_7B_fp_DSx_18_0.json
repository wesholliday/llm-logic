The second statement 'The shank is not nugged' tells us that the shank is not in the nugged state. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shank is in the plooked state. It only means that the shank is not in the nugged state. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shank is plooked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
