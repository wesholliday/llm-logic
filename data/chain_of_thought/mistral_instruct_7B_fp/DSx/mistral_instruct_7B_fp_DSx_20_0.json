The second statement 'The fleeg is not surned' negates the second condition in the disjunction, making it false. However, this does not necessarily mean that the first condition (the fleeg is bluttered) is true. The two statements do not provide enough information to infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' based on the given information."
