The second statement 'The flob is not movated' tells us that the flob is not in a state of movated. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flob is in a state of skizzled. It only means that the flob is not in a state of movated, and we cannot infer anything about its state of skizzled based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled' based on 'Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated' and 'The flob is not movated'."
