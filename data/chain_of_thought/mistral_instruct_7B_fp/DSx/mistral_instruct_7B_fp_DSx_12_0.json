This statement means that the smip can be in one of two states: either shripped or lupped. However, it does not specify that the smip cannot be in both states at the same time or that it must be in one state.\n\nNext, we have 'The smip is not lupped'. This statement means that the smip is not in the lupped state. However, it does not necessarily mean that the smip is in the shripped state.\n\nSince 'The smip is not lupped' does not contradict 'Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped', we cannot infer that 'The smip is shripped' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
