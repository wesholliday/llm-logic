'Either' means one or the other, but not both. So, if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled according to this statement.\n\nHowever, the second statement 'The sneg is not sproted' does not necessarily mean that the sneg is crampled. It only means that the sneg is not sproted, not that it is crampled.\n\nTherefore, while the first statement suggests that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled, the second statement does not provide enough information to confirm that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The sneg is crampled' based on the given statements."
