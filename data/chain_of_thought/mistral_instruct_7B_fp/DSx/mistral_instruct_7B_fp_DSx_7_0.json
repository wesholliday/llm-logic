The second statement 'The whiffle is not tinked' means that the whiffle is not in the state of being tinked. However, this statement does not provide any information about the state of the whiffle being shanked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle is shanked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
