However, the second statement tells us that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, we need to consider if the first statement can still be true, given that the second statement is also true. In other words, can the flugel be blimmed if it is not zargled?\n\nThe statement 'Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled' does not specify that the flugel cannot be blimmed if it is not zargled. Therefore, it is still possible for the flugel to be blimmed, even though we know it is not zargled.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
