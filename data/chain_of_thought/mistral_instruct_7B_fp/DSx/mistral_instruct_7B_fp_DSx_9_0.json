It does not specify that the twonk is in the plinked state.\n\nThe second statement 'The twonk is not plinked' means that the twonk is not in the plinked state.\n\nSince the twonk is not in the plinked state, it must be in the other state mentioned in the first statement, which is 'varnished'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
