The second statement 'The grommet is not plopped' means that the grommet is not in the state of being plopped. However, this statement does not provide any information about the state of the grommet being sploffed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet is sploffed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
