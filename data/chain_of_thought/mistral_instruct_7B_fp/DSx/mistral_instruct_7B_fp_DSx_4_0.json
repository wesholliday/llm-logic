The second statement 'The fribble is not crinked' tells us that the fribble is not in the crinked state. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fribble is in the snurgled state. It could be in a state that we do not know about, as the statement 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked' does not exclude the possibility of other states.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fribble is snurgled' based on the given information."
