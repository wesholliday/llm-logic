'Fleeked' and 'snugged' are presumably two different states or conditions that the clug can be in.\n\nThe second statement 'The clug is not snugged' means that the clug is not in the state of being 'snugged'.\n\nHowever, this statement does not provide any information about the state of being 'fleeked'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The clug is fleeked' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
