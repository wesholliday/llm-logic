However, it does not necessarily mean that the glip is in the 'slogged' state. The glip could still be in the 'slogged' state, but the statement 'The glip is not tragged' does not provide enough information to infer that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
