The second sentence 'Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged' means that the glip is either in a state of 'slogged' or 'tragged', but not both at the same time. Since we know that the glip is not 'tragged', this leaves us with the possibility that the glip is 'slogged'. However, without more information, we cannot definitively say that 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' based on the given information."
