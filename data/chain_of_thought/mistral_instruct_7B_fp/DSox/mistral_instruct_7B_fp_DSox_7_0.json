If the whiffle was not tinked, then it cannot be tinked as per the second statement. But the second statement also says that if it's not tinked, then it must be shanked. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
