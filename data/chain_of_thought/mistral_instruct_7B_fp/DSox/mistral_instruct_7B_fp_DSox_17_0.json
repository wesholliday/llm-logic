Therefore, the only option left is 'The flob is skizzled'.\nHowever, without a clear definition of what 'skizzled' means, we cannot definitively say 'yes' or 'no'. We would need more context or information to make a conclusive answer.\nAnswer:\nI'm unable to provide a definitive answer without more context or information about what 'skizzled' means."
