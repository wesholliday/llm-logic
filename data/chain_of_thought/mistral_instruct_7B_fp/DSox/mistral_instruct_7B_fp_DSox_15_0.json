However, the second statement does not exclude the possibility that the dreb is vroombed. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that 'The dreb is vroombed' based on these two statements, but we also cannot say that it is not vroombed either.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' based on the given statements."
