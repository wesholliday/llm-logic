The second statement 'Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged' means that the shank is either in the state 'plooked' or in the state 'nugged'. Since we know that the shank is not in the 'nugged' state, and the second statement tells us that it must be in one of the two states, then the shank must be in the 'plooked' state.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
