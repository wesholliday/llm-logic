The second sentence 'Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped' means that the smip is either in the state of being shripped or in the state of being lupped.\n\nSince we know that the smip is not lupped from the first sentence, and the second sentence tells us that it must be either shripped or lupped, it means that the smip must be in the state of being shripped.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
