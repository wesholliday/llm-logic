The second sentence 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned' means that the fleeg is either dirty or soiled (bluttered) or it is not dirty or soiled (surned).\n\nSince we know from the first sentence that the fleeg is not dirty or soiled, the second sentence tells us that the fleeg must be bluttered. This is because if the fleeg were not bluttered, then it would be surned, but we know from the first sentence that it is not surned.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
