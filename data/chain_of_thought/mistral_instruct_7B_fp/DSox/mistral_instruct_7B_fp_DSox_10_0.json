The second sentence 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled' means that the wug is either in the state of being sproinged or in the state of being garpled. Since we know that the wug is not garpled, it must be in the state of being sproinged, according to the 'either-or' statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
