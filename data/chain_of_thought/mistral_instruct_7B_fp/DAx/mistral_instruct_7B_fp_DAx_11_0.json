This statement is an if-then rule, which means that if the first part (if-clause) is true, then the second part (then-clause) must also be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are given that 'The flug was not blummed'. Since the if-clause is false, we cannot automatically assume that the then-clause is also false. But we can also not assume that it is true, as the given information does not provide enough evidence to support that.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
