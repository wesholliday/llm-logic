However, if the condition is false, it does not necessarily mean that the consequence is also false. In other words, the absence of the condition does not necessarily mean the absence of the consequence.\n\nThe second premise states that the condition (the flob was skizzled) is false. But, as mentioned earlier, the absence of the condition does not necessarily mean the absence of the consequence. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was not movated' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
