            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement. It means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be garpled. However, the second statement 'The wug was not sproinged' tells us that the wug was not sproonged at all. Since the 'if' part of the first statement is not true, we cannot conclude that the 'then' part is also true. In other words, just because the wug was not sproonged, it does not mean that it was not garpled. However, since the 'if' part is not true, we cannot say for sure that the wug was garpled either. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was not garpled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wug was not garpled'."
