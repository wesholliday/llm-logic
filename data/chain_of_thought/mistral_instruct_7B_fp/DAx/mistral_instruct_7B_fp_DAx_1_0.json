However, we cannot directly infer that the consequence is not true from the second premise alone, because the first premise is a conditional statement, and we need to know whether the condition is true or false to determine whether the consequence is true or false.\n\nIn this case, since we know that the condition is not true, we can infer that the consequence is also not true. Therefore, 'The flugel was not zargled' can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
