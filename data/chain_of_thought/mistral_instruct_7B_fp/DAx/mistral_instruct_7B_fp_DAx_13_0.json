However, we cannot directly infer that the consequence is false from the second premise alone, because the conditional statement might have other exceptions or conditions that we are not aware of.\n\nHowever, in the absence of any additional information, we can assume that the consequence is also false, as it follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The glip was not tragged'."
