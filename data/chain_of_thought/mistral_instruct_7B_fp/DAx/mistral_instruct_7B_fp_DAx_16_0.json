            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given premises are 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' and 'The sneg was not crampled'.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true. However, if the condition is false, then the consequence does not necessarily have to be false, but it also does not have to be true. In this case, the condition is 'The sneg was crampled', and it is stated as 'The sneg was not crampled', which means that the condition is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot infer that the consequence is true (i.e., 'The sneg sproted the frink'). However, we can also not infer that the consequence is false, because the premise only states that if the condition is true, then the consequence is also true. It does not state that if the condition is false, then the consequence is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
