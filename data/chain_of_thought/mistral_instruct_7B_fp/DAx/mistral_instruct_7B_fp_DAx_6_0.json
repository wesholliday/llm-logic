            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement, meaning if the grommet was sploffed, then it follows that the grommet plopped the frink. The second statement 'The grommet was not sploffed' negates the first statement, meaning the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement negates the condition, it logically follows that the consequence of the condition (the grommet plopping the frink) cannot occur if the condition itself does not occur. Therefore, we can infer 'The grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
