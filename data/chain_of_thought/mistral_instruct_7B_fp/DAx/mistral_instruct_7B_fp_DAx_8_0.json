            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the sprocket was cranked, then it follows that the sprocket was daggled. The second statement 'The sprocket was not cranked' means that the sprocket was not turned or rotated by a crank.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. If the sprocket was not cranked, then according to the first statement, the sprocket should not be daggled. Therefore, it seems that we can infer 'The sprocket was not daggled'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
