It means that if the zinger is fraggled, then it must also be smoogled. The second statement 'The zinger was not fraggled' means that the zinger is not in the state of being fraggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the logic of the two statements together. If the zinger is not fraggled, then according to the first statement, it should not be smoogled either. This is because the condition for the zinger to be smoogled is that it must be fraggled first.\n\nSo, if the zinger is not fraggled, then it cannot be smoogled. Therefore, we can infer 'The zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
