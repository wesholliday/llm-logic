The second statement 'The whiffle was not shanked' means the whiffle was hit well.\n\nSince the whiffle was hit well (not shanked), according to the first statement, it should not have tinked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle did not tink' directly from the given statements, but it is a reasonable assumption based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The whiffle did not tink' directly from the given statements, but it is a reasonable assumption based on the information provided."
