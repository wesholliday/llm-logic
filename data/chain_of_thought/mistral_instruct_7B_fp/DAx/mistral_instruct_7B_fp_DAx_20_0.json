However, the second statement tells us that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTo infer whether the fleeg did not surn, we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, it means that if the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the consequence (it surned) must also be true. But in this case, the condition is not true (the fleeg was not bluttered), so the consequence cannot be true either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg did surn.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg did not surn'."
