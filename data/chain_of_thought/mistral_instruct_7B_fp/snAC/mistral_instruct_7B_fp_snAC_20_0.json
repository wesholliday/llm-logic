The second statement 'The banana was yellow' is a fact that the banana is indeed yellow. However, the first statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple. It only states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. Therefore, even though the banana is yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple is red.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The apple was red' is true."
