This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. This statement is telling us that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us that Lisa bought the red shirt. It only tells us that if she did, then Mark would also buy the blue shirt. But it does not guarantee that Lisa actually bought the red shirt.\n\nSo, even though Mark bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
