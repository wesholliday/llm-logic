The second statement 'The pants were denim' is a fact that the pants are made of denim.\n\nHowever, the truth of the first statement does not necessarily mean that the shirt is also true. The conditional statement only tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. It does not tell us that the shirt is actually cotton. Therefore, even if the pants are denim, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The shirt was cotton' is true."
