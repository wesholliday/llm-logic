            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The truck was metal'.\n\nTo determine if 'The doll was plastic' is necessarily true, we need to check if the first part of the conditional statement (the doll being plastic) is consistent with the second part being true (the truck being metal).\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The doll was plastic' is true. The truth of 'The doll was plastic' is not guaranteed even if 'The truck was metal' is true, because the conditional statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. It does not say that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic. Therefore, it is possible for the truck to be metal without the doll being plastic."
