            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the two statements. Since the second statement (Sue was at the wedding) is a part of the first statement (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding), we know that the first statement is a valid one. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us whether Mary was at the wedding or not. It only tells us that Sue was there. Therefore, even though it is logically possible that Mary was also at the wedding (given the first statement), we cannot definitively say that she was there based on the information provided in the second statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true."
