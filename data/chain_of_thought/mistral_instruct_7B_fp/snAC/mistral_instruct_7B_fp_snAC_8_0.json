            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This is a conditional statement. The second statement 'The mummy was awake' is a fact that the mummy is currently awake.\n\nTo determine if 'The vampire was awake' is true, we need to check if the first condition (the vampire being awake) is true given that the second condition (the mummy being awake) is true. Since the second condition is true, according to the conditional statement, the first condition (the vampire being awake) must also be true for the statement to hold.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to definitively say that the vampire is awake. The statement 'The mummy was awake' only tells us that the mummy is awake, not the vampire. Therefore, while it is logically possible that the vampire is awake, we cannot say for certain that 'The vampire was awake' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The vampire was awake' is true. While it is logically possible, we cannot say for certain based on the given information."
