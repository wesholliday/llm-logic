The second statement 'Amy played tennis' tells us that Amy did play tennis, but it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. The truth of the first statement depends on the relationship between Jeff and basketball, which we do not have enough information to determine based on the second statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Jeff played basketball' is true."
