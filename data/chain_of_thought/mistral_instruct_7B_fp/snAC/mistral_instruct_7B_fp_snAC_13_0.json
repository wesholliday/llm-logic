            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It means that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. The second statement 'The truck was blue' is a fact that the truck is blue. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the car is red. The truth of the first statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' depends on the color of the car, not the color of the truck. Therefore, even if 'The truck was blue' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'The car was red' is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The car was red' is true."
