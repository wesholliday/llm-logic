The second statement 'The cat was outside' is given as true.\n\nTo determine if 'The dog was inside' is also true, we need to check if the first condition (the dog being inside) leads to the second condition (the cat being outside), which is given as true.\n\nSince the second condition is true, it means that the first condition must also be true, as the first condition is the necessary condition for the second condition to be true. Therefore, 'The dog was inside' must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
