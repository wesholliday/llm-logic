The second statement 'Kate ate salad' is a fact that Kate indeed ate salad. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. The 'if-then' statement only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not guarantee that Ben actually ate pasta.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Ben ate pasta' is true."
