The second statement 'Erin took a train' is a fact that Erin indeed took a train. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane as well. The 'if-then' statement only establishes a relationship between the two events, but it does not guarantee that both events occurred.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Sam took a plane' is true."
