The second statement 'Bob chose pasta' is a fact that Bob indeed chose pasta. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It only means that Bob chose pasta, which is consistent with the first statement, but it does not prove that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Sue chose pizza' is true."
