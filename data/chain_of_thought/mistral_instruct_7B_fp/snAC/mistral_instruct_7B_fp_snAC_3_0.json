However, the converse is not necessarily true, meaning that if the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean that James wrote it.\n\nNow, given that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true, this means that the book falls under the category of mystery novels. But this does not necessarily mean that James wrote it.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
