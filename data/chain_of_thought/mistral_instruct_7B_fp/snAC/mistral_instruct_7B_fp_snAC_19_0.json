            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' means that whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball. The second statement 'Jen watched basketball' tells us that Jen did watch basketball at some point. However, this does not necessarily mean that Tom also watched football. The first statement only tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. It does not say that Tom always watches football or that he watched football on the same occasion when Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'Tom watched football' is true."
