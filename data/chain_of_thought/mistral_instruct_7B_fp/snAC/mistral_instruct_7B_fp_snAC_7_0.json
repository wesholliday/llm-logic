            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Alex finished the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Chris finished the race is true'. This means that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, we need to check if the first part of the conditional statement is also true. If it is, then the entire conditional statement is true. If it's not, then the conditional statement is still true, but its truth value does not depend on the second statement.\n\nSo, the question is asking if 'Alex finished the race' is also true, given that 'Chris finished the race' is true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.\n\nExplanation for the answer:\nSince 'Chris finished the race' is true, and the conditional statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', it follows that Alex must have also finished the race. This is because the conditional statement is true if and only if both the if-part and the then-part are true. Here, both parts are true, so the entire conditional statement is true. Therefore, Alex must have finished the race."
