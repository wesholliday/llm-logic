This is a conditional statement. The second statement 'The robot visited Jupiter' is a fact, stating that the robot has indeed visited Jupiter.\n\nHowever, the fact that the robot visited Jupiter does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. The conditional statement only tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. It does not imply that the alien visited Mars because the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not necessarily follow that 'The alien visited Mars' is true."
