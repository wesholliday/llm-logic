However, it also mentions that the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet. This means that there is a third possibility that the umbrella is neither in the car nor tucked away in the closet. Since the statement does not provide enough information to rule out this third possibility, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
