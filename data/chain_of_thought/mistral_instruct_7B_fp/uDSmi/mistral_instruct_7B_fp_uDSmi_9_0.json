However, the statement also mentions that the missing piece might not be blending in on the floor. This means that even though it's possible that the piece is blending in on the floor, it's not necessarily true. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
