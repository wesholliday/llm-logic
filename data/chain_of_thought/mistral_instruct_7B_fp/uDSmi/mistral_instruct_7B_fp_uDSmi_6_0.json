However, it also mentions that the phone might not be ringing in the kitchen. This means that even though the phone could be in the kitchen and ringing, it is also possible that it is not ringing and is instead in the living room. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
