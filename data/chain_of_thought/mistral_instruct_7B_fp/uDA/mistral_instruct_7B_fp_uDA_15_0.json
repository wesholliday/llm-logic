The second statement tells us that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTo infer whether Erin took a train or not, we need to consider both statements together and see if they are consistent.\n\nIf Sam did not take a plane, then according to the first statement, Erin should have taken a train. However, the second statement contradicts this, as it tells us that Sam did not take a plane, but it does not provide any information about Erin's mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Erin did not take a train based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train."
