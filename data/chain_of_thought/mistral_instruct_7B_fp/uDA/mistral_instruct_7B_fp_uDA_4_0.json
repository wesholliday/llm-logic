The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would visit Jupiter. However, the second statement tells us that the alien did not visit Mars. This does not necessarily mean that the condition in the first statement is not true; it only means that the condition was not met. The robot's visit to Jupiter is still a possibility, but we cannot make that conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter."
