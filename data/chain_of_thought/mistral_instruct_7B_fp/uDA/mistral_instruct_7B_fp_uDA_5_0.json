From statement b, we know that Jeff did not play basketball.\n3. However, we cannot infer anything about Amy playing tennis based on Jeff not playing basketball, because the first statement tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not say that if Jeff does not play basketball, then Amy does not play tennis.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis."
