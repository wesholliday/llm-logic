This means that the condition for the pants being denim (if the shirt was cotton) does not hold true. But it does not necessarily mean that the pants are not denim. The statement only tells us that the pants are not denim if the shirt is cotton, not that they cannot be denim under any other circumstances.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim."
