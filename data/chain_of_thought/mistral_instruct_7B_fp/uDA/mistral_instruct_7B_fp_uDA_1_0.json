However, it also states that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that both statements cannot be true at the same time, as they contradict each other. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding. The given information is inconsistent and does not allow us to draw any reliable conclusions."
