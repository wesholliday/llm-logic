However, the second statement \"The bear was not in the cave\" contradicts the first statement, as it suggests that the bear is not present in the cave. This contradiction does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the wolf's presence in the den.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den based on the given information."
