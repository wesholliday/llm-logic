However, we are also given the information that \"the vampire was not awake.\" This contradicts the first statement, as it suggests that the vampire is not awake, but according to the first statement, if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy should also not be awake. However, we do not have any information to suggest that the mummy is not awake based on the vampire being awake or not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake."
