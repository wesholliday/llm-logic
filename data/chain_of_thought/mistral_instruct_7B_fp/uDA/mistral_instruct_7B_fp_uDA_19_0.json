The second statement tells us that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo infer that Jen did not watch basketball, we would need to have information that contradicts the first statement (if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball). However, the second statement does not contradict the first statement. It only tells us that Tom did not watch football, which does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
