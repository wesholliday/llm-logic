However, the second statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" contradicts the first statement. This means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but according to the first statement, Mark should have bought the blue shirt. But since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it is not clear if the condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt was met. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt."
