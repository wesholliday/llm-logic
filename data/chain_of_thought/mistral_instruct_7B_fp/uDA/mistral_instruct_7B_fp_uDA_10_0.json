The second statement \"The dog was not inside\" tells us that the dog is actually outside the given context.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about the current location of the cat. Since the dog is outside, it does not necessarily mean that the cat is also outside. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside."
