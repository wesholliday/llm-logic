However, the second statement \"The apple was not red\" means that the apple is not red under any condition. Since the first condition (the apple being red) is not met, we cannot infer anything about the banana being yellow or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the banana was not yellow based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow."
