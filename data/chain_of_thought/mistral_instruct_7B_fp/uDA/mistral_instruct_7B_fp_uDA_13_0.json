However, the second statement \"The car was not red\" tells us that the car is not red under any condition. Since the first statement's condition (the car being red) is not met, we cannot infer anything about the truck's color based on the second statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue."
