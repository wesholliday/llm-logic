The second statement tells us that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince we know that Sue did not choose pizza, according to the first statement, this means that Bob cannot have chosen pasta either, because the first statement establishes a direct relationship between Sue's choice of pizza and Bob's choice of pasta.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta. The information given only tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, but we know that Sue did not choose pizza, so we cannot make any conclusions about Bob's choice based on this information alone."
