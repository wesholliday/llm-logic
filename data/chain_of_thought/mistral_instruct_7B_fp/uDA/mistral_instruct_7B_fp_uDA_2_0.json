The second statement \"The griffin was not in the forest\" contradicts the first statement, as it states that the griffin is not present in the forest. However, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the unicorn is not present in the forest, as the presence or absence of the griffin does not necessarily imply the presence or absence of the unicorn. Therefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest."
