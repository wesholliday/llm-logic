However, the second statement \"The cake was not chocolate\" contradicts the first statement. Since the cake is not chocolate, according to the first statement, the muffins should be blueberry. But the second statement tells us that the cake is not chocolate, so we cannot assume that the muffins are blueberry based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry."
