However, the second statement contradicts the first one by stating that the book was not written by James. Since the premise of the first statement (the book being written by James) is false, we cannot draw a conclusion based on that statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel."
