The second statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we would need to show that the first statement (if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo) cannot be true because Joe did not go to the park. However, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first statement is not true. It only means that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Joe goes to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy goes to the zoo) is also true. But if the condition is false (Joe does not go to the park), the consequence does not necessarily have to be false as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
