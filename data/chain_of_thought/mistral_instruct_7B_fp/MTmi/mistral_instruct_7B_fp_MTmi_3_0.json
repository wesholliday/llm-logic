            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. It means that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. The second statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' is a statement of possibility. It means that even if James wrote the book, it is not necessarily a given that it must be a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that James did not write the book. The second statement does not provide enough information to infer that James did not write the book. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
