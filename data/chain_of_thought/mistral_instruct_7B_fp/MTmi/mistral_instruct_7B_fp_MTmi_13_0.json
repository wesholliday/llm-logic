            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement. It means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. The second statement 'The truck might not have been blue' is an indication that the truck could have been any color other than blue. This does not necessarily mean that the car is not red, but it does mean that the conditional statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' does not hold true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
