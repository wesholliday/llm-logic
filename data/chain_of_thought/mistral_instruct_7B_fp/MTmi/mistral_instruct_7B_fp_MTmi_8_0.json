The second statement 'The mummy might not have been awake' is an indication that the mummy's state of being awake is uncertain or possibly not awake.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements directly or indirectly suggests that the vampire is not awake. The second statement only implies that the mummy's state is uncertain, not the vampire's. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
