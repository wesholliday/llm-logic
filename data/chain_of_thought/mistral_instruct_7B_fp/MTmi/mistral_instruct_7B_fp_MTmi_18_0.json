It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. The second statement 'The truck might not have been metal' introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. It suggests that the truck could be something other than metal, such as wood or plastic.\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about the doll. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
