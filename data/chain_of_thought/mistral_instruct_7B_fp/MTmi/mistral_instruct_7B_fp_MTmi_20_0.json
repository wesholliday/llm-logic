It means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. The second statement 'The banana might not have been yellow' suggests that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow.\nHowever, this does not allow us to infer that the apple was not red. The two statements are independent of each other. The fact that the banana might not have been yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was not red.\nAnswer:\nNo."
