This means that if Jeff plays basketball, then it is a certainty that Amy plays tennis. The second statement is 'Amy might not have played tennis'. This means that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not.
