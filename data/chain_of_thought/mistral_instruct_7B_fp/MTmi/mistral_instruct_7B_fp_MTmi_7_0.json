The second statement 'Chris might not have finished the face' suggests that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race. However, this statement does not provide any information about Alex's finish in the race. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
