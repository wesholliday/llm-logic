This means that if Joe goes to the park, then it is a certainty that Lucy goes to the zoo. The second statement is 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo'. This means that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about Joe going to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park' based on these statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
