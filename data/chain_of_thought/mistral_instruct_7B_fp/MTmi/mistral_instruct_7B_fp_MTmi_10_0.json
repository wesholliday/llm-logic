It means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. The second statement 'The cat might not have been outside' means that there is a possibility that the cat was not outside.\nHowever, this statement does not provide any information about the dog being inside or outside. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dog was not inside' based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
