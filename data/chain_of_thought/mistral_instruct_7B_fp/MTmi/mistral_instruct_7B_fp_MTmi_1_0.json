This means that if Mary is at the wedding, then it is a certainty that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue might not have been at the wedding'. This means that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about Mary's presence at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary is there, Sue must be there as well. The second statement only tells us that Sue might not be there, but it does not tell us anything about Mary.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
