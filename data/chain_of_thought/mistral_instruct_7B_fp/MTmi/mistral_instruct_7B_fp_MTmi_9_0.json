            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. The second statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' is an indication that Mark's buying the blue shirt is not certain.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about Lisa buying the red shirt. The first statement does not say that Lisa definitely bought the red shirt, and the second statement does not say that she did not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
