This is a conditional statement, meaning if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. The second statement is 'The pants might not have been denim'. This statement introduces a possibility that the pants are not denim, even if the shirt is cotton. However, it does not provide any information about the shirt itself. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
