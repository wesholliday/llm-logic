It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, the second statement 'The muffins might not have been blueberry' introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. It suggests that even if the cake was chocolate, the muffins could still have been something other than blueberry. This contradiction means that we cannot infer anything definitive about the cake's flavor based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The cake was not chocolate'."
