It means that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin must take a train. The second statement 'Erin might not have taken a train' is a possibility statement, indicating that Erin might not have followed the rule in the first statement.\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about Sam taking a plane. The second statement does not contradict the first one, as it only talks about Erin and not Sam. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sam did not take a plane' based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
