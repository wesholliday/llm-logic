This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (griffin in the forest) is true, then the second part (unicorn in the forest) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The unicorn might not have been in the forest'. This statement introduces a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest, but it does not necessarily mean that the unicorn was not in the forest. It only means that it is a possibility.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement does not contradict the first statement, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
