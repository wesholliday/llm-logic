The second statement is 'Kate might not have eaten salad'. This means that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
