It means that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must choose pasta. The second statement 'Bob might not have chosen pasta' means that it is possible for Bob not to have chosen pasta, even if Sue chose pizza.\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about Sue's choice. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
