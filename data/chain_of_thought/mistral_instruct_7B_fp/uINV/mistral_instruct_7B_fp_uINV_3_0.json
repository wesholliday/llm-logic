It means that if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) is also true. However, this does not mean that if the condition is false (the book was not written by James), then the consequence must also be false (the book is not a mystery novel). It only means that the consequence is not necessarily true when the condition is false. In other words, the fact that the book is not a mystery novel if it was not written by James does not follow logically from the fact that it is a mystery novel if it was written by James.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel."
