It means that if a certain condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then another event (Lucy going to the zoo) is also true. However, this statement does not imply that if the first condition is false (Joe did not go to the park), then the second event is also false (Lucy did not go to the zoo). This is because the statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is because the statement does not provide enough information to make that inference."
