However, it does not imply that if Sue does not choose pizza, Bob must also not choose pasta. This is because the statement only establishes a relationship between Sue's choice of pizza and Bob's choice of pasta, but it does not exclude the possibility that Bob might choose something else if Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta."
