            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, this does not mean that if the condition is false (the apple is not red), then the consequence must also be false (the banana is not yellow). This is because the statement only establishes a relationship between the apple and the banana when the apple is red, not when it is not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow."
