However, it does not mean that if the first part is false (the shirt is not cotton), then the second part must also be false (the pants are not denim). It only means that if the first part is true, then the second part must be true, but if the first part is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the second part.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. The given statement only tells us about the relationship between cotton shirts and denim pants, but it does not tell us anything about other types of shirts and pants."
