This type of statement does not allow us to make a direct inverse conclusion, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nHowever, we can analyze the given information and make an educated guess. The statement suggests a direct correlation between the type of cake and the type of muffins. If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. But it does not imply that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins must be something other than blueberry. It could be any other type of muffin.\n\nSo, while it's possible that the muffins could be something other than blueberry if the cake is not chocolate, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry."
