However, it does not mean that if the first part is false (doll not being plastic), then the second part must also be false (truck not being metal). It only means that if the first part is true, the second part must be true, but if the first part is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the second part.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal."
