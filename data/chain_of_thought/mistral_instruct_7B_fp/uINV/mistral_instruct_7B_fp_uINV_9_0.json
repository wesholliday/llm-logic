            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" means that whenever Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark buys the blue shirt. However, it does not imply that if Lisa does not buy the red shirt, Mark necessarily does not buy the blue shirt. This is because the statement only establishes a relationship between the two events (Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt), but it does not exclude the possibility of Mark buying the blue shirt even if Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt."
