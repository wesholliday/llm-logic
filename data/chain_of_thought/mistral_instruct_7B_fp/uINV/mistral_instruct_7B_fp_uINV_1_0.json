            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It means that if a certain condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then another event (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, this statement does not provide enough information to infer the opposite condition, that is, if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is because the statement does not indicate a direct relationship between Mary's absence and Sue's absence.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding."
