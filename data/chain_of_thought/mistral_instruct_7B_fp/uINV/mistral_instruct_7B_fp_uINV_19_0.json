However, it does not mean that if the first part is false (Tom did not watch football), then the second part must also be false (Jen did not watch basketball). This is because the statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. The given statement only tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. It does not tell us anything about what Jen does when Tom does not watch football."
