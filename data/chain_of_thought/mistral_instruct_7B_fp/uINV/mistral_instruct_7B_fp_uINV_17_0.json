However, it does not mean that if Kate eats salad, then Ben eats pasta. It also does not mean that if Ben does not eat pasta, then Kate does not eat salad.\n\nTo infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad, we would need an additional piece of information. For example, if we know that Ben and Kate always eat the same type of food, then we could infer that if Ben does not eat pasta, then Kate does not eat salad as well. But without this additional information, we cannot make such an inference based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad based on the given statement alone."
