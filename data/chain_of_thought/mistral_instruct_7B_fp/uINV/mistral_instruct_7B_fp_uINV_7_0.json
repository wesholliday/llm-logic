This is a conditional statement that follows the 'if-then' structure. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Alex does not finish the race. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. We cannot infer that based on the given information."
