It means that if one event (Jeff playing basketball) occurs, then another event (Amy playing tennis) also occurs. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. The converse is \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" This means that if one event (Amy playing tennis) occurs, then the other event (Jeff playing basketball) also occurs. But this does not mean that if the first event (Amy not playing tennis) occurs, then the second event (Jeff not playing basketball) also occurs. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
