            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true. However, it does not imply that if the condition is false (the car is not red), then the consequence must also be false (the truck is not blue). This is because the statement does not provide any information about what color the truck is if the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue."
