            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the first condition (bear in the cave) is true, then the second condition (wolf in the den) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the first condition is false (bear not in the cave), then the second condition must also be false (wolf not in the den). This is not a valid form of logical inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. The given statement only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. It does not tell us anything about the relationship between the bear and the wolf when the bear is not in the cave."
