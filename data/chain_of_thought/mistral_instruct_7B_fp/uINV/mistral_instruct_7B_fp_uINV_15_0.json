However, it does not imply that if Sam does not take a plane, Erin also does not take a train. This is because the statement does not provide any information about what Erin does when Sam does not take a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
