            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first condition (the car being red) is true, then the second condition (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, the second statement given is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This means that even though the first statement suggests that the truck must be blue if the car is red, this is not necessarily true.\n\nThe third statement given is \"Can we infer that the car was not red?\" To infer something means to draw a logical conclusion based on the given information. In this case, we cannot infer that the car was not red. The fact that the truck is not necessarily blue does not mean that the car must be any other color, such as red. The given information does not allow us to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the car was not red."
