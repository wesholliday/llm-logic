This is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then another event (Erin taking a train) must also occur.\n\nThe second statement given is 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.' This means that it is not necessarily true that Erin took a train, even if Sam took a plane.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements directly tells us anything about Sam taking a plane. The first statement only tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must take a train. The second statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that Erin took a train, but it does not tell us anything about Sam.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
