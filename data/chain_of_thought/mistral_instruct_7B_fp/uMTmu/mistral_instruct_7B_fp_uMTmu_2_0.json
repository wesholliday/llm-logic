            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, the second statement is \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that even though the first statement suggests that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn must be as well, there is evidence or information that contradicts this, meaning the unicorn is not necessarily in the forest.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The second statement only tells us that the unicorn is not necessarily in the forest, not that the griffin is not. Therefore, the griffin could still be in the forest, or it could be somewhere else.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest."
