This statement does not contradict the first statement, as it only states that Lucy's going to the zoo is not a necessary consequence of Joe's going to the park.\n\nHowever, the second statement also gives us an additional piece of information: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This means that it is possible for Joe to have gone to the park without Lucy going to the zoo. This is a contradiction to the first statement, which states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park, but we can infer that the first statement is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park."
