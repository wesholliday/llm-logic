However, the second statement given is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that the muffins could have been something other than blueberry.\n\nSince the second statement contradicts the first, it means that the cake being chocolate is not a necessary condition for the muffins being blueberry. In other words, the cake could be something other than chocolate, and the muffins could still be blueberry.\n\nHowever, the statement does not necessarily mean that the cake is not chocolate. It only means that the cake being chocolate is not a sufficient condition for the muffins being blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate."
