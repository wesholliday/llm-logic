The first statement tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished. However, the second statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that Chris finished. This means that it is possible that Alex finished the race and Chris did not, but we cannot make that conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race."
