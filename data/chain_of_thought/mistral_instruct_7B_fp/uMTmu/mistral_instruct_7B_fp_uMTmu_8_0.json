This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the vampire being awake) is true, then the second part (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.' This means that it is not necessarily true that the mummy was awake, even if the vampire was awake. This statement contradicts the first conditional statement.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake. It only means that the mummy's awakeness cannot be inferred from the vampire's awakeness.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information."
