            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, the statement also includes \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This means that even though the conditional statement suggests that the truck must be metal if the doll is plastic, there is some information that contradicts this.\n\nSince we cannot infer that the truck is not metal based on this information, we cannot directly infer that the doll is not plastic either. The statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the doll's material.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic."
