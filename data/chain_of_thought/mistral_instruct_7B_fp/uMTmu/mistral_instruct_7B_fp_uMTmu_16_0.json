However, the statement also mentions that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that even though the first part of the conditional statement might be true (the shirt being cotton), the second part is not necessarily true (the pants being denim). Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton."
