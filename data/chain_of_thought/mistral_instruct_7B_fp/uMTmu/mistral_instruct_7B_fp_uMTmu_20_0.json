            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the second statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" means that the banana being yellow is not a necessary condition. This means that even if the apple is red, the banana could still be something other than yellow. However, the statement does not say that the banana is not yellow, only that it is not a necessary condition. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the apple was not red."
