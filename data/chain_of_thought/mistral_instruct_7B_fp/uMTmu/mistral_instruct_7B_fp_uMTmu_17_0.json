The second statement given is \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that Kate must eat salad, even if Ben eats pasta.\nHowever, the second statement also does not mean that Kate definitely did not eat salad. It only means that it is not a necessity that she eats salad.\nThe third statement given is \"Can we infer that Ben did not eat pasta?\" To infer that Ben did not eat pasta, we would need to have information that contradicts the first statement, which is that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate must eat salad. But we do not have such information. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
