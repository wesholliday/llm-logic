The second statement given is \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that Jen watches basketball, even if Tom watches football.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that Tom does not watch football. It only means that Jen does not have to watch basketball, even if Tom watches football. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football."
