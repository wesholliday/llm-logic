The first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must be as well. The second statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that Sue was at the wedding, but it does not tell us that she was not. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding."
