However, the second statement given is a negation of the consequence: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that the consequence is not necessarily true, but it does not necessarily mean that the condition is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave."
