However, the second statement given is \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt, but he is not necessarily required to do so.\n\nThe third statement given is \"Can we infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt?\" To infer something, we are making a conclusion based on the given information. In this case, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The given information does not allow us to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt."
