However, the second statement given is \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that the cat was outside, even if the dog was inside.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the dog was inside. It only means that the cat being outside is not a guaranteed consequence of the dog being inside. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside."
