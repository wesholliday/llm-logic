            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer' is a disjunction, meaning it states that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' negates the first statement, meaning the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nSince the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining option from the first statement is that the keys must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer 'The keys are in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
