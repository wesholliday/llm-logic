            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf, but it does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the toy box either.\n\nHowever, since we know that the toy cannot be on the bookshelf, and the only other option given in the first statement is that the toy is in the toy box, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
