            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two mutually exclusive possibilities. The negation of the first part of this disjunction, 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom', means that the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom. Since the two possibilities are mutually exclusive, if the first one is not true, then the second one must be true. Therefore, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
