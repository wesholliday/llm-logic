The second statement 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist' means that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, but it does not necessarily mean that the watch is charging either. However, since we know that the watch cannot be on his wrist, the only other option left is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
