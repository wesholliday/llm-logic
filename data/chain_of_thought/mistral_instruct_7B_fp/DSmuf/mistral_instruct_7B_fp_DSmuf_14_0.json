The negation of this statement, 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', means that the milk is not necessarily chilling in the fridge, but it does not necessarily mean that the milk is on the counter either. The statement 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' does not provide enough information to infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
