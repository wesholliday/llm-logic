The second statement 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen' means that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, but it does not necessarily mean that the phone is in the living room either.\nHowever, since we know that the phone cannot be ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining option is that the phone must be in the living room.\nAnswer:\nYes."
