The second statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head' means that the sunglasses cannot be necessarily perched on her head. Since neither of the conditions can be true at the same time (the sunglasses cannot be both perched and not perched), the only remaining option is that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
