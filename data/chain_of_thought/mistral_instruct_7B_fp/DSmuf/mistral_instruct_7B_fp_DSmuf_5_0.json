The second statement 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' means that the cookies do not necessarily have to be hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar either.\n\nHowever, since the first statement tells us that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar, and the second statement tells us that they are not hidden in the pantry, we can infer that they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
