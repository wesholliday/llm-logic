The second statement 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet' means that the umbrella is not required to be tucked away in the closet.\n\nSince the umbrella cannot be required to be in both the closet and the car at the same time, and it is not required to be in the closet, the only remaining option is that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
