The second statement 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet' means that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet, but it does not necessarily mean that it is draped over the chair either. However, since we know that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, and we also know that it must be in one of the two states mentioned in the first statement, then the only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
