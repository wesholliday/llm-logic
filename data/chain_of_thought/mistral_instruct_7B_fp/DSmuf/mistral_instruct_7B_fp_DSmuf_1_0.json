The second statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, but it does not rule out the possibility that Fido is inside.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on this information alone. However, it does not mean that Fido is not inside either.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based on the given information."
