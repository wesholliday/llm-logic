The second statement 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack' means that the scarf is not obligated to be on the coat rack.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot directly infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack' is true. The second statement only tells us that the scarf is not required to be on the coat rack, but it does not necessarily mean that the scarf is in the backpack. It could also be in another location where it is not obligated to be. Therefore, we cannot make this conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
