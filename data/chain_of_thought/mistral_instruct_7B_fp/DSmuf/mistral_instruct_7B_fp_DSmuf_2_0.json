The second statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' means that the book is not necessarily resting on the table, but it does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf either.\n\nHowever, since the first statement tells us that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf, and the second statement tells us that the book is not on the table, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
