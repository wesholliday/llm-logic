The statement 'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged' means that the shank is not in the state where it must be nugged.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the shank is in the state where it is plooked. The statement 'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged' only tells us that the shank is not in the state where it must be nugged, but it does not tell us that the shank is in the state where it is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
