The second statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped' means that the first possibility is not true, so the grommet cannot be plopped. However, this does not necessarily mean that the grommet is sploffed. It only means that the grommet cannot be plopped, and since the statement 'Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed' tells us that there are only two possibilities, the only other possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
