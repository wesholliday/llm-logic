The second statement 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged' negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning the smonk does not have to be plagged. However, this does not necessarily mean that the smonk is vreebled, as the disjunction still allows for the possibility that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The smonk is vreebled' based on the given information."
