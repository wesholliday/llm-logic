The second statement 'It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted' negates the first statement, meaning it is not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\n\nHowever, the negation of 'The sneg must be sproted' does not necessarily mean 'The sneg is crampled'. It only means that the sneg is not required to be sproted. The sneg could be in any other state, such as melting, refrozen, or even still in its original form.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
