The second statement 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled' means that the zinger is not required to be smoogled, but it does not necessarily mean that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nHowever, since we know that the zinger cannot be both smoogled and fraggled, and we also know that it is not required to be smoogled, then the only remaining option is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
