'Tinked' refers to hitting the ball correctly, and 'shanked' refers to hitting the ball poorly, often resulting in an errant shot.\n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked' negates the first condition, meaning the whiffle does not have to be hit correctly (tinked). However, this does not necessarily mean that the whiffle was hit incorrectly (shanked).\n\nSince we cannot infer that the whiffle was shanked based on the given information, the answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no."
