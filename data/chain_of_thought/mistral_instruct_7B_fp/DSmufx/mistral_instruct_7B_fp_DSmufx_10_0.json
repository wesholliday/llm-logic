The second statement 'It's not the case that the wug must be garpled' means that the wug is not required to be in the state of being garpled.\n\nSince the wug is not required to be garpled, it must be in the state of being sproinged, according to the first statement. Therefore, we can infer 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
