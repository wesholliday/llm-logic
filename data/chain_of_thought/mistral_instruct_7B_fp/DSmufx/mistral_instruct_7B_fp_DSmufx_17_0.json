The second statement 'It's not the case that the flob must be movated' means that the flob is not required to be moved.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the flob is in a state of skizzled. The statement 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled' does not imply that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. It only means that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
