The second statement 'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed' means that the wug is not required to be bimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The wug is flooped'. The first statement only tells us that the wug can be flooped if it is not required to be bimmed. The second statement tells us that it is not required to be bimmed, but it does not necessarily mean that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
