The second statement, 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked', means that the twonk cannot be plinked.\n\nSince we know that the twonk cannot be plinked, the only remaining option is that the twonk must be varnished. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
