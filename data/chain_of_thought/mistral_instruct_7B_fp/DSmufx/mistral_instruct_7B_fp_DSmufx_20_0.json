The second statement 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned' negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning 'The fleeg is not required to be surned'.\nHowever, the second statement does not negate the second part of the disjunction, meaning 'The fleeg is not necessarily not bluttered'.\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
