The second statement 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged' negates the first condition, meaning the glip is not required to be tragged.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the glip is slogged. The negation of the first statement only eliminates one possibility, but it does not guarantee the truth of the other. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
