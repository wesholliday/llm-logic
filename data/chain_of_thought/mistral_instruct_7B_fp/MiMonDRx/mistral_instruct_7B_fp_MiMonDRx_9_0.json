However, this statement does not necessarily exclude the possibility that 'flimble' could also be 'flim' or 'bimboozle' on its own. Therefore, based on the given statement, we cannot definitively infer 'The flimble might be flim or bimboozle', but it is a possibility that cannot be ruled out.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
