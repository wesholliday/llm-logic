'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'\n\nThe first statement tells us that the cat was not outside the house. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the dog is inside the house, then the cat must be outside.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the actual location of the dog. It only tells us that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. But it does not say that the dog is inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
