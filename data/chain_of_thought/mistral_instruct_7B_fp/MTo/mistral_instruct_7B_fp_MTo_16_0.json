It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, this statement does not provide any information about the actual material of the shirt.\n\nSince we know that the pants are not denim, and the conditional statement does not guarantee that the shirt is cotton, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
