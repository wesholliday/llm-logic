The second statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement, which means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also go to the zoo. However, this statement does not mean that Joe actually went to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
