If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nThe first statement tells us that Kate did not consume the salad. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate eats the salad. However, it does not necessarily mean that Ben eats pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' from these statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' from these statements. The given statements do not provide enough information to make such an inference."
