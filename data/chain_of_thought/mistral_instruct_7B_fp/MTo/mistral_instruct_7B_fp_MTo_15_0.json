This means that Erin did not travel by train.\nThe second statement is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. However, the statement does not imply that Sam actually took a plane.\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Sam did not take a plane' based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo."
