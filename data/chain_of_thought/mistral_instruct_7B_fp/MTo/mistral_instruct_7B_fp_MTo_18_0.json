            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe first statement is 'The truck was not metal'. The second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, meaning it tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, the first statement tells us that the truck is not metal. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both the truck not being metal and the truck being metal if the doll is plastic.\n\nSince we cannot have a contradiction, it means that the condition in the second statement (the doll being plastic) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
