            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'Sue was not at the wedding'. This means that Sue was not present at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. However, the 'if' part of the statement is not true in this case, because we know from the first statement that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nSince the 'if' part of the conditional statement is not true, we cannot draw any conclusions about the 'then' part of the statement. In other words, we cannot infer that 'Sue was at the wedding' based on the fact that Mary was at the wedding, because we know that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, we cannot also infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding' based on the given information. The conditional statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. It does not tell us that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary must also not be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make any conclusions about Mary's attendance at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'."
