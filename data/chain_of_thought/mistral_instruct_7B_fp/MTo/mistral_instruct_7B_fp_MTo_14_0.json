The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nTo infer 'The bear was not in the cave', we would need to show that the condition in the conditional statement is false, which is 'the bear was in the cave'. However, the first statement already tells us that the wolf is not in the den, and the conditional statement does not provide any information that contradicts this. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The bear was not in the cave' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
