            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'The unicorn was not in the forest'. This means that the unicorn is not present in the forest.\nThe second statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\nHowever, since we know that the unicorn is not in the forest from the first statement, it means that the condition in the second statement cannot be true. Therefore, the griffin cannot be in the forest.\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' directly from the given statements. However, we can infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest' is a logical consequence of the given statements."
