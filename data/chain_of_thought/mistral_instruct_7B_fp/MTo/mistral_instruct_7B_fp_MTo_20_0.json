'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'\n\nThe first statement tells us that the banana is not yellow. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the actual color of the apple. It only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. But we know that the banana is not yellow.\n\nSince the second statement does not contradict the first statement, we cannot infer that the apple is not red based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red'."
