The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true. However, the given information does not tell us whether the condition is true or false.\n\nSince we cannot determine whether the alien visited Mars based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
