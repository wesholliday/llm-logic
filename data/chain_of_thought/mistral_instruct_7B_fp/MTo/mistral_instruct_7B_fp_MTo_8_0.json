This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, we know that the mummy is not awake. Therefore, it cannot be the case that the vampire is awake, because if the vampire were awake, then the mummy would also have to be awake, but we know that the mummy is not awake.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake' based on the given information. In fact, we can infer the opposite: 'The vampire was not awake'."
