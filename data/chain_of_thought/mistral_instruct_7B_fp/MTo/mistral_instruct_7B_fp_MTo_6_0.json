If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Bob did not select pasta as his choice.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob will choose pasta. However, we don't have any information about Sue's choice yet.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: 'Can we infer 'Sue did not choose pizza'?'\n\nTo infer that Sue did not choose pizza, we would need to show that her choosing pizza would lead to a contradiction with the given information. But in this case, the given information does not provide such a contradiction.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' based on the given information."
