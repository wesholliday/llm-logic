            "content": "Explanation:\n\nFirst, let's break down the two statements given:\n1. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the consequence in the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: 'Can we infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"?'\n\nTo infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we would need to show that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then a contradiction occurs. But since the first statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and the second statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt, we have a contradiction already. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'."
