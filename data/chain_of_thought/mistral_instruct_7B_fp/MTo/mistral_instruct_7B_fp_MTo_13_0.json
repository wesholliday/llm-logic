            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The truck was not blue' tells us that the truck has a color other than blue. The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, meaning if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the car is red. It only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. Since we know that the truck is not blue, it does not mean that the car must be not red. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
