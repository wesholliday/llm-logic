It means that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. This does not mean that Tom always watches football, only that if he does, then Jen watches basketball.\nHowever, we cannot infer anything about whether Tom actually watched football or not, based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
