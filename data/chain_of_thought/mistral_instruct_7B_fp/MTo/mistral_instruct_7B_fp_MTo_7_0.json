The second statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement that implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. However, the condition in the second statement is not met, as we know from the first statement that Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
