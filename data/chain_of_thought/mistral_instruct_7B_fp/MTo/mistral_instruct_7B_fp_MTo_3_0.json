This means that the book does not fall into the genre of mystery novels.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James' from these two statements. The first statement tells us that the book is not a mystery novel, but it does not tell us who wrote the book. The second statement tells us that if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel, but it does not tell us that James actually wrote the book. Therefore, it is still possible that the book is a mystery novel, written by someone other than James.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
