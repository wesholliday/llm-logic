'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate' from these statements:\n\nThe given statements do not directly provide information about the cake's flavor. The first statement only tells us that the muffins are not blueberry. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only tells us what would happen if the cake is chocolate, but it does not tell us the actual flavor of the cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The cake was not chocolate' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
