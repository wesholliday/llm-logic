            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive reasoning that starts with a conditional statement (if P then Q) and then denies the conclusion (not Q), and infers that the premise (not P) must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. The conclusion is 'The car was not red'. The second premise is 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if denying the conclusion (not P) and denying the consequent (not Q) in the conditional statement (if P then Q) logically implies that the premise (P) must be false.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. Denying the conclusion means 'The car was red' is false. Denying the consequent means 'The truck was blue' is false.\n\nIf 'The car was red' is false, then the conditional statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' cannot be true, because the if-part (the car being red) is false. Therefore, the only way for the argument to be logically valid is if the premise 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is also false. But this premise is a conditional statement, and it can only be false if either the if-part or the consequent is false. Since we've already established that 'The truck was blue' is false, the only way for the argument to be logically valid is if 'The car was red' is false.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid if and only if 'The car was red' is false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, if 'The car was red' is false."
