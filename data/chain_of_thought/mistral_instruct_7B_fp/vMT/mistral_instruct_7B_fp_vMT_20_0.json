            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that starts with a conditional statement (if P then Q) and then denies the conclusion (not Q). If the argument is logically valid, then denying the conclusion (not Q) must also imply that the premise (P) is false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. The second premise is 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if denying the conclusion (not Q) implies that the first premise (P) is false. In this case, the conclusion is 'The apple was not red'. Denying this conclusion means that the apple was red.\n\nIf the apple was red, then according to the first premise, the banana was yellow. But we know from the second premise that the banana was not yellow. This is a contradiction, which means that denying the conclusion (the apple was red) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
