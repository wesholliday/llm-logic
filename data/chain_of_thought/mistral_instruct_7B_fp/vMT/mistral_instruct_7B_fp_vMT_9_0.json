            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Premise 1)\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to Premise 1, Mark should have bought the blue shirt. But Premise 2 states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have both Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark not buying the blue shirt at the same time, given Premise 1.\n\nSince we cannot find a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
