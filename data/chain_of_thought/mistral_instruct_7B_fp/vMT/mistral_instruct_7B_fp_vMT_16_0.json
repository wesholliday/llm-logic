            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (Premise 1)\n2. The pants were not denim (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (Conclusion)\n\nExplanation of Premise 1:\nThis is a conditional statement, meaning it has an 'if-then' structure. The 'if' part is 'the shirt was cotton', and the 'then' part is 'the pants were denim'.\n\nExplanation of Premise 2:\nThis statement negates the 'then' part of the conditional statement in Premise 1, meaning 'the pants were not denim'.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\nIf Premise 1 is true, then if the shirt is cotton, the pants must be denim. But Premise 2 tells us that the pants are not denim. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton, because if it were, the pants would have to be denim, but they're not.\n\nSo, if the premises are true, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
