            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a contrapositive argument. In a contrapositive argument, if the original conditional statement is 'If P then Q', then the contrapositive is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. The contrapositive would be 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nHowever, the second premise of the argument is 'Chris did not finish the race', which matches the contrapositive statement. The conclusion of the argument is 'Alex did not finish the race', which also matches the conclusion of the contrapositive argument.\n\nTherefore, if the argument is logically valid, it should follow that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true, making this form of argument logically valid."
