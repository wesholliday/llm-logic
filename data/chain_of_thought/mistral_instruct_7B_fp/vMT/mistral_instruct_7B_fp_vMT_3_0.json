In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\n2. The book is not a mystery novel (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book was not written by James (Conclusion)\n\nTo test for logical validity, we can use a technique called reductio ad absurdum, which involves assuming the opposite of the conclusion and seeing if that leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's assume the opposite of the conclusion:\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\n2. The book is not a mystery novel (Premise 2)\n3. But, let's assume the book was written by James (opposite of the conclusion)\n\nFrom Premise 1 and our assumption, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel. However, this contradicts Premise 2, which states that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, our assumption that the book was written by James leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nSince it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
