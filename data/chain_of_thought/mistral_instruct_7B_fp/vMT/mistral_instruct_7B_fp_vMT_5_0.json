            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a contrapositive argument. In a contrapositive argument, if the original conditional statement is 'If P then Q', the contrapositive statement is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. The contrapositive statement would be 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nHowever, the second premise of the argument is 'Amy did not play tennis', which is consistent with the contrapositive statement. Therefore, if the argument were valid, the conclusion 'Jeff did not play basketball' would follow logically from the premises.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The argument assumes that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff must not have played basketball. But this is not necessarily true. It is possible that Jeff played basketball, but Amy did not play tennis for some other reason. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
