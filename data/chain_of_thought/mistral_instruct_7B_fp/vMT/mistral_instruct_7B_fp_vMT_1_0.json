            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Premise 1)\n2. Sue was not at the wedding (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nExplanation of Premise 1: This premise is stating a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding. If the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nExplanation of Premise 2: This premise is stating that the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is false.\n\nNow, let's see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises:\n\nIf we were to assume that Mary was at the wedding (contradicting the conclusion), then according to Premise 1, Sue would also have to be at the wedding. But Premise 2 states that Sue was not at the wedding, which is a contradiction.\n\nSince denying the conclusion leads to a contradiction with the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
