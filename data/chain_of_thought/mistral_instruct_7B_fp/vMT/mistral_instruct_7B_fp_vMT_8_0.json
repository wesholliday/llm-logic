            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (P1)\n2. The mummy was not awake (P2)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake (C)\n\nTo check if this argument is valid, we can use a technique called reductio ad absurdum, which means we assume the opposite of the conclusion and see if it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the opposite of the conclusion, we would have:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (P1)\n2. The mummy was awake (not P2)\n\nFrom P1, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. But we assumed that the mummy is awake, so the vampire must also be awake (according to P1).\n\nHowever, this contradicts our second premise (P2), which states that the mummy was not awake. Therefore, our assumption that the vampire is awake leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince our assumption that the vampire is awake leads to a contradiction, it means that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
