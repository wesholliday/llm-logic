In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (Premise 1)\n2. The cat was not outside. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the dog was not inside. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If the dog was inside and the cat was outside, then the conclusion 'The dog was not inside' would be false. However, since Premise 2 states that 'The cat was not outside', this scenario is not possible. Therefore, the argument is not valid because its conclusion does not follow logically from its premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
