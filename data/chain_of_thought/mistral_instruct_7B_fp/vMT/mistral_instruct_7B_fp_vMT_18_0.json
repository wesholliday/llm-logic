            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n2. The truck was not metal. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the doll was not plastic. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If the doll was plastic, then according to the first premise, the truck must be metal. But the second premise states that the truck is not metal. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'the truck is metal' and 'the truck is not metal' be true at the same time.\n\nSince there is no scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
