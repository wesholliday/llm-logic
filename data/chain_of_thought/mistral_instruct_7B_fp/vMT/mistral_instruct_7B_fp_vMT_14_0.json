            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional argument, specifically a contrapositive argument. In a contrapositive argument, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the original conditional statement, and the negation of the original premise.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nThe argument given to us is:\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was not in the den.\n3. Therefore, the bear was not in the cave.\n\nComparing this argument to the contrapositive statement, we can see that the conclusion of the argument matches the consequent of the contrapositive statement.\n\nHowever, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises logically imply the conclusion. In other words, we need to check if it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise is its contrapositive. Since the second premise is true, the first premise must be false. This means that it is not possible for the bear to be in the cave and the wolf to be in the den. Therefore, if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave, which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
