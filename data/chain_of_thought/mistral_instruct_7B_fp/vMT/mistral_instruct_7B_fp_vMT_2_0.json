            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (Premise 1)\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If the griffin was not in the forest (which is what Premise 2 states), then it should not matter if Premise 1 is true or false, because the griffin is not there to have any effect on the unicorn being in the forest. However, if Premise 1 is true, then the unicorn should be in the forest, but Premise 2 states that the unicorn is not there. This is a contradiction, and we cannot have both Premise 1 and Premise 2 be true at the same time.\n\nSince it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
