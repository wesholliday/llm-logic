            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (P1)\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter (P2)\n3. Therefore, the alien did not visit Mars (C)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (P1) and its contradiction (P2 and not-C). To check if the argument is valid, we can use the method of reductio ad absurdum, which involves assuming the opposite of the conclusion and showing that it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the opposite of the conclusion, we have:\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (P1)\n2. The robot visited Jupiter (not P2)\n\nFrom P1 and not-P2, we can infer that the alien visited Mars (C). However, this contradicts P2, which states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Therefore, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
