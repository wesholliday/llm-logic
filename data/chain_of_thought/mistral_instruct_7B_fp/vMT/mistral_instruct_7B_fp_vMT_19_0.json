            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Premise 1)\n2. Jen did not watch basketball. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football. (Conclusion)\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If such a scenario exists, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nHowever, it is not possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion false. If Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball (according to Premise 1). But Premise 2 states that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, Tom cannot have watched football.\n\nSo, there is no possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
