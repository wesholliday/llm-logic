In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Premise 1)\n2. Erin did not take a train. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If this scenario is impossible, then the argument is valid.\n\nScenario:\n- Sam took a plane. (This makes Premise 1 true.)\n- Erin did not take a train. (This makes Premise 2 true.)\n- But, in this scenario, Sam did take a plane, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
