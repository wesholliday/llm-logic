            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. (Premise 1)\n2. The muffins were not blueberry. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false, i.e., the cake was chocolate. If this is the case, then according to Premise 1, the muffins should be blueberry. But Premise 2 states that the muffins were not blueberry. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'the cake was chocolate' and 'the muffins were not blueberry' be true at the same time, given Premise 1.\n\nSince denying the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
