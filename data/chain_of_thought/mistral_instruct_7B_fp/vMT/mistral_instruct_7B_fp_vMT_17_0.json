In this case, P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate salad'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nIf 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is true, and 'Kate did not eat salad' is also true, then it must be the case that 'Ben did not eat pasta' is true as well. This is because if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have had to eat salad, but since Kate did not eat salad, it follows that Ben could not have eaten pasta.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
