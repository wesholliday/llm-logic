In this case, the original statement 'The plonk must be flimble zibber' does not provide enough information to infer 'The plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber'. The original statement only specifies that 'The plonk must be flimble zibber', but it does not suggest that 'quimble flonk' is an alternative or equivalent to 'flimble zibber'. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
