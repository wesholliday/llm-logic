It suggests that 'fizzle' should be associated with 'zazzle' and 'gronk', but it does not specify where or how.\n\nTo infer 'The fizzle must be on an quank gribble or zazzle with gronk', we would need additional context or information to make that connection. The phrase 'on an quank gribble' is not related to the given sentence and seems to be an additional requirement that was not provided. Therefore, we cannot infer this statement based on the given sentence.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
