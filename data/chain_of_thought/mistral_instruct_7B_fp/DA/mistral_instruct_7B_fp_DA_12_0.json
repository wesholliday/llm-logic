            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Joe did not go to the park'. This means that Joe did not fulfill the condition in the first statement.\n\nHowever, the absence of Joe going to the park does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. The conditional statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. It does not say that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
