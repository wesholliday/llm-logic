            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement. It means that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. The second statement 'Sam did not take a plane' tells us that Sam did not fulfill the condition in the first statement.\n\nHowever, the absence of Sam taking a plane does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train. The conditional statement only tells us that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. It does not say that if Sam does not take a plane, then Erin does not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Erin did not take a train' based on 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
