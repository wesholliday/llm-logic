The second statement given is 'Sue did not choose pizza'. This means that Sue did not select pizza as her choice.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. Since the first statement says that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta, and we know that Sue did not choose pizza, it follows that the condition for Bob to choose pasta is not met. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that Bob chose pasta. However, we cannot say for sure that Bob did choose pizza either, as the statement only says that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta, not that Bob chooses pasta if Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
