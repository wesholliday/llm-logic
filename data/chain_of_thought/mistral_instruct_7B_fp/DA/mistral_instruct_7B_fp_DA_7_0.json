It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. The second statement 'Alex did not finished the race' means that Alex did not meet the condition in the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, it does not necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the race. It only means that if Alex finished, then Chris also finished. But since Alex did not finish, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Chris did not finish the race' based on 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' and 'Alex did not finished the race'."
