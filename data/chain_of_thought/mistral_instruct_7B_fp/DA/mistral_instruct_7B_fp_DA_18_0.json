            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given premises are 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nTo infer whether the truck is not metal, we need to consider the conditional statement given. A conditional statement has two parts: the 'if' part (the hypothesis) and the 'then' part (the conclusion). In this case, the hypothesis is 'the doll is plastic' and the conclusion is 'the truck is metal'.\n\nSince the second premise states 'The doll was not plastic', this means that the doll does not fit the condition in the first premise. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. The first premise only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. It does not say that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not metal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The truck was not metal'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
