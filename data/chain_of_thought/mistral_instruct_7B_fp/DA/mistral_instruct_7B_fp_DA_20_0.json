This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the second statement given is 'The apple was not red'. This means that the apple was not red, and therefore, according to the conditional statement, the banana should not be yellow either.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on the given statements, we can infer that the banana was not yellow."
