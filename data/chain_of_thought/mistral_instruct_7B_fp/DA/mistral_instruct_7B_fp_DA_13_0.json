            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The car was not red'. This means that the car is not red, and since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot automatically assume that the second part (the truck being blue) is true. However, we cannot infer that the truck is blue either, because the conditional statement only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. It does not say that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue. Therefore, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the color of the truck based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue'. The given information does not allow us to make that conclusion."
