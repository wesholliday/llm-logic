However, if the condition is false, the consequence does not necessarily have to be false. In this case, the condition is 'The bear was in the cave', and it is stated as false in the second premise.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot automatically conclude that the consequence is also false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wolf was not in the den' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
