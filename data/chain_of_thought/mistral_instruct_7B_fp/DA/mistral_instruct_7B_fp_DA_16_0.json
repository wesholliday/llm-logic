The first premise states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n2. The second premise states that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the two premises:\n1. Since the second premise states that the shirt is not cotton, it means that the condition in the first premise (if the shirt is cotton) does not hold true.\n2. However, the first premise does not provide any information about the pants if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nSince the first premise does not provide any information about the pants when the shirt is not cotton, we cannot infer 'The pants were not denim' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
