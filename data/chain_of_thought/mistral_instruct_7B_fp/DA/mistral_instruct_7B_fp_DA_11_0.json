            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The second statement 'The cake was not chocolate' negates the condition in the first statement. Since the cake is not chocolate, the condition in the first statement does not hold true. However, the negation of the condition does not necessarily mean that the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) is also not true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The muffins were not blueberry' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
