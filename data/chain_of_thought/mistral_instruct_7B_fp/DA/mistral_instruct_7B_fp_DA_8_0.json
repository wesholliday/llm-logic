            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. It means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. The second statement 'The vampire was not awake' is a fact that the vampire was in a state of not being awake.\n\nTo infer whether the mummy was awake or not, we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, it means that if the condition (vampire being awake) is not met, then the consequence (mummy being awake) also does not occur. In this case, the condition is not met (vampire is not awake), so we can infer that the consequence (mummy being awake) also does not occur.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
