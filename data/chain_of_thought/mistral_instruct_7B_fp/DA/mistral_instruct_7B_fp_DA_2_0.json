The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTo infer whether the unicorn was not in the forest, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, the second premise states that the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nSince the griffin is not in the forest, according to the first premise, the unicorn should not be in the forest either. Therefore, it seems that we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
