            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This means that whenever Tom watches football, Jen also watches basketball. The second statement is 'Tom did not watch football'. This means that Tom did not fulfill the condition for the 'if' statement to be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that Jen also did not watch basketball. The 'if' statement only tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. It does not say that if Tom does not watch football, then Jen does not watch basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
