This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy played tennis) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Jeff did not play basketball'. This means that Jeff's playing basketball is false.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not allow us to infer that Amy did not play tennis. The conditional statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not say that if Jeff does not play basketball, then Amy does not play tennis. Therefore, we cannot make such an inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
