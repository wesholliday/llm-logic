The first premise tells us that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. The second premise tells us that the dog is not inside.\n\nSince the dog is not inside, according to the first premise, the cat must be outside. However, the information given does not tell us whether the cat is actually outside or not. It only tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, but the dog is not inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The cat was not outside' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
