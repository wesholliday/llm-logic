            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. The second statement 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' tells us that Lisa did not fulfill the condition in the first statement.\n\nNow, let's think about the conclusion 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then according to the first statement, Mark should not have bought the blue shirt either. However, the statement does not say that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'."
