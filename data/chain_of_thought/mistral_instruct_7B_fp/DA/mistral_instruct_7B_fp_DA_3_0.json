            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The book was not written by James'. This statement negates the condition in the first statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the negation of the condition also negates the consequence. In other words, if the book was not written by James, does that mean the book is not a mystery novel?\n\nTo answer this, we can use the concept of logical implication. If the book was not written by James, then the book cannot be a mystery novel according to the first statement. This is because the condition (the book was written by James) is not met, so the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
