            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This means that if Mary is present at the wedding, then Sue is also present. The second statement given is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. This means that Mary is not present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement tells us that if Mary is present, then Sue is also present. However, the second statement tells us that Mary is not present. Since the first statement only tells us that Sue is present if Mary is, and we know that Mary is not present, we cannot infer that Sue is also not present.\n\nHowever, the statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that if Mary is not present, then Sue is also not present. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' based on the given information."
