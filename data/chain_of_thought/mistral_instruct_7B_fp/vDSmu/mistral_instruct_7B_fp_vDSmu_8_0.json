Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The remote control is on the coffee table' and Q is 'The remote control must be hiding under the couch'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nGiven the premises, 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' and 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch', we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table. This is because if it were not on the coffee table, then it would have to be hiding under the couch, but we know that it cannot be hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
