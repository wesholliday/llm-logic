Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The pen is in my bag' and Q is 'The pen must be on my desk'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nGiven the first premise 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk', and the second premise 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk', we can infer that the pen must be in my bag. This is because the only other option, 'The pen must be on my desk', has been ruled out by the second premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
