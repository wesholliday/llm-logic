Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The keys are in the drawer' and Q is 'The keys must be dangling in the cabinet'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Since the argument is in the form of disjunctive syllogism, we know that if the second premise 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' is true, then the first premise 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' must be true, and its negation 'The keys are not in the drawer' must be false. Therefore, the only remaining option is that 'The keys are in the drawer' is true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
