Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Fido is inside' and Q is 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, given that the argument is a valid form of logical argument (disjunctive syllogism), and if the first premise 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' is true, and the second premise 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' is also true, then the conclusion 'Fido is inside' logically follows. However, it's important to note that the truth of the premises is not given in this case, and the argument could be invalid if the premises are not true."
