Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack' and Q is 'The scarf must be draped on the coat rack'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, given that the argument is a valid form of disjunctive syllogism, and if the first premise is true (either the scarf is in the backpack or it's on the coat rack), and the second premise is also true (it's not the case that the scarf must be on the coat rack), then the conclusion must be true (the scarf is in the backpack). However, the validity of the argument does not guarantee the truth of its premises or conclusion. The truth of the premises and conclusion depends on the actual state of the world."
