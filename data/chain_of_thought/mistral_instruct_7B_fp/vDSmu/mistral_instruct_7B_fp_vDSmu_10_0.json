A disjunctive syllogism has the following structure:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the disjunction is 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed'. The first premise asserts this disjunction. The second premise, 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed', is equivalent to 'Not (The missing sock must be under the bed)', which is the negation of one of the disjuncts.\n\nThe conclusion, 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket', is the other disjunct. Since the argument follows the structure of a valid disjunctive syllogism and all of its premises are true, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
