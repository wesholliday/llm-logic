Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box', and Q is 'The missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nGiven the premises, if it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor (premise 2), then it must be the case that the missing puzzle piece is in the box (premise 1). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
