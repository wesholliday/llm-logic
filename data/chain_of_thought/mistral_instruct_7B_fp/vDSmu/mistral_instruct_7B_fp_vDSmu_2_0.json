Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The book is on the shelf' and Q is 'The book must be resting on the table'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we need to consider the truth of the premises and the conclusion. Since we are not given any information about the actual state of the book, we cannot determine the truth or falsity of the premises or the conclusion. However, we can determine if the argument is logically valid based on its structure.\n\nSince disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid in form, but we cannot determine if it is logically valid in fact without knowing the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid in form, but we cannot determine if it is logically valid in fact without knowing the truth values of the premises and the conclusion."
