Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The toy is in the toy box' and Q is 'The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Since the argument is in the form of disjunctive syllogism, we can see that if the second premise 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' is true, then the first premise 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' implies that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
