P or Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' (P or Q), the second premise is 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet' (not P), and the conclusion is 'The jacket is draped over the chair' (Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of disjunctive syllogism and the second premise negates the first disjunct, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
