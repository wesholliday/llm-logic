A disjunctive syllogism has the following structure:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the disjunction is 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head'. The first premise asserts this disjunction. The second premise asserts 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', which is equivalent to 'Not (sunglasses are not in her bag and sunglasses are perched on her head)', or 'The sunglasses are not perched on her head and they are in her bag is false'.\n\nSince the second premise is false, it means that 'The sunglasses are not perched on her head and they are in her bag' is not the case. This means that 'The sunglasses are not perched on her head' is false, which means that 'The sunglasses are in her bag' is true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
