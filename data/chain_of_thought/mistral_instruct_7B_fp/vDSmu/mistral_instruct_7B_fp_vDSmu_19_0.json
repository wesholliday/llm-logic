A disjunctive syllogism has the following structure:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' (P or Q), the second premise is 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist' (Not P), and the conclusion is 'The watch is charging on the dresser' (Q).\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, since the argument is a disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid as long as the premises are true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid. However, whether the conclusion is actually true depends on the truth of the premises. If the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, and it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist, then the watch must be charging on the dresser. But whether the watch is actually charging on the dresser is a factual matter that cannot be determined from the argument itself."
