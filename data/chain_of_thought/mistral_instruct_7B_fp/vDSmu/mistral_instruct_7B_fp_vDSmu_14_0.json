Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The milk is on the counter' and Q is 'It must be chilling in the fridge'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, given that the argument is a valid form of disjunctive syllogism, and the second premise 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' implies that 'The milk is not chilling in the fridge', and since the first premise 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' states that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter, the conclusion 'The milk is on the counter' logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid."
