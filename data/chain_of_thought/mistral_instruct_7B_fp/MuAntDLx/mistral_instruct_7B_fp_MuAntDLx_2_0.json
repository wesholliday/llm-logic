This means that either 'The flump must be on the plonk' or 'The flump must be in the glorp' must be true. However, the sentence does not necessarily mean that 'The flump must be on the plonk' is the only possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flump must be on the plonk' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
