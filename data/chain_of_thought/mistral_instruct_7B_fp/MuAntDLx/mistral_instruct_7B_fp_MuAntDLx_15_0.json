In this case, 'zooble frazzle wump' and 'snork' are the alternatives. If we are trying to infer that the blimp must be 'zooble frazzle wump' based on this statement, we would need to have information that rules out the other alternative, 'snork'. Without such information, we cannot infer that the blimp must be 'zooble frazzle wump' based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
