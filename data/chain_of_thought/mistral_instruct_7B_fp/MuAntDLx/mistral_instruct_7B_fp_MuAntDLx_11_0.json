However, this statement does not exclude the possibility that the flonk is a grooble. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say 'The flonk must be grooble', we also cannot infer that it must be a flim. The statement only provides us with two possible options, but it does not specify which one is the correct one.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flonk must be grooble' based on the given statement."
