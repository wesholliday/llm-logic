This means that 'The glorp' must either be 'wozzle frazzle' or 'blurble'. However, it does not necessarily mean that 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle'. The sentence only implies that 'The glorp' cannot be 'blurble' if it is not 'wozzle frazzle'.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle' from the given sentence."
