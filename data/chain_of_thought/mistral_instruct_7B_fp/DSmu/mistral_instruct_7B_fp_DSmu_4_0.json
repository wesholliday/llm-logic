The second statement 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom. Since the disjunction states that at least one of the conditions must be true, and we know that the second condition is not true, then the first condition must be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
