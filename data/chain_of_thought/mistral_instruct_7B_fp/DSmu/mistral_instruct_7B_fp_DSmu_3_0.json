            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' is a disjunction, meaning it states that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet. Since a disjunction is true if at least one of its parts is true, and we know that the second part is not true, the only remaining possibility is that the first part is true, meaning the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
