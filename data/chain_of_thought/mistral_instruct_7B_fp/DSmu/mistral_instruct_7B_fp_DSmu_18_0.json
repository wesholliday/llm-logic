            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' is a disjunction, meaning it states that the notebook can be in one of two places: the drawer or the nightstand. The second statement 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand. However, it does not negate the first part of the disjunction, meaning the notebook could still be in the drawer. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The notebook is in the drawer' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
