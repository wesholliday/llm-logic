The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that Fido is not required to be in the garden, but it does not necessarily mean that he is inside the house.\n\nSince the statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' does not provide enough information to conclude that Fido is inside the house, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
