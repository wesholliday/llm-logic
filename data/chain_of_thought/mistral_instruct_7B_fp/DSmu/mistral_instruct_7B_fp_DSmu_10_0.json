The statement 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed' means that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed, but it could still be in the laundry basket.\n\nSince the statement 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed' does not exclude the possibility that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, we cannot infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
