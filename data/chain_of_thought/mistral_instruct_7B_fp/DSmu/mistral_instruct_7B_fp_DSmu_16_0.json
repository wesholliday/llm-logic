The statement 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk' means that the pen is not necessarily on the desk, but it could still be in the bag.\nSince the pen cannot be on the desk and it cannot be neither on the desk nor in the bag, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the bag.\nAnswer:\nYes."
