            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that if Q is not true, then P must also be not true.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not provide enough information to infer the reverse conditional statement 'If Q is not true, then P is not true'. This is because the original statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. It does not tell us anything about what happens if the truck is not metal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
