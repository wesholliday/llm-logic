This type of statement implies that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is not true, then P must be false.\n\nIn this case, the statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' does not provide enough information to infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. This is because there could be other reasons why the book is not a mystery novel, such as it being written by someone else or being a different genre altogether.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The given information does not allow us to make this inference."
