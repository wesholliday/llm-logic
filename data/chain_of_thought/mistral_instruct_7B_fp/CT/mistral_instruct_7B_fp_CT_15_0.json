This statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then another event (Erin taking a train) also occurs. However, it does not imply that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. This is because the given statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane' based on the given statement."
