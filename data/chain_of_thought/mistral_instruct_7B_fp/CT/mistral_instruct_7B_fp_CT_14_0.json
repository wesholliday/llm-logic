            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. This type of statement implies that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn other words, the given statement does not provide enough information to infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. This is because the original statement only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. It does not tell us anything about what happens if the wolf is not in the den.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' based on the given statement."
