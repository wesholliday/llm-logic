            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the inverse of this statement, 'If Q, then P', is not necessarily true. This means that if Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nNow, to form the statement 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding', we are trying to find the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the statement 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' is the contrapositive of the original statement. However, to determine if this statement is true or false, we need to check if its contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following logic:\n\n1. If Sue was not at the wedding (not Q), then Mary was not at the wedding (not P)\n2. If not Q, then not P is true if and only if P implies Q\n\nSince we know that 'If P, then Q' is not logically equivalent to 'If Q, then P', it follows that 'If not Q, then not P' is also not logically equivalent to 'If P, then Q'. Therefore, the statement 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
