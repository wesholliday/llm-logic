This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it follows that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not imply that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the original statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The given statement does not allow us to infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'."
