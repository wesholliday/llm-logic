This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse of the given statement: 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. It is possible that Joe went to the park even if Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'."
