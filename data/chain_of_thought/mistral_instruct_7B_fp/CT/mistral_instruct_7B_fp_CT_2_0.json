The given statement only tells us that the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn, not that the absence of the unicorn implies the absence of the griffin. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
