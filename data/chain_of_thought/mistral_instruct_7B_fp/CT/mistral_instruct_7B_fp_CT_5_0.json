            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball. It only means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. This statement is also a conditional statement, but it is the opposite of the first statement. It means that if the first part (Amy did not play tennis) is true, then the second part (Jeff did not play basketball) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer this statement from the given statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. The reason is that the given statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. The given statement only tells us that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis. It does not tell us anything about what happens if Amy does not play tennis. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'."
