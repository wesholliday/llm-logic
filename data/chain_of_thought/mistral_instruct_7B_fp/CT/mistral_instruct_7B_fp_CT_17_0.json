This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate the salad) must also be true. However, the statement does not provide any information about the situation if Kate did not eat the salad. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
