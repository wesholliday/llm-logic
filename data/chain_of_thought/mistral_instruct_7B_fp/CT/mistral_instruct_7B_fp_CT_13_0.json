This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, the statement does not provide any information about what happens if the truck is not blue. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
