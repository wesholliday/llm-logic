The second statement 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled' gives us two possibilities: either the zinger must be smoogled, or it is fraggled. Since we know that the zinger is not required to be smoogled, the only remaining option is that 'it is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The zinger is fraggled' directly from the given statements. However, as explained above, given that 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled', the second statement 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled' logically implies that 'The zinger is fraggled'."
