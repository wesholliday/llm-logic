The second statement 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged' means that there are only two possibilities: either the glip must be tragged, or the glip is slogged.\n\nSince we know that it is not necessary for the glip to be tragged, the first possibility (the glip must be tragged) cannot be true. Therefore, the second possibility must be true, which means 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
