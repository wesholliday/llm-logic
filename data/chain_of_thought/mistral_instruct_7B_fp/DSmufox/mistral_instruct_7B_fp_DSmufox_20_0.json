The second statement 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered' means that either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered, and neither can be false.\n\nIf the first statement is true, then the fleeg does not have to be surned. However, the second statement also states that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. Since the first statement is true, the fleeg does not have to be surned, and therefore, according to the second statement, it must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
