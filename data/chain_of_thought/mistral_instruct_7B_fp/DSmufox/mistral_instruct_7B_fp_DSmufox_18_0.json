The second statement 'Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked' means that there are only two possibilities for the shank: it must be nugged or it is plooked. Since we know that the shank is not required to be nugged, the only remaining possibility is that 'it is plooked'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
