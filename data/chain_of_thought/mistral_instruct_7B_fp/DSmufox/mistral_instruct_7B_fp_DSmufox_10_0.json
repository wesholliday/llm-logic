It does not have to be garpled.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning it can be read as 'The wug must be garpled' OR 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nSince we know that the wug is not necessarily garpled from the first statement, it means that the wug must be sproinged, as per the second statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
