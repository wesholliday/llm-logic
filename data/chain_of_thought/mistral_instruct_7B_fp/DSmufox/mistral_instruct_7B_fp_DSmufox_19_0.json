The second statement 'Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled' means that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled, and neither condition can be false.\n\nSince we know that the smonk is not necessarily plagged, it follows that the smonk must be vreebled, because if it were plagged, then the first statement would be false, and the second statement states that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled, which cannot both be false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
