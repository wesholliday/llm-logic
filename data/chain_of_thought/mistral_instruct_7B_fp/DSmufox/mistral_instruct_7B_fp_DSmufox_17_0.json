The second statement 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, the statement does not specify that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
