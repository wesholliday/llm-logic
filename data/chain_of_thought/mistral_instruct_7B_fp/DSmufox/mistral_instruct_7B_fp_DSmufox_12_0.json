The second statement 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped' means that there are only two possibilities: either the smip must be lupped, or the smip is shripped. Since we know that the smip is not obligated to be lupped, the only remaining possibility is that 'The smip is shripped'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
