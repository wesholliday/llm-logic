The second statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. In this case, the conditions are 'the splat must be quanked' and 'it is morphed'.\n\nSince we know that the splat does not have to be quanked (from the first statement), this means that the first condition in the disjunction is false. Therefore, the second condition must be true, which means that 'it is morphed' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
