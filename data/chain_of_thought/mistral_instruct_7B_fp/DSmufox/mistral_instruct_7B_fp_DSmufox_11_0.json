The second statement 'Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed' means that there are only two possibilities for the flug: either it must be zimmed or it is blummed. Since we know that the flug is not required to be zimmed, the only other possibility is that it is blummed.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
