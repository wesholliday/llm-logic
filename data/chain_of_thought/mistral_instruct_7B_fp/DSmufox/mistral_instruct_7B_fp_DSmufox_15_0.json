The second premise is a disjunction, which means it can be broken down into two parts: 'The dreb must be spent' or 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nSince we know that the dreb does not have to be spent (from the first premise), the first part of the disjunction cannot be true. Therefore, the second part must be true: 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
