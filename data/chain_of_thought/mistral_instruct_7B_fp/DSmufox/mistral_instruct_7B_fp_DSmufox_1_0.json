This statement does not rule out the possibility that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, the 'or' in this statement is inclusive, meaning that both conditions could be true.\n\nSince we cannot infer from the first statement that the flugel is blimmed, and the second statement does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the flugel is blimmed, we cannot infer 'The flugel is blimmed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
