The second statement 'Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished' means that there are only two possibilities for the twonk: it must be plinked or it is varnished. Since we know that the twonk does not have to be plinked, the only remaining possibility is that it is varnished.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
