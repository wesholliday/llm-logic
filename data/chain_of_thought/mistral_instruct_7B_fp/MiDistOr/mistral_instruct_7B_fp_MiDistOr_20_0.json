Therefore, it is not necessary to rephrase it as 'The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal' because the meaning is already conveyed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal' from 'The event might be formal or semi-formal'. The original statement already includes the possibility of the event being either formal or semi-formal, so there is no need to add 'or it might be' to the statement."
