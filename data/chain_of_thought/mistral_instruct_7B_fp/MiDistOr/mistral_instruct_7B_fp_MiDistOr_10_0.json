However, the phrase does not exclude the possibility that the document is only signed, without being notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The document might be signed or it might be notarized' from the given information, as this statement implies that the document could be in one of two states: either it is signed, or it is not signed.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
