Therefore, the phrase 'The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow' is redundant and conveys the same information as the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer 'The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow' from 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow'. However, it is not necessary to make this inference as the original statement already implies the same meaning."
