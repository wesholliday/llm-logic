However, the phrase 'might be' is used in both options, indicating that there is some degree of uncertainty or possibility. Therefore, it is logically consistent to rephrase the statement as 'The medicine might be taken with food or it might be taken on an empty stomach', as both options are already included in the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
