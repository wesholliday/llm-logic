Therefore, it is not necessary to rephrase it as 'The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table', as this statement is logically equivalent to the original one.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table' from 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table'. Both statements mean the same thing."
