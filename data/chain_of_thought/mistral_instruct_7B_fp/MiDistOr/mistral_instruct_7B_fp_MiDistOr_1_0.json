Therefore, it is not necessary to rephrase it as 'The envelope might be upstairs or it might be under a bed', as this statement is logically equivalent to the original.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The envelope might be upstairs or it might be under a bed' from 'The envelope might be upstairs or under a bed'. Both statements mean the same thing."
