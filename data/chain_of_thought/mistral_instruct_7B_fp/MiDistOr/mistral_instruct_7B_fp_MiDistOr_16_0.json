Therefore, it is not necessary to separate the two possibilities into 'The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request' as both possibilities are already included in the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request' from 'The room might be cleaned daily or upon request'. The original statement already covers both possibilities."
