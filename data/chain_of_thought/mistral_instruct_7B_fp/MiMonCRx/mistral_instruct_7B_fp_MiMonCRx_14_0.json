'Blimped' and 'zazzled' are presumably adjectives or actions that can be applied to the grazzle.\n\nTo infer 'The grazzle might be zazzled' from the original statement, we need to determine if 'zazzled' is one of the potential states or events that the grazzle could experience, given that 'might be blimped and zazzled' is mentioned. Since 'zazzled' is explicitly mentioned in the original statement, it can be inferred that 'The grazzle might be zazzled' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
