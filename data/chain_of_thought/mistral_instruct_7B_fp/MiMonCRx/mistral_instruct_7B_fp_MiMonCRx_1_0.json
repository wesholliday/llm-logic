The first event is 'zorping', and the second event is 'gribbling'. 'Zorping' and 'gribbling' are not defined in the context, so we cannot assume that 'gribbling' is a more severe or less severe event than 'zorping'. Therefore, if the flibbit might be 'zorped', it also might be 'gribbled'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
