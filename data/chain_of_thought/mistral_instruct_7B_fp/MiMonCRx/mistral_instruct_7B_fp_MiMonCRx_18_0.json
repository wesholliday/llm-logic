The phrase 'and' indicates that both actions are possible.\n\nIn the second sentence, 'The wibble might be zazzled', we are only considering the possibility of 'zazzling' 'The wibble'.\n\nHowever, since 'The wibble might be plonked and zazzled' already includes the possibility of 'zazzling', we cannot infer anything new from 'The wibble might be zazzled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wibble might be zazzled' from 'The wibble might be plonked and zazzled'. The second sentence does not provide any additional information."
