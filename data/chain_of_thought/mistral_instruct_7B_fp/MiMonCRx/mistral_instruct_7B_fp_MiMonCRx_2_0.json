            "content": "Explanation:\nIn the phrase 'The quibble might be snorked and wumbled', 'and wumbled' is an additional action that can be taken on 'The quibble' after 'The quibble might be snorked'. This suggests that 'wumbled' is a possible action that can be performed on 'The quibble' on its own, without the need for 'snorking' first. Therefore, it is possible to infer 'The quibble might be wumbled' from the original phrase.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
