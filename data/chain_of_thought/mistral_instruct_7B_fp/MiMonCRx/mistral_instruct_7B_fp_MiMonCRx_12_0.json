'Frobbed' and 'quorked' are likely actions or events that can happen to the zibble, but the exact meaning of these words is not provided in the context.\n\nGiven that 'quorked' is one of the possible actions that could be taken on the zibble, it is logically possible that 'The zibble might be quorked' is true. Therefore, we cannot definitively say 'yes' or 'no' based on the information provided, but we can infer that it is a possible outcome.\n\nAnswer:\nIt is not possible to definitively say 'yes' or 'no' based on the information provided, but we can infer that 'The zibble might be quorked' is a possible outcome."
