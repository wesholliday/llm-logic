            "content": "Explanation:\nThe phrase 'The blimple might be snorked and frobbed' suggests that there are two possible actions that could be performed on 'The blimple'. 'Snorked' and 'frobbed' are both verbs, but their meanings are not provided in the context. However, the phrase 'and' indicates that both actions are possible.\n\nIf we want to infer whether 'The blimple might be frobbed' is true based on the given information, we need to consider the structure of the original phrase. Since 'and' is used to connect two actions, and both actions are possible, it follows that each action is also possible on its own. Therefore, 'The blimple might be frobbed' is a valid inference from 'The blimple might be snorked and frobbed'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
