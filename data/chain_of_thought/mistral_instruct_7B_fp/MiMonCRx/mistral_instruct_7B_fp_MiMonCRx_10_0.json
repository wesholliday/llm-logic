The 'and' connects these two actions, suggesting that both are possibilities.\n\nIn the second sentence, 'The blurble might be wumped', we are only considering one potential action, 'wumped', for 'The blurble'.\n\nHowever, since 'wumped' is also included in the first sentence, it is a valid inference that 'The blurble might be wumped'. This is because 'wumped' is a possibility that is already established in the first sentence.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
