            "content": "Explanation:\nThe phrase 'The froodle might be quimbled and wozzled' suggests that the froodle could be in a state of being both quimbled and wozzled. 'Quimbled' and 'wozzled' are likely to be adjectives or past participles describing a state or condition of the froodle. If 'quimbled' and 'wozzled' are separate states, then it is possible that 'The froodle might be wozzled' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
