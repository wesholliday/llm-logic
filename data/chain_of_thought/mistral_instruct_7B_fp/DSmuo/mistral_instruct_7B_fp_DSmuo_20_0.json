The second statement 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' means that the sunglasses are either in her bag or they must be perched on her head, with no other options given.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head, and the second statement does not provide any other option for the sunglasses to be, it follows that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
