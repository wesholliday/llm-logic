It could be somewhere else.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' means that the notebook can be either in the drawer or it must be on the nightstand. This statement implies that if the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand, and the second statement tells us that if it's not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
