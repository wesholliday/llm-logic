It could be somewhere else, such as in your bag.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' is a disjunction, meaning it states that either one or the other condition must be true. In this case, it means either the pen is in your bag or it must be on your desk.\n\nGiven that we know from the first statement that the pen is not necessarily on your desk, and the second statement tells us that if it's not in your bag, then it must be on your desk, we can infer that the pen must be in your bag, because if it were on your desk, the first statement would not be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
