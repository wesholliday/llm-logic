The second statement 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed' means that the missing sock can either be in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed (but it's not necessarily under the bed).\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed, and the second statement also tells us that it's not necessarily under the bed, it means that the missing sock could be in the laundry basket. However, the second statement also leaves open the possibility that the missing sock is under the bed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
