The second statement 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch' means that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch, with no other options given.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch, and the second statement tells us that it must be either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on this information alone. The second statement does not rule out the possibility that the remote control is hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
