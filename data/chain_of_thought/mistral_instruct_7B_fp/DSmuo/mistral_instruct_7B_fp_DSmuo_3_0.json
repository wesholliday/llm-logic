The second statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet' means that the keys can either be in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet (which we know is not the case). However, the second statement also implies that if the keys are not in the cabinet dangling, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nSo, from these two statements, we can infer that 'The keys are in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
