The second statement 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' means that the watch can either be charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Since the watch is not necessarily on his wrist (as stated in the first statement), it must be charging on the dresser (as per the second statement).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
