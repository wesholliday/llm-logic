The second statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' means that the toy can either be in the toy box or it must be on the bookshelf.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about the toy being in the toy box. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The toy is in the toy box' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
