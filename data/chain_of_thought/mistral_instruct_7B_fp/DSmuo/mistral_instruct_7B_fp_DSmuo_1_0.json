The second statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' means that Fido must either be inside or must be in the garden, but it does not specify which one is the case. Since the first statement tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, it is possible that Fido is inside. However, the given information does not provide enough evidence to definitively conclude that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based on the given information."
