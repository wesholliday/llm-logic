The second statement 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' means that the milk is either on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge, and there is no other option.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the milk is not necessarily chilling in the fridge, and the second statement tells us that if the milk is not on the counter, then it must be chilling in the fridge, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter, because if it were chilling in the fridge, the first statement would not be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
