            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement that suggests there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Mary was definitely not at the wedding. It only implies that her presence is uncertain.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' is a stronger claim that negates the necessity of Mary's presence at the wedding. This statement suggests that there is no compelling reason to believe that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nSince the first statement only implies that Mary's presence is uncertain, it does not follow logically that she was definitely not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
