However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the vampire was definitely not awake. Therefore, it is not logically valid to infer 'It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake' from 'The vampire might not have been awake'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake' from 'The vampire might not have been awake'."
