            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer. This is because the word 'might' indicates uncertainty or possibility. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that the notebook is in the drawer, and it is also not necessarily the case that the notebook is not in some other location. However, since the statement does not provide any information about the notebook's location other than it being potentially not in the drawer, we cannot infer that the notebook is definitely not in any other location either.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'. However, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that the notebook is in some other location'."
