However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the dog was definitely not inside. It only suggests that the dog's presence inside is not certain. Therefore, we cannot infer 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside' directly from 'The dog might not have been inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
