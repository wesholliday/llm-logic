However, if we want to infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair, then we can infer that it's not necessarily true that the jacket is on the chair either. This is because if the jacket might not be on the chair, then it's also not necessarily true that it must be on the chair.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
