This is not the same as saying that the watch is definitely not charging on the dresser, but it does suggest that it is not the case that the watch is definitely charging on the dresser. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer 'It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
