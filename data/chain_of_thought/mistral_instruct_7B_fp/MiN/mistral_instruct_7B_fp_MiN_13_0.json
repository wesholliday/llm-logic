            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The toy might not be in the toy box' means that there is a possibility that the toy is not inside the toy box. This statement does not necessarily mean that the toy is definitely not in the toy box, but it does imply that it is not a certainty that the toy is inside the toy box. Therefore, it is logically consistent to infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
