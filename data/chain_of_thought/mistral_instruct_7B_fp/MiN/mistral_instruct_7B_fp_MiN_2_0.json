This statement does not necessarily mean that the griffin was definitely not in the forest, but it suggests that it is not a certain fact.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest'. This inference is a logical consequence of the original statement. If it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest, then it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
