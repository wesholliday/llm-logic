This statement does not exclude the possibility that Lisa could have bought the red shirt, but it simply implies that she might not have.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt'. This statement means that it's not necessary or compulsory for Lisa to have bought the red shirt.\n\nSince the first statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' already implies that it's not necessary for Lisa to have bought the red shirt, we can infer that 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is a logical consequence of the first statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
