However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the scarf is definitely not inside the backpack. It only suggests that it's not a certainty.\n\nTo infer 'It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack', we need to consider the opposite of 'The scarf might be stuffed in my backpack'. If the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack, then it's not the case that it must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
