            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The document must have been notarized' implies that the document has gone through the process of notarization, which typically involves a notary public witnessing the signing of a document to verify the identities of the parties involved and to deter fraud. However, this phrase does not necessarily mean that the document was signed before it was notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
