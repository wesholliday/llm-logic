This could be true for various reasons, such as Chris and Alex being in the same race and finishing together, or Chris finishing after Alex.\n\nHowever, the converse statement \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\" does not necessarily follow from the first statement. This is because the first statement does not guarantee that Chris finished the race only after Alex. It only states that if Alex finished, then Chris also finished. Therefore, it is possible that Chris finished before Alex, in which case the second statement would be false.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race, based on the given information."
