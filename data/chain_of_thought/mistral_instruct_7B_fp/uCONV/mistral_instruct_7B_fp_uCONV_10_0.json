This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the dog's and cat's locations.\n\nHowever, the reverse statement \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" is not necessarily true based on the given information. This is because the original statement only establishes a relationship in one direction, not both. It does not imply that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside based on the given information."
