However, the reverse statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" does not necessarily hold true. This is because the first statement makes a causal connection between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's, but the second statement does not imply any such causal connection. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
