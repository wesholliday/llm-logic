It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, this does not mean that if the consequence is true, then the condition must also be true. In other words, just because the banana was yellow, we cannot infer that the apple was red. This is because the conditional statement only goes one way.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red."
