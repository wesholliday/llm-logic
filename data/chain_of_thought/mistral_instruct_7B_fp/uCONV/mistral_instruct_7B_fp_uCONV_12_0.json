However, they are not the inverse of each other.\n\nThe first statement is a \"if-then\" statement that implies that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo. This does not mean that if Lucy goes to the zoo, then Joe goes to the park.\n\nThe second statement is asking if we can infer the reverse of the first statement. In other words, if Lucy goes to the zoo, can we infer that Joe went to the park? The answer is no, we cannot infer that from the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
