This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"James wrote the book\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nHowever, the reverse of this statement, \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James,\" is not necessarily true. Just because a book is a mystery novel does not mean that James wrote it. There could be many authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
