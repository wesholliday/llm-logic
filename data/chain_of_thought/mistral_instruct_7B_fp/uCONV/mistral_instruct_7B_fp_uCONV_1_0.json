This is an example of a conditional statement with a forward implication.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is not necessarily true based on the information given. This is a reverse implication of the first statement, and it is not guaranteed that whenever Sue is at a wedding, Mary will also be there. We cannot infer this from the given information, as the statement does not hold true in all cases.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. We cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding based on the given information."
