Just because the truck is metal does not mean that the doll must be plastic. The statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" is not a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" is not logically followable from the given information."
