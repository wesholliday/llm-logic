This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Lisa's and Mark's actions.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement, \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt,\" does not necessarily hold true. This is because the original statement does not imply that whenever Mark buys the blue shirt, Lisa buys the red shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. The converse is not necessarily true based on the given information."
