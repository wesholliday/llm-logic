This means that the statement does not guarantee that the pen is in the bag, but it also does not rule out the possibility completely. However, to infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in the bag, we need to consider all possible scenarios. If we assume that the only two possibilities are the pen being in the bag or the pen not being in the bag, and the statement suggests that the pen might not be in the bag, then it follows that it's not the case that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
