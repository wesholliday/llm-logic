If the statement \"the sunglasses might not be in her bag\" is true, then it means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag. This possibility is enough to negate the statement \"the sunglasses must be in her bag\", which asserts that the sunglasses are definitely in her bag. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
