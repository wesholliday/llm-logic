However, this does not mean that it is a certainty or that it is the only possibility. It is possible that the dog was inside, but it is also possible that it was not. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the dog must not have been inside based on the information provided."
