However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the toy is definitely not in the toy box. It only suggests that the toy's location is uncertain and could be outside the toy box. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the toy must not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box."
