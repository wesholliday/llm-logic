In this case, we are given the information that Mary might not have been at the wedding. This means that there is some doubt or uncertainty about her presence. However, just because there is doubt or uncertainty does not mean that we can infer with certainty that she was not at the wedding. We cannot make such a strong claim based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding."
