In this case, the statement is \"The griffin might not have been in the forest.\" This statement does not necessarily mean that the griffin was in the forest, but it also does not provide enough information to conclude that the griffin was definitely not in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest."
