However, this does not mean that it is definitively true that the alien has not visited Mars. It is only suggesting that it is not certain that they have. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is the case that the alien must not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the alien must not have visited Mars."
