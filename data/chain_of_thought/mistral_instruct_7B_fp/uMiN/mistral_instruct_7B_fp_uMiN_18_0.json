This is based on the fact that the statement implies that there is some uncertainty or doubt about the notebook's location. If we cannot definitively say that the notebook is in the drawer, then it is reasonable to conclude that it is not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
