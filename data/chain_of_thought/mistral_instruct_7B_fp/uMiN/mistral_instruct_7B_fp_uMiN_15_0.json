This means that the statement does not necessarily affirm that the shoes are in the closet, but it also does not deny it. However, the absence of affirmation that the shoes are in the closet is not the same as denying that they are. To infer that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet, we would need more information or a stronger statement that explicitly denies the shoes being in the closet.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet based on the given information."
