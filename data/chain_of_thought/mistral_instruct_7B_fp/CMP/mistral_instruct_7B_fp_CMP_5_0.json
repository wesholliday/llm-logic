    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement suggests that the Democrats are likely to gain the most new voters, followed by the Republicans, with the Libertarians trailing far behind. It also states that if neither the Democrats nor the Republicans gain the most voters, then the Libertarians will. The final sentence asks if it follows that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the information given and the logical implications of that information. The statement that the Democrats are likely to gain the most voters implies that it is less likely that the Republicans will gain the most voters, and even less likely that the Libertarians will. However, the statement also says that if neither the Democrats nor the Republicans gain the most voters, then the Libertarians will.\n\nGiven this information, it is not necessarily the case that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will. While it is true that if neither the Democrats nor the Republicans gain the most voters, then the Libertarians will, it is not clear that this scenario is likely to occur. The statement that the Democrats are likely to gain the most voters suggests that it is less likely that the Republicans or Libertarians will gain the most voters. Therefore, it is more likely that either the Democrats or Republicans will gain the most voters, and the Libertarians will not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it is not likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will."
