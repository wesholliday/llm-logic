    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given suggests that spring and summer are the two most popular travel seasons, with winter being less popular. It is further stated that if neither spring nor summer has the most vacations, then winter will. However, the statement also implies that spring is more likely to have the most travelers and hence summer is less likely to. This creates a contradiction, as if spring is more likely to have the most travelers, then it is less likely that neither spring nor summer will have the most vacations. Therefore, based on the given information, it does not follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.\n\nAnswer: No."
