    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

It also mentions that if Priya doesn't get the offer, then Diego will. However, it also implies that it's likely Priya will get the offer, and hence Julian won't.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If it's likely that Priya will get the offer and hence Julian won't, then it's less likely that Priya won't get the offer and Diego will. Therefore, based on the given information, it does not follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
