Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

It also implies that if thrillers aren't #1, then romances won't be either, and therefore, mysteries would be the #1 genre. However, the statement also mentions that thrillers are likely to lead sales, which implies that they are more likely to be #1 than romances. Therefore, it's not necessarily true that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that it's likely that, if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be. The statement suggests that thrillers are likely to be #1, and if they aren't, then romances won't be either, but it does not necessarily mean that mysteries will be #1."
