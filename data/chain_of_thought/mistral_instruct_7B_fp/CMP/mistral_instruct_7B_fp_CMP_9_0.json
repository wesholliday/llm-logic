    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement suggests that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed by bananas, with oranges trailing behind. It also implies that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, then bananas won't be either, and if neither apples nor bananas are the top-selling fruit, then oranges will be. However, the statement does not provide enough information to definitively say that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. It only suggests that oranges will be the top-selling fruit if neither apples nor bananas are. Therefore, while it's possible that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, it's not a certainty based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be."
