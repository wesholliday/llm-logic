    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement suggests that the Lakers have the highest probability of winning the NBA championship, followed by the Warriors, and then the Celtics. It also implies that if neither the Lakers nor the Warriors win, then the Celtics will. However, it also states that it is most likely that the Lakers will win, implying that the Warriors are less likely to win. Therefore, if the Lakers don't win, it does not necessarily mean that the Celtics will win with high probability, as the Warriors could still potentially win.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it is not likely that if the Lakers don't win, the Celtics will."
