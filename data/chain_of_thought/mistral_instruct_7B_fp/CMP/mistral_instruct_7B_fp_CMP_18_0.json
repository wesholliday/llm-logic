    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently\" suggests that pizza is the most popular takeout food, followed by burgers, and tacos are the least popular. The statement \"if burgers\u2019 aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be\" implies that if neither pizza nor burgers are the most popular takeout food, then tacos will likely be the most popular. The statement \"pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t\" suggests that pizza is more likely to be the top takeout food, and as a result, burgers are less likely to be the top takeout food.\n\nHowever, the statement \"does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?\" is asking if it follows logically that if pizza is not the most popular takeout food, then tacos will be the most popular.\n\nAnswer: Yes, based on the information given, it follows that if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be the most likely choice. This is because the statement \"if burgers\u2019 aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be\" implies that if neither pizza nor burgers are the most popular takeout food, then tacos will likely be the most popular. And since the statement \"pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t\" suggests that pizza is more likely to be the top takeout food, it follows that if pizza is not the most popular takeout food, then tacos will be the most likely choice."
