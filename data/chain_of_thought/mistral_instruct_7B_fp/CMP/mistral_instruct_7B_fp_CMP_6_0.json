    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement suggests that Taylor Swift's album is projected to sell the most copies, followed by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's far behind. It also states that if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most, then Taylor Swift's won't either, implying that Beyonce's would be the next highest seller in that case. However, the statement also implies that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most, which means that it's less likely for Bad Bunny's or Beyonce's albums to sell more. Therefore, while it's true that if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most, Beyonce's will, it's not as likely as the initial projection that Taylor Swift's album will sell the most.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will. While it's possible, the initial projection suggests that it's less likely."
