    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement suggests that among the three major housing costs (rents, home prices, and mortgage rates), rents are expected to increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising less. The reasoning then states that if either rents or home prices do not increase the most, then the other one that does not increase the most will be mortgage rates. However, the statement also asserts that rents will indeed increase the most, implying that home prices will not increase the most. Therefore, if rents do not increase the most, it means that home prices have not increased the most, which in turn means that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
