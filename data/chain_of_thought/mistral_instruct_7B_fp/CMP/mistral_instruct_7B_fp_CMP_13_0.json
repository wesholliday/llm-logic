    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement suggests that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. It also states that if either Tennessee or Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will. However, it also mentions that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, implying that Georgia is less likely to add the most jobs.\n\nGiven this information, it's not necessarily true that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. The statement only suggests that if neither Tennessee nor Georgia adds the most jobs, then Missouri will. But since Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, it's less likely that neither of them will.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that it's likely that, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will."
