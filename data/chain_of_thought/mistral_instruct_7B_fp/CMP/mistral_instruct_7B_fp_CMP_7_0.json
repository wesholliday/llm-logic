    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement suggests that tidal power is expected to generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. It also states that if neither tidal power nor solar power generates the most electricity, then wind power will. However, the last part of the statement asserts that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, implying that solar power is less likely to do so.\n\nGiven this information, it's not necessarily true that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will. The statement only suggests that if neither tidal power nor solar power generates the most electricity, then wind power will. It does not rule out the possibility that some other unmentioned source of renewable energy could generate more electricity than both tidal and solar power, preventing wind power from being the leading source.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will."
