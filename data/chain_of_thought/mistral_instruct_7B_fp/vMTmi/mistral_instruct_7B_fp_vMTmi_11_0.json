            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that starts with a conditional statement (if P then Q) and concludes that the negation of the consequent (not Q) implies the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry'. The second premise is 'The muffins might not have been blueberry', which is equivalent to 'It is possible that the muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nIf the muffins might not have been blueberry, then it is not the case that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the cake could have been chocolate without the muffins being blueberry. Therefore, the cake could not have been chocolate, which is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
