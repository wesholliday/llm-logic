In this case, P is 'The alien visited Mars' and Q is 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid because the second premise 'The robot might not have visited Jupiter' does not necessarily mean that 'The alien did not visit Mars'. The two statements are not logically connected. The fact that the robot might not have visited Jupiter does not imply that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
