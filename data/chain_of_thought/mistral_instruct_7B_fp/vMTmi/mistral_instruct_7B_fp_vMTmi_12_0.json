In this case, P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid because the second premise 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo' does not necessarily mean that 'Joe did not go to the park'. The truth of the first premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo' is not affected by the possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, the conclusion 'Joe did not go to the park' cannot be logically inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
