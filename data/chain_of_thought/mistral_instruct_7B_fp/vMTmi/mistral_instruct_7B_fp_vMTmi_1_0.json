            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional argument, where the first premise is of the form 'If P, then Q'. The conclusion is not P, but instead, it negates P. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider if the negation of the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument's structure is as follows:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion 'Mary was not at the wedding' is the negation of the first premise 'If Mary was at the wedding'. However, the second premise 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
