            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive reasoning that goes as follows: If P then Q, not Q, therefore not P. In this case, P is 'The apple was red' and Q is 'The banana must have been yellow'.\n\nThe first premise 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This is a material implication, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. If the banana is yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple is red.\n\nThe second premise 'The banana might not have been yellow' is a statement that introduces a possibility that the banana was not yellow. This does not necessarily mean that the apple was not red, but it does provide a reason to question the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion 'The apple was not red' is a contradiction to the first premise. If the apple was not red, then according to the first premise, the banana should not have been yellow. However, the second premise introduces a possibility that the banana was not yellow. This creates a contradiction, which means that the conclusion cannot be logically derived from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
