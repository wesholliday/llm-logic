However, the argument structure seems to contain a contradiction. The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. The second premise, on the other hand, suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel. These two premises cannot both be true at the same time, as they present contradictory information about the book's genre.\n\nSince the argument contains a contradiction, it is not logically valid. The conclusion 'The book was not written by James' cannot be logically derived from the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
