In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nThe argument's structure is as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n2. The mummy might not have been awake.\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\nLet's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false:\n\n1. The vampire was awake.\n2. The mummy might not have been awake.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the first premise is not satisfied, as the vampire being awake does not necessarily mean that the mummy must have been awake. Therefore, it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically invalid. (This is a contradiction, as the argument is often presented as logically valid, but it is not.)"
