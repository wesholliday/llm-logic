To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe argument is not a valid form of reasoning because the second premise 'Chris might not have finished the race' does not logically imply that 'Alex did not finish the race'. The fact that Chris might not have finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex did finish and then Chris did not. It could also mean that neither finished the race. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
