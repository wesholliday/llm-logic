The second premise is 'Bob might not have chosen pasta'. The conclusion is 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nThe logical validity of an argument depends on the form of the argument and whether the premises are true or false. In this case, the form of the argument is important.\n\nThe form of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens and is logically valid. However, the validity of the argument does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is true. The conclusion is only true if the premises are also true.\n\nIn this case, the truth of the premises is not given, so we cannot determine whether the conclusion is true or false. However, we can say that the form of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe argument is logically valid."
