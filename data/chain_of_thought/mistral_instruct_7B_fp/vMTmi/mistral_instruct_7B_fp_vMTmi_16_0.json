In this case, P is 'The shirt was cotton' and Q is 'The pants must have been denim'.\n\nHowever, the second premise 'The pants might not have been denim' introduces a possibility that contradicts the first premise. If the pants might not have been denim, then it's not necessarily true that 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim'. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
