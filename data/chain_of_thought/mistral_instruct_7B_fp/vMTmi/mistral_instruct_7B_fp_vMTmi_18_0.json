            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that starts with a conditional statement (if P then Q) and concludes that the negation of the consequent (not Q) implies the negation of the antecedent (not P). In this case, the conditional statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the negation of the consequent (not Q) implies the negation of the antecedent (not P) in this specific case.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. Premise 2: The truck might not have been metal.\n3. Conclusion: The doll was not plastic.\n\nExplanation of the conclusion:\n\nThe conclusion 'The doll was not plastic' is a logical consequence of the second premise 'The truck might not have been metal' if we assume that the first premise 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' is true.\n\nIf the truck might not have been metal, then it follows that the doll was not plastic, according to the first premise. This is because the first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. If the truck might not have been metal, then it cannot be the case that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid."
