However, the first statement only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. The second statement tells us that the banana was yellow, but it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude 'The apple was red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
