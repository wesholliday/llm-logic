It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The second statement 'The muffins were blueberry' is a fact.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first statement is also true. In other words, just because the muffins are blueberry, it does not mean that the cake must be chocolate. The cake could be any other flavor.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude 'The cake was chocolate'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
