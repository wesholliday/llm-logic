This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the logic of the situation. If the condition in the first statement (Mary was at the wedding) is not true, then the second part of the statement (Sue was at the wedding) could still be true, but this would mean that the first statement is a false conditional. However, since we know that Sue was at the wedding, it means that the condition in the first statement must also be true, and therefore, Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
