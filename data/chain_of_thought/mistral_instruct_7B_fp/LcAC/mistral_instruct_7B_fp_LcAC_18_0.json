However, the second premise 'The truck was metal' does not directly provide information about the doll being plastic. The first premise 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' suggests a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck, but it does not guarantee that the doll is actually plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot logically conclude 'The doll was plastic'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
