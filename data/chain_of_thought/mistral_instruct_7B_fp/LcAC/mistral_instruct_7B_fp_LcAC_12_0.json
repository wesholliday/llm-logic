This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. The second statement is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the first part (Joe went to the park) is true. The second statement only tells us that Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that 'Joe went to the park' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
