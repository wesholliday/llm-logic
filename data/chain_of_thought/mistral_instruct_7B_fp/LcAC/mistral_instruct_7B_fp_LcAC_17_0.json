This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. The second statement given is 'Kate ate salad'.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily mean that Ben also ate pasta. It only means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. But we don't have any information that Ben actually ate pasta. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude 'Ben ate pasta' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
