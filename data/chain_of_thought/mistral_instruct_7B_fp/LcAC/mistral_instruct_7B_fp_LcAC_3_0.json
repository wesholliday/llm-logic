The two premises provided are:\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, the second premise does not directly imply that James wrote the book. The first premise states that if the book is written by James, then it is a mystery novel. But the second premise only tells us that the book is a mystery novel, not that James is its author. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude 'The book was written by James' based on these two premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
