(Let's call this Premise 2.)\n\nTo logically conclude that the griffin was in the forest, we need to use the given premises to form a valid argument.\n\nIn this case, we can use the method of direct instantiation, which involves substituting a specific instance for the variable in the conditional statement. Since Premise 2 tells us that the unicorn is in the forest, we can substitute 'unicorn' for 'griffin' in Premise 1 to get:\n\n1'. If the griffin was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest. (This is a tautology, which means it's always true.)\n\nNow, since Premise 2 tells us that the unicorn is in the forest, we can use Modus Ponens to infer that the griffin is also in the forest, based on Premise 1'.\n\nModus Ponens is a valid logical rule that states: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q is also true.\n\nSo, using Modus Ponens, we can infer that:\n\n1'. If the griffin was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest. (Premise 1' is a tautology, so it's always true.)\n2. The unicorn is in the forest. (Premise 2.)\n\nTherefore, the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
