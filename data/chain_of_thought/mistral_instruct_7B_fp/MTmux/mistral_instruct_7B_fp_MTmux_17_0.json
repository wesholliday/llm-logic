The second premise states that it is not the case that the flob must move, which means that the flob does not necessarily have to move, even if it is skizzled.\n\nFrom these two premises, we cannot infer that 'The flob was not skizzled'. The second premise only tells us that the flob does not necessarily have to move, but it does not tell us anything about whether the flob was skizzled or not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flob was not skizzled' based on the given premises."
