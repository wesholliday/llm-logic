However, if we assume that the dreb was vroombed, and then we see that the dreb did not have to be spened, then we can infer that the dreb was vroombed but did not result in spending. This is a contradiction to the original conditional statement, which states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. Therefore, it is more reasonable to infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, based on the reasoning above, it is more reasonable to infer that the dreb was not vroombed."
