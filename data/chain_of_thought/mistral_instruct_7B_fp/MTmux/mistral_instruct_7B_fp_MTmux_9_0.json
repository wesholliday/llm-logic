The second statement 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished' is negating the conclusion of the first statement, meaning that even though the twonk was plinked, it is not necessarily true that it must have been varnished.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the twonk was not plinked. The second statement only negates the conclusion of the first statement, not the premise. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked'."
