The second statement negates the first one, meaning it's not necessarily true that the splat must have quanked even if it was morphed.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements directly or indirectly states that the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
