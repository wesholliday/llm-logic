            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement, meaning if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. The second statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled' means that it is not necessarily true that the sprocket must have been daggled, even if it was cranked.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not cranked. The second statement only negates the necessity of the sprocket being daggled if it was cranked, but it does not deny the possibility of the sprocket being cranked.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' based on the given information."
