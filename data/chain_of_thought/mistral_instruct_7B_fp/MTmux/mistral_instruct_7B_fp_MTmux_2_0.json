This is a logical implication, and if the first part of the implication is false, then the whole implication is false.\n\nThe negation of the given conditional statement 'It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint' means that it is not the case that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint. This means that there is at least one case where the wug was flooped but did not bim the zoint.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot infer that 'The wug was not flooped'. The negation of the given conditional statement does not imply that the wug was not flooped. It only means that there is at least one case where the wug was flooped but did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
