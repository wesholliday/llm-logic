The second statement negates the conclusion of the first statement, meaning that it is not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink, even if the sneg is crampled.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the state of the sneg being crampled or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sneg was not crampled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
