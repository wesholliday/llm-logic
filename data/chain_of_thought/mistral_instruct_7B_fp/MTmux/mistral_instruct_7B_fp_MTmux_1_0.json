The second statement negates the second part of the first statement, meaning it's not necessarily true that the flugel must have been zargled, even if it was blimmed.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the flugel being blimmed. It only negates the implication that if the flugel is blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n\nSo, from this information, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
