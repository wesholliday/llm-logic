            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This means that it is not necessarily true that Mark bought the blue shirt, but it is also not necessarily false. It could mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, or it could mean that the information is not available or not known.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. If 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is true, then it means that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt. However, the first statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. Since we know that Mark does not necessarily have to buy the blue shirt, it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because if she had, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
