            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim' is a conditional statement, meaning if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. The second statement 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' means that the pants are not necessarily denim, even if the shirt is cotton.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the shirt is not cotton. The second statement only negates the necessity of denim pants if the shirt is cotton, but it does not provide any information about the actual material of the shirt.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The shirt was not cotton' based on the given information."
