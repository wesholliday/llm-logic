            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding'. This means that if Mary is at the wedding, then it is a certainty that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement given is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding'. This means that it is not necessarily true that Sue must be at the wedding. It could be that Sue is not at the wedding, or it could be that we just don't know if Sue is at the wedding.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'. The first statement tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must be as well. The second statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that Sue must be at the wedding. It does not tell us anything about Mary.\n\nHowever, if we consider the possibility that Sue is not at the wedding (as suggested by the second statement), then it is also possible that Mary is not at the wedding, since the first statement tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must be as well. Therefore, while we cannot directly infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, it is a possible conclusion that can be drawn from considering the possibility that Sue is not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nWhile we cannot directly infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, it is a possible conclusion that can be drawn from considering the possibility that Sue is not at the wedding. Therefore, the answer is 'yes', but with the caveat that this is a possible, but not necessarily correct, conclusion."
