            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' is a conditional statement. It means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. The second statement 'It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake' means that it is not necessarily true that the mummy must be awake, even if the vampire is awake.\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. If the second statement is true, then the first statement cannot be used to infer that the vampire is awake. This is because the first statement assumes that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. But if the second statement is true, then this assumption is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the vampire is awake based on the given information.\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information."
