This means that if the cake is chocolate, then it follows that the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nThe second statement given is 'It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry'. This means that it is not necessarily true that the muffins must be blueberry, even if the cake is chocolate.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The cake was not chocolate'. However, we can infer that the second statement contradicts the first statement, and therefore, there must be some condition under which the second statement is true, but the first statement is not. This means that the cake is not necessarily chocolate, and the muffins are not necessarily blueberry.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The cake was not chocolate' based on the given information. However, we can infer that the cake is not necessarily chocolate."
