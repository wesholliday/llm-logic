            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest' is a conditional statement. It means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest' is negating the first statement. It means that even if the griffin is in the forest, it is not necessarily true that the unicorn must be in the forest as well.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'. However, we can infer that the griffin being in the forest is not sufficient to prove that the unicorn must be in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' based on the given information."
