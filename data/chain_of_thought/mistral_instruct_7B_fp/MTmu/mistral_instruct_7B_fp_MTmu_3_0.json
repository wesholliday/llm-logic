            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. It means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. The second statement 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' means that it is not necessarily true that the book must be a mystery novel, even if it was written by James.\n\nHowever, from these two statements, we cannot directly infer 'The book was not written by James'. The second statement only tells us that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, it does not tell us that James did not write the book.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James' based on these two statements."
