            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement. It means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. The second statement 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue' means that the truck does not necessarily have to be blue, even if the car is red.\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily mean that the car is not red. It only means that the truck does not have to be blue, even if the car is red.\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
