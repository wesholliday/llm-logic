            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe going to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. This means that it is not necessary for Lucy to go to the zoo, but it does not necessarily mean that she did not go.\n\nHowever, since the first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must go to the zoo, and the second statement contradicts this by saying that it is not necessary for Lucy to go to the zoo, it means that Joe did not go to the park. This is because if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have had to go to the zoo, but since it is not necessary for Lucy to go to the zoo, it means that Joe could not have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
