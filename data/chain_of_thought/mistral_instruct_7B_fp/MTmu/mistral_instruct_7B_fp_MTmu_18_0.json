            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. The second statement 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal' means that the truck is not necessarily metal, even if the doll is plastic.\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the doll is not plastic. It only means that the truck is not necessarily metal. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
