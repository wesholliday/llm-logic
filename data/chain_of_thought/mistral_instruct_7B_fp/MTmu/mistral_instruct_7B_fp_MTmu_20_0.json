This means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. The second statement given is 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow'. This means that it is not necessarily true that the banana must be yellow, even if the apple is red.\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the apple is not red. It only means that the banana does not have to be yellow, even if the apple is red.\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
