            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball'. This means that if Tom watches football, then it is a certainty that Jen watches basketball. The second statement given is 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball'. This means that it is not necessarily true that Jen watches basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that she does not watch basketball either.\nHowever, since the first statement implies that if Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball, and the second statement contradicts this, it means that Tom cannot be watching football. This is because if Tom were watching football, then Jen would have to be watching basketball, but we know that it is not necessarily true that Jen is watching basketball. Therefore, Tom cannot be watching football.\nAnswer:\nYes."
