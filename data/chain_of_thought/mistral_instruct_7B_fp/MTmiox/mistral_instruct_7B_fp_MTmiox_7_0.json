The second statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked' implies that if the whiffle was shanked (hit poorly), then it would have made the sound 'tink'.\nHowever, these two statements do not provide enough information to infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked'. The first statement leaves open the possibility that the whiffle was hit well and made the sound 'tink', or that it was hit poorly and did not make the sound 'tink'. Without more information, it is not possible to make a definitive statement about whether the whiffle was shanked or not.\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The whiffle was not shanked' based on the given information."
