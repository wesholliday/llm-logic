The second statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled first. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the zinger was fraggled. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
