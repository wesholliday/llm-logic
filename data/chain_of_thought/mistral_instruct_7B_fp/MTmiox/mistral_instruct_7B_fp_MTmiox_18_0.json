The second statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged' implies that if the shank was joined using the process of 'plooking', then it must have been previously joined using 'nugging'. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the shank was actually plooked or not. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The shank was not plooked'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
