The second statement 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled' is a conditional statement that implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled as well. However, this statement does not mean that the flugel was blimmed. It only states that if it was, then it must have been zargled as well.\n\nSince the second statement does not provide enough information to infer that the flugel was not blimmed, we cannot make that conclusion based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
