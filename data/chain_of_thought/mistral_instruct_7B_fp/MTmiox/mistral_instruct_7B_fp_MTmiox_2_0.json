The second sentence 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint' is another conditional statement that suggests if the wug was in a state of 'flooped', then it must have 'bimmed the zoint'. However, neither sentence provides any information about the current state of the wug being 'flooped'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was not flooped' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
