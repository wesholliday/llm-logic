The second statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated' means that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the flob was actually skizzled or not.\n\nSince we cannot infer from the given information that the flob was skizzled, we cannot conclude that 'The flob was not skizzled'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
