The second statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished' means that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the twonk was actually plinked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
