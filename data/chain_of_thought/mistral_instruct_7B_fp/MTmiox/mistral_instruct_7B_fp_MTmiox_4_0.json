The second statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked' is a conditional statement that implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the fribble was actually snurgled or not.\n\nSince the second statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the fribble was not snurgled, we cannot infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
