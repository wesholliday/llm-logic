The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat making the sound 'quank'. It states that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about whether the splat was actually morphed or not. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
