The second statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged' means that if the 'glip' was 'slogged', then it must have 'tragged'.\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about whether the 'glip' was 'slogged' or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' based on these two statements.\nAnswer:\nNo."
