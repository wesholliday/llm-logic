The second statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened' means that if the dreb was vroombed (whatever that means in this context), then it must have been spent.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides enough information to infer that the dreb was not vroombed. The first statement only suggests that the dreb might not have been spent, but it does not say anything about the dreb being vroombed. The second statement only says that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spent, but it does not say that the dreb was vroombed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
