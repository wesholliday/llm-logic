The second statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned' is also a conditional statement, but it is an 'if-then' statement that implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nSince neither statement provides sufficient information to conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
