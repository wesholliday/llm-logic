It only implies that there is a possibility that the smonk did not plagiarize.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the smonk was vreebled (whatever 'vreebled' means in this context), then the smonk must have plagiarized. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the smonk was actually vreebled or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The smonk was not vreebled'. The two statements do not contradict each other, and there is no logical reason to assume that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
