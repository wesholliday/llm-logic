The first statement suggests that the wug might not have been garpled, but it does not necessarily mean that the wug was not garpled. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between being sproinged and being garpled, stating that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, it does not provide any information about whether the wug was sproonged or not.\n\nSince neither statement provides enough information to infer that the wug was not sproonged, we cannot make that conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
