The second statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed' means that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed as well. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the flug was actually blummed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not blummed' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
