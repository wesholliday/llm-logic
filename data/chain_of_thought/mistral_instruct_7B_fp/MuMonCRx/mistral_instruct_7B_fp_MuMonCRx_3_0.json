However, it does not necessarily mean that 'The quork must be zibble wumble'. The two phrases 'wobble' and 'zibble wumble' could be two different aspects or states of the quork, or they could be two separate things that the quork is involved with. Therefore, based on this statement, we cannot infer that 'The quork must be zibble wumble'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
