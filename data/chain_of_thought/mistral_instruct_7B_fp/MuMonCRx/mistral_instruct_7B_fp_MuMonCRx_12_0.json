However, it does not necessarily mean that 'The glorp must be zibble zizz'. The sentence only implies that zibble zizz is one of the components needed to make the glorp quorple, not that the glorp must be zibble zizz itself.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. Based on the given sentence, we cannot infer that 'The glorp must be zibble zizz'."
