            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given sentence 'The quorple must be on the plonk and gribble a grazzle froodle' contains two parts separated by 'and'. The first part is 'The quorple must be on the plonk', and the second part is 'gribble a grazzle froodle'. The 'and' connects two independent clauses, which means both parts are necessary for the sentence to make sense.\n\nHowever, the second part 'gribble a grazzle froodle' is a complete sentence by itself, and it does not depend on the first part for its meaning. Therefore, it is grammatically correct to infer 'The quorple must gribble a grazzle froodle' from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
