            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The movie must have been in English' means that the movie was originally produced or spoken in the English language. However, this does not necessarily mean that the movie was shown to an audience without any subtitles. Some movies that are originally in English may be shown to audiences who do not speak English as their first language, in which case subtitles would be necessary. Therefore, while it is true that the movie was in English, it cannot be inferred with certainty that it was not subtitled.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The movie must have been subtitled or in English' from 'The movie must have been in English'."
