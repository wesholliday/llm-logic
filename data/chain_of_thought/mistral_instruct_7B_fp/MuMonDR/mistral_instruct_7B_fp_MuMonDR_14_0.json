However, it does not provide any information about whether the contract was renewable or not. Renewable contracts are those that can be extended beyond their initial term, while non-renewable contracts cannot. Therefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the contract was renewable or not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The contract must have been renewable or valid for a year'."
