However, the statement does not explicitly mention that the book must be in the library. Therefore, while it is likely that the book is in the library, we cannot infer this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book must be in the library or on the shelf' from 'The book must be on the shelf'."
