However, the term 'formal' is not necessarily the most specific category of formality. There are different levels of formality, such as formal, semi-formal, and informal. Since we only know that the event was 'formal', we cannot infer that it was 'semi-formal or formal' because the term 'formal' already includes the possibility of being semi-formal. Therefore, we cannot make this inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
