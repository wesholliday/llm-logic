However, it does not provide any information about any potential rescheduling. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the meeting was not rescheduled, we cannot infer that it was either. The original statement only implies that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled'. The original statement does not provide enough information to support this inference."
