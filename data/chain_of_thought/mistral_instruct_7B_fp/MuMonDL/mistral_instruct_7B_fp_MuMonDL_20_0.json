            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The event must have been formal' means that the event had a certain level of formality, such as people dressing up and following specific etiquette. However, 'formal' does not necessarily mean 'black-tie'. 'Black-tie' is a specific level of formal dress code, which is more formal than 'formal' dress code. Therefore, while we can infer that the event was formal, we cannot infer that it was a black-tie event based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
