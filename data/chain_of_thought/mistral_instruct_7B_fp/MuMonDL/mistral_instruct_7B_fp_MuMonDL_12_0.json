However, the statement does not provide any information about what happens if the project is not completed by Friday. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that the project must be completed by Friday or next week based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The project must have been completed by Friday or next week' from 'The project must have been completed by Friday'."
