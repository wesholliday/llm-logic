            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays' implies that the restaurant did not operate at all on Mondays. However, the phrase 'had limited hours' suggests that the restaurant was open for part of the day but not for the full day. Since the original statement does not allow for the possibility of limited hours, we cannot infer 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours' directly from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
