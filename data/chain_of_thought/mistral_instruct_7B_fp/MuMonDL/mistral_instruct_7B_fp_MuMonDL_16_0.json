            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily' implies that the room was cleaned every day without any exceptions. However, the phrase 'or as requested' introduces an additional possibility that the room could also be cleaned on demand, in addition to being cleaned daily. This means that the room could be cleaned more frequently than once a day if requested, but it would still be cleaned at least once a day. Therefore, the original statement does not necessarily imply 'The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested', and the two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested' from 'The room must have been cleaned daily'."
