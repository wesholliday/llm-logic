            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The flight must have been delayed' suggests that the flight experienced a delay in its scheduled departure or arrival time. However, the term 'delayed' does not necessarily mean that the flight was rescheduled. It could have been rescheduled, but the original statement does not provide enough information to make that inference. Therefore, while it is possible that the flight was rescheduled, it cannot be inferred from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled' from 'The flight must have been delayed'."
