However, the phrase 'or detailed' adds an additional quality to the report, suggesting that it is not only accurate but also provides a comprehensive and thorough account of the information.\n\nSince the original statement does not include the 'or detailed' part, it is not possible to infer that the report must have been both accurate and detailed based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
