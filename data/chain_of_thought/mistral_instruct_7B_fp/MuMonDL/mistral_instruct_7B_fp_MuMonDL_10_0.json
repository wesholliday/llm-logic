However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the document was approved by someone other than the signer. Therefore, while it is possible that the document was both signed and approved, we cannot infer this from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The document must have been signed or approved' from 'The document must have been signed'."
