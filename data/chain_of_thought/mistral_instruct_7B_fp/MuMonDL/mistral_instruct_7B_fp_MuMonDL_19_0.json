However, it does not necessarily mean that the application was also submitted electronically. The completion and submission of an application are two separate processes. Therefore, while the application was completed online, it is not necessarily true that it was also submitted electronically.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically' from 'The application must have been completed online'."
