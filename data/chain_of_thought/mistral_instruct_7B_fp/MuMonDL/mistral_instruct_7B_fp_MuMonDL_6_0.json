            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The concert must have been sold out' implies that all the tickets for the concert were sold. However, the phrase 'must have been' is used to express a strong probability based on available evidence. In this case, the evidence is that the concert was attended, and since there are no indications of additional tickets being available, it's a strong assumption that the concert was sold out.\n\nHowever, if we want to make the statement more inclusive and cover the possibility of the concert having limited tickets, we can add 'or had limited tickets' to the original statement. This would mean that even if the concert wasn't completely sold out, it had a limited number of tickets available.\n\nAnswer: Yes, based on adding 'or had limited tickets' to the original statement, we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets'."
