From these statements, we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, as there are no other options given. However, the first statement only suggests that the flob might not be movated, not that it definitely is not movated. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer 'The flob is skizzled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
