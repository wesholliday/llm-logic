The phrase 'Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed' implies that there are only two possible states for the grommet: it is either properly installed (plopped) or it is in some other state (sploffed). However, the phrase does not provide any information about what the 'sploffed' state might be. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
