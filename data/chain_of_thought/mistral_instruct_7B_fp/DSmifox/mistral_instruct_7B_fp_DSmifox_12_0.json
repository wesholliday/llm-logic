If it is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nHowever, without any additional information, we cannot infer that 'The smip is shripped' with certainty. The statement 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped' only tells us that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped. It does not necessarily mean that the smip is currently shripped.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The smip is shripped' based on the given information."
