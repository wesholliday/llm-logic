If the fleeg must be surned, then it is not bluttered. However, if the fleeg is bluttered, then it cannot be surned because the statement 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered' implies that if the fleeg is surned, then it cannot be bluttered.\n\nSince 'The fleeg might not be surned' does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
