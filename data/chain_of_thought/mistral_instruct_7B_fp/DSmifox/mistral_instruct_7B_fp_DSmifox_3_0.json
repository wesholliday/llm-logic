The first statement suggests that the splat may or may not be quanked, leaving the possibility open. The second statement states that there are only two possibilities for the splat: it must be quanked or it is morphed. Since the first statement does not rule out the second possibility, we cannot infer that 'The splat is morphed', but it is a possibility.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The splat is morphed' based on the given statements."
