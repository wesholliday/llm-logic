The second statement 'Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that the flugel must be zargled. It could also be blimmed, as the first statement allows for that possibility.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, based on the information given, it is possible that 'The flugel is blimmed'."
