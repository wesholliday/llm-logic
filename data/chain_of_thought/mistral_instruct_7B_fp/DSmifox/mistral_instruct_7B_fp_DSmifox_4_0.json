However, this statement does not provide any information about the fribble being in a 'snurgled' state.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the fribble is not crinkled, then it must be snurgled. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the fribble is currently in a 'snurgled' state. It only means that if it is not crinkled, then it must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'. The statements only provide information about the possible states of the fribble, but they do not provide any evidence that the fribble is currently in a 'snurgled' state.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
