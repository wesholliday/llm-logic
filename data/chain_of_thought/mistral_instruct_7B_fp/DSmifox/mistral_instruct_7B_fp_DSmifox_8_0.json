The second statement 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked' means that there are only two possibilities: either the sprocket is daggled, or it is cranked, and neither can be false.\n\nHowever, the information given does not necessarily mean that the sprocket is cranked. It only means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. But without knowing whether the sprocket is daggled or not, we cannot infer that it is cranked.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The sprocket is cranked' based on the given information."
