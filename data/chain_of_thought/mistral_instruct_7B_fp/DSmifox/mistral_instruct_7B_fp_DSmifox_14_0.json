The first statement suggests that the clug might not be snugged, but it does not necessarily mean that the clug is fleeked. The second statement gives us an alternative condition where the clug is fleeked, but it does not imply that the clug is currently in that state. Therefore, we cannot make this inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
