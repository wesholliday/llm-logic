The second statement 'Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished' suggests that the twonk must be in one of two states: either it is plinked, or it is varnished. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the twonk is not plinked, it only states that if it is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nSince the first statement does not rule out the possibility of the twonk being plinked, and the second statement does not necessarily mean that the twonk is not plinked, we cannot infer 'The twonk is varnished' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
