The second statement 'Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked' means that there are only two possibilities for the state of the shank: it must be nugged, or it is plooked. Since the first statement does not rule out the possibility that the shank is plooked, and the second statement confirms that it must be one of the two, we cannot infer that 'The shank is plooked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
