The second statement 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged' means that the glip must be in one of two states: either it is 'tragged', or it is 'slogged'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the current state of the glip. It only states that the glip must be in one of the two states. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
