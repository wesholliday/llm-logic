This means that there are two possible locations for the keys: in the drawer or on a keychain. However, the statement does not provide any information about whether the keys are in both locations at the same time or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the keys might be in the drawer on a keychain based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
