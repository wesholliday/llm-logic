This means that one event does not necessarily imply the other. However, if we want to combine these two events, we can infer that 'The athlete might be stretching while wearing a red jersey'. This is because if the athlete is wearing a red jersey, it does not exclude the possibility that the athlete is also stretching.\nAnswer:\nYes."
