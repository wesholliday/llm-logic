However, it does not necessarily mean that the book is open on the shelf. The statement only implies that the book is either on the shelf or open, but it does not specify that they are both happening at the same time or in the same location.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The book might be open on the shelf' from the given statement."
