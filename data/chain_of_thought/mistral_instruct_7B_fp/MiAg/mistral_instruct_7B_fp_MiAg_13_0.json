However, it does not specify whether the wilting is happening inside the vase or not. To infer 'The flowers might be wilting in the vase', we need additional information or reasoning to suggest that the wilting is occurring within the vase.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The flowers might be wilting in the vase' based on the given information."
