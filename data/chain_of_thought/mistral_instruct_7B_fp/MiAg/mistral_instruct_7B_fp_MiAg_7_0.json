When we say \"The train might be late and crowded\", we are combining these two possibilities into one statement. Since both \"The train might be late\" and \"The train might be crowded\" are possible, it is also possible that the train is both late and crowded. Therefore, we can infer 'The train might be late and crowded' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
