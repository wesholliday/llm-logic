One scenario is that the child is at school, and the other scenario is that the child is taking a test. However, it does not necessarily mean that the child is taking a test while being at school. To infer that 'The child might be taking a test at school', we need additional information or context that suggests that the child is taking a test while being at school. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The child might be taking a test at school'.\n\nAnswer: No."
