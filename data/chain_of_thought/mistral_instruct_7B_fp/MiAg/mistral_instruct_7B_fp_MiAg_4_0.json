This means that there are two possibilities: the cat is in the garden, or the cat is sleeping. However, it does not necessarily mean that the cat is sleeping in the garden. The two possibilities could be independent of each other. For example, the cat could be sleeping indoors and then be taken out to the garden later. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cat might be sleeping in the garden' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
