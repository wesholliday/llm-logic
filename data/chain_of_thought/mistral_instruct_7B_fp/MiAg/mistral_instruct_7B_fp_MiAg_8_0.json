Here, 'might' is used as a modal verb, indicating that both conditions are possibilities, not certainties.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer 'The restaurant might be expensive and busy' from the given statement. Since the given statement itself is 'The restaurant might be expensive and the restaurant might be busy', the answer is 'yes', as the two statements are identical.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
