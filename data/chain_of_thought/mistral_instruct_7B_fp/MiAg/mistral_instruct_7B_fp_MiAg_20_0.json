The first possibility is that the scientist is present in the lab, but we do not know if they are conducting an experiment. The second possibility is that the scientist is conducting an experiment, but we do not know if they are in the lab. However, since the lab is a common place for conducting experiments, it is reasonable to infer that if the scientist is conducting an experiment, they are likely to be in the lab. Therefore, we cannot definitively say 'yes' based on the given information, but it is a reasonable assumption to make.\n\nAnswer:\nWhile we cannot definitively say 'yes' based on the given information, it is a reasonable assumption to make that 'The scientist might be conducting an experiment in the lab'."
