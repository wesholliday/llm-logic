This means that both conditions can exist simultaneously or independently of each other.\n\nGiven that 'The computer might be on' and 'The computer might be running a virus scan' are two separate possibilities, it is logically valid to infer that 'The computer might be on and running a virus scan'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
