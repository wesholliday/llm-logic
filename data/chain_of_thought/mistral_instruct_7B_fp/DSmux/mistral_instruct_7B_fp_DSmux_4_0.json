The second statement 'It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked' means that the fribble is not in the state where it must be crinked.\n\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily mean that the fribble is snurgled. It only means that the fribble is not in the state where it must be crinked. The statement 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked' does not exclude the possibility that the fribble is neither snurgled nor crinked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
