The second statement 'It's not the case that the dreb must be spened' means that the second condition in the disjunction is not true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the first condition is true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
