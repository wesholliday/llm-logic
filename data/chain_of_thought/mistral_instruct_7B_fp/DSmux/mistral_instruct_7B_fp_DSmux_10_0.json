The second statement 'It's not the case that the wug must be garpled' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that the wug cannot be garpled. Since neither statement explicitly states that the wug is sproinged, we cannot infer 'The wug is sproinged' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
