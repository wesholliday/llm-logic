The second statement 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that the glip is not forced to be tragged. However, this does not necessarily mean that the glip is slogged, as the first part of the disjunction is still open. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
