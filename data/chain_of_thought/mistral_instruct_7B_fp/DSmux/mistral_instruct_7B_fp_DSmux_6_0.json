The second statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped' means that the grommet is not in the state where it must be 'plopped'.\n\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily mean that the grommet is 'sploffed'. It only means that the grommet is not in the state where it must be 'plopped'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet is sploffed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
