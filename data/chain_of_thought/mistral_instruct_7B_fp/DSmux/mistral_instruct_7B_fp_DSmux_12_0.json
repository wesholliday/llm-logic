The second statement 'It's not the case that the smip must be lupped' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that the smip is not forced to be lupped. However, this does not necessarily mean that the smip is shripped, as the first part of the disjunction is still possible. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smip is shripped' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
