The second statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled' means that it is not necessary for the flugel to be zargled, but it does not necessarily mean that the flugel is blimmed either.\n\nHowever, since we know that at least one of the two conditions must be true, and we have ruled out that the flugel must be zargled, then the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
