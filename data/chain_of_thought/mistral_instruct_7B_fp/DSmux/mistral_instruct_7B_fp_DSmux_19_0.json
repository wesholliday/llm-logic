The second statement 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged' negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that the smonk cannot be forced to be plagged. However, this does not necessarily mean that the smonk is vreebled, as the first part of the disjunction is still open. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk is vreebled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
