            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled' means that the sprocket can be in one of two states: either it is cranked or it must be daggled. The second statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled' means that the sprocket is not in the state where it must be daggled.\n\nSince the statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled' does not rule out the possibility of the sprocket being cranked, we cannot infer that 'The sprocket is not cranked'. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
