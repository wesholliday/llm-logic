The second statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' means that the splat is not in the state where it must be quanked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the splat must be in the state where it is morphed, because the only other state mentioned in the first statement is 'must be quanked', which we know is not the case.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
