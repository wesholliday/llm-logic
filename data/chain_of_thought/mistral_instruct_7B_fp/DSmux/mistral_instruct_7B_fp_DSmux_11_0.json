The second statement 'It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed' means that it is not necessary for the flug to be zimmed.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the flug is blummed. The second statement only tells us that the flug is not forced to be zimmed, but it does not tell us that the flug is blummed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flug is blummed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
