The premise states that if the speaker finishes their homework, they can play video games. However, the conclusion introduces an entirely new condition, that the speaker's computer catches on fire, which was not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
