The argument is an example of a fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" This fallacy occurs when the conclusion is a statement that affirms the consequent of the premise, but the argument does not provide any reason to believe that the premise and the conclusion share a common cause or necessary connection.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If I take medication, I will feel better.' The conclusion is 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better.' The argument assumes that taking expired medication will have the same effect as taking non-expired medication, but it does not provide any reason to believe that this is the case.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
