To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe logical form of the argument is:\n\nIf P (you get enough sleep) then Q (you won't be tired)\nAnd P (you get enough sleep)\nTherefore, if P and R (you do hard labor) then Q (you won't be tired)\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired' follows logically from the premise 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired' if and only if doing hard labor does not affect the fact that you won't be tired if you get enough sleep.\n\nHowever, without additional information, it is not possible to determine if doing hard labor affects the fact that you won't be tired if you get enough sleep. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the argument is logically valid based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, it is not possible to determine if the argument is logically valid based on the given information."
