The premise states that if you fill up the gas tank, the car will run. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition that the gas tank has a hole in it. This additional condition negates the effect of filling up the gas tank, as the gas will leak out before it can be used to power the car. Therefore, the argument does not follow a logical sequence of reasoning from the premise to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
