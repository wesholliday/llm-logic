The premise is 'If P (the order is placed), then Q (the item will ship)'. The conclusion is 'If P and R (the item is out of stock), then Q'.\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, it must be the case that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, in this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the order is placed, then the item will ship. This means that if the order is placed, the item will be shipped, assuming that there are no other conditions that prevent it from being shipped.\n\nThe conclusion, however, states that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then the item will still ship. This is not necessarily true. If the item is out of stock, then it cannot be shipped, regardless of whether or not the order has been placed.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
