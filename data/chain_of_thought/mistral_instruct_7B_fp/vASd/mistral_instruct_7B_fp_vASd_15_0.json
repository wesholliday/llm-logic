The conclusion is 'If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power'.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to consider if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, is it necessarily true that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is not logically valid because the premise does not guarantee that the battery will be dead when you charge the phone. Even if you charge your phone, it does not mean that it had a dead battery before charging. Therefore, it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
