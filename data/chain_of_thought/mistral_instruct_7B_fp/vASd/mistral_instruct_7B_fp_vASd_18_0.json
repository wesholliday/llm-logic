            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement followed by another conditional statement with an additional condition. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe logical form of the argument can be represented as:\n\nP: If I water the plants, they will grow.\nC: If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only states that if the plants are watered, they will grow. It does not say anything about the plants' growth in the absence of sunlight. Therefore, it is possible that the plants will not grow even if they are watered and there is no sunlight.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
