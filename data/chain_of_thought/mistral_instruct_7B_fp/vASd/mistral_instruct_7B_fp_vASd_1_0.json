The premise states that if the match is struck, then it will light. However, the conclusion states that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light. The soaking of the match in water changes the match's ability to light, so the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
