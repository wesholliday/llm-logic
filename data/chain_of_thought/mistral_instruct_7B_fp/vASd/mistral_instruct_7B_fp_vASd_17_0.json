The logical form of the argument can be represented as:\n\nIf P (I change the oil), then Q (the car will run smoothly)\nAnd, if P and R (the transmission is shot), then S (the car will run smoothly)\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because it does not follow the rules of logical inference. Specifically, the argument assumes that if P (changing the oil) leads to Q (the car running smoothly), then P and R (changing the oil and the transmission being shot) will also lead to Q (the car running smoothly). However, this is not necessarily true. The transmission being shot could prevent the car from running smoothly, even if the oil has been changed.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
