In other words, we need to see if the argument's structure is such that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe argument's structure is as follows:\n\nPremise: If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\nConclusion: If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nThe conclusion is an extension of the premise, where the additional condition is that the essay is turned in late. However, the argument does not provide any information about how lateness affects the grading of a well-written essay. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
