The premise states that 'If I exercise, I will lose weight'. However, the conclusion is 'If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight'. The introduction of eating junk food as a new condition in the conclusion changes the original claim made in the premise. Eating junk food generally leads to weight gain, not loss, so it contradicts the original claim that exercise leads to weight loss. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
