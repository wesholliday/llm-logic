This is an if-then statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true.\n\nThe second statement is 'The book is a mystery novel'. This statement tells us that the consequence of the if-then statement is true.\n\nHowever, the if-then statement does not necessarily mean that the condition is also true. It only means that if the condition is true, then the consequence is also true. In other words, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James based on the fact that the book is a mystery novel, because the book could have been written by someone else and still be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude 'The book was written by James' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
