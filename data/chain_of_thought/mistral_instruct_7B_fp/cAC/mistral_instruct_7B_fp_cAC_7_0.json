It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. The second statement 'Chris finished the race' tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\nSince the second statement is a fact that confirms the condition in the first statement, we can conclude that Alex also finished the race.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
