This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about the original conditional statement. The 'if' part of the statement (Mary was at the wedding) is not explicitly stated to be true or false. However, since the second part of the statement (Sue was at the wedding) is true, and the conditional statement tells us that if the first part is true, then the second part must also be true, we can infer that the first part (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
