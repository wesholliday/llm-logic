It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. The second statement 'The truck was metal' tells us that the truck actually is made of metal.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not guarantee that the doll is plastic. It only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. But we don't have any information about the doll being plastic. So, even though the truck is metal, we cannot conclude that the doll is plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
