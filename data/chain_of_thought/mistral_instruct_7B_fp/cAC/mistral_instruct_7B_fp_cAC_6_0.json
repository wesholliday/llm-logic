This is a conditional statement, meaning that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must choose pasta. The second statement given is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. The conditional statement only tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would choose pasta. But we don't have any information about whether Sue actually chose pizza or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude 'Sue chose pizza' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
