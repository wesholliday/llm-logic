The second statement tells us that the banana is indeed yellow.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the apple is red. The conditional statement only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. It does not guarantee that the apple is red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude 'The apple was red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
