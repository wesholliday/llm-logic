It means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. The second statement 'The mummy was awake' tells us that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\nNow, to conclude whether the vampire is awake or not, we need to check if the first condition (vampire being awake) leads to the second condition (mummy being awake), given that the second condition is true.\n\nSince the mummy is awake, and the first statement tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, we can infer that the vampire must also be awake.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
