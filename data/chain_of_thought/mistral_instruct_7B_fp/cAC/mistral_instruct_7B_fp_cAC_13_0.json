If the condition is true, then the consequence must be true.\n2. If the condition is false, then the consequence can be either true or false.\n\nIn this case, the condition is 'The car is red' and the consequence is 'The truck is blue'.\n\nLet's check if the first statement is a valid conditional statement:\n1. If the condition 'The car is red' is true, then the consequence 'The truck is blue' must be true. This is true in this case, so the first part of the conditional statement is valid.\n2. If the condition 'The car is red' is false, then the consequence 'The truck is blue' can be either true or false. In this case, we don't have enough information to determine if it's true or false, but since the first part of the conditional statement is valid, it doesn't matter if the second part is not always true when the condition is false.\n\nNow that we know the first statement is a valid conditional statement, let's check if the second statement satisfies the condition in the first statement:\nThe second statement is 'The truck was blue'. This means that at some point in time, the truck was blue.\n\nSince the first statement is a valid conditional statement and the second statement satisfies the condition in the first statement (the truck being blue), we can conclude that at some point in time, the car must have been red.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
