            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'The artwork might be authentic' suggests that the artwork is believed to be created by the original artist. However, this does not necessarily mean that the artwork is valuable or worth millions. The value of an artwork is determined by various factors such as its rarity, historical significance, condition, and market demand. Therefore, even if the artwork is authentic, it might not be worth millions.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The artwork might be worth millions' from 'The artwork might be authentic and worth millions'. The second part of the statement 'and worth millions' is an additional assumption that is not logically necessary given the first part."
