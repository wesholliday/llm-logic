It only means that quarantine might be required for some reason, which could be due to the disease being contagious or for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, while it is possible that the disease is contagious and requires quarantine, the statement 'The disease might require quarantine' does not allow us to infer that the disease is contagious.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that 'The disease might be contagious' from 'The disease might require quarantine'."
