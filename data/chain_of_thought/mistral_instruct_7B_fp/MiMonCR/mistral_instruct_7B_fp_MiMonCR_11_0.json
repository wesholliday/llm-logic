However, it does not necessarily mean that the contract has hidden clauses without further information. The statement only suggests that the contract might have hidden clauses, and it is not definitive proof.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on the given statement, it is possible to infer that 'The contract might have hidden clauses'. However, it is important to note that this is not a definitive conclusion, and further investigation would be required to confirm the presence of hidden clauses in the contract."
