However, the second part of the question 'can we infer 'The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble'?' asks if we can infer that the quorple can also be in 'zizz zump wobble'.\n\nTo infer this, we would need some additional information or context that suggests that 'zizz zump wobble' is another possible location for the quorple. Without such information, we cannot make this inference based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. We cannot infer 'The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble' based on the given statement 'From 'The quorple must be in quazzle','."
