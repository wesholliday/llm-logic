However, it does not exclude the possibility that the wozzle could also be something else, such as 'gorp' or 'glorp'. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp', we cannot also definitively say that it is not.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp' based on the given statement."
