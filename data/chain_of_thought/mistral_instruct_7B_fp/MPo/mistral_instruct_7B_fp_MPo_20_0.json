In a conditional statement, the first part (the apple being red) is called the antecedent, and the second part (the banana being yellow) is called the consequent.\n\nThe 'if-then' statement means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The apple was red', and the consequent is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nSo, to infer 'The banana was yellow', we need to check if the antecedent is true. If the antecedent is true, then according to the conditional statement, the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on the given information, we can infer that 'The banana was yellow'."
