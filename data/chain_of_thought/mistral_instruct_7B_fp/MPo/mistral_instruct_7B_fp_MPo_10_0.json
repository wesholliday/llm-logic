This means that if the dog is inside, then it follows that the cat is outside. However, the given information does not necessarily mean that the cat is outside at the current moment. It only means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. To infer that the cat is outside, we would need additional information that confirms that the dog is inside at the current moment.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The cat was outside' based on the given information."
