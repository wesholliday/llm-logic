The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. Since we know that the first part is true, according to the conditional statement, the second part must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
