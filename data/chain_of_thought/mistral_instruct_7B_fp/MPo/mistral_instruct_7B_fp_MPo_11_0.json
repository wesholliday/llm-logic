This means that if the cake is chocolate, then it follows that the muffins are blueberry. However, the given information does not necessarily mean that the muffins are blueberry without any additional information indicating that the cake is indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The muffins were blueberry' based on the given information. The conditional statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' only establishes a relationship between the cake and the muffins, but it does not provide any information about the actual state of the cake. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the color of the muffins."
