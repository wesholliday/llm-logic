The 'if' part is the condition, and the 'then' part is the consequence. In this case, if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nHowever, the given information does not necessarily mean that Erin took a train. It only means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. But we don't have any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that Erin took a train based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo. We cannot infer that Erin took a train based on 'Sam took a plane' and 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'."
