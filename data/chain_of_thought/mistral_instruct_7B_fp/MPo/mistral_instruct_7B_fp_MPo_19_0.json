            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Tom watched football' tells us that Tom engaged in watching football. The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It means that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. However, it does not necessarily mean that Jen watches basketball when Tom is not watching football.\n\nTo infer 'Jen watched basketball', we would need more information. The conditional statement only tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. It does not tell us that Jen watches basketball when Tom does not watch football.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Jen watched basketball' based on the given information."
