            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The doll was plastic' tells us that the doll is made of plastic. The second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, this statement does not mean that the truck is actually metal. It only establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. To infer that the truck is actually metal, we would need additional information or a statement that confirms this.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The truck was metal' based on the given information."
