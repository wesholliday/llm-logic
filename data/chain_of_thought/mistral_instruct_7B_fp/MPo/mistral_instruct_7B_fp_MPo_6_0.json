This means that Sue selected pizza as her choice.\n\nThe second statement is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the given information does not necessarily mean that Bob actually chose pasta. The conditional statement only tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. But we don't have any information about whether Sue actually chose pizza or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Bob chose pasta' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
