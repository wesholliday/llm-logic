            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The car was red' is a fact about the color of the car. The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first condition (the car being red) is true, then the second condition (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, the conditional statement does not guarantee that the truck is blue if the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was blue' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
