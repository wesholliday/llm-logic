            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is a fact about Lisa's purchase. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. However, the conditional statement does not necessarily mean that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa bought the red shirt is not true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
