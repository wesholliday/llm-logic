            "content": "Explanation:\nTo infer that the book is a mystery novel, we need to establish a valid logical connection between the two statements given. The first statement is 'The book was written by James'. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe second statement is an if-then statement, which means it establishes a condition. In this case, the condition is that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the condition in the second statement is true. It only states that James wrote the book, but it does not specify what kind of book it is. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
