            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nThe argument's structure is as follows:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (Premise 1)\n2. The book is a mystery novel. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James. (Conclusion)\n\nThis is an example of a type of argument known as a \"modus ponens\" argument, which is logically valid if its first premise is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and its second premise is the consequent of that conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, Premise 1 is a conditional statement, and Premise 2 is the consequent of that statement. If Premise 2 is true, then according to the conditional statement in Premise 1, Premise 1's antecedent (the book was written by James) must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
