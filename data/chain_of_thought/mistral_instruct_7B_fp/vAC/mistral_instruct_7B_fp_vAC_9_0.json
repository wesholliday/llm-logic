            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement followed by the consequent of that statement, and then the antecedent of that statement. This is known as modus ponens in logical reasoning. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the conclusion to be false given that the premises are true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. The second premise is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The conclusion is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nGiven that the second premise is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), and the argument is in the form of modus ponens, it follows that the first premise must also be true (Lisa bought the red shirt). This is because the truth of the second premise implies the truth of the first premise's consequent, and the first premise states that the consequent implies the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
