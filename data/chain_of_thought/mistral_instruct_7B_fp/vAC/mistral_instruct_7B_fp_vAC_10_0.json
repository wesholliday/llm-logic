            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, does the conclusion have to be true as well?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (Premise 1)\n2. The cat was outside. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the dog was inside. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the first premise is an if-then statement. To evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the method of reductio ad absurdum, which involves assuming the opposite of the conclusion and showing that it leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet's assume the opposite of the conclusion:\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (Premise 1)\n2. The cat was outside. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the dog was not inside. (Assuming the opposite of the conclusion)\n\nNow, let's see if this assumption leads to a contradiction:\n\nIf the dog was not inside, then according to Premise 1, the cat must have been inside. But Premise 2 states that the cat was outside. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both the cat being inside and outside at the same time.\n\nSince the assumption of the opposite of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
