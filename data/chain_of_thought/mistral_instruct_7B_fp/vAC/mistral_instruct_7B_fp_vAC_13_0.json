The first premise states 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement that, if true, means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise is 'The truck was blue'. This statement is a fact that is asserted to be true.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The car was red'. This is the opposite of the first premise's antecedent.\n\nHowever, just because the truck is blue does not logically imply that the car is red. The argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
