In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the first premise is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. The second premise is 'Amy played tennis'. The conclusion is 'Jeff played basketball'.\n\nThe form of this argument is a classic example of modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement 'P -> Q' and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nSo, in this case, the conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. The second premise tells us that 'Amy played tennis'. If 'Amy played tennis' is true, then according to the conditional statement, 'Jeff played basketball' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion 'Jeff played basketball' follows logically from the premises 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' and 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
