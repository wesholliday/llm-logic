            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'not P or Q'. In this case, P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nThe argument's structure is as follows:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. (P implies Q)\n2. Chris finished the race is true. (Q is true)\n3. Therefore, Alex finished the race. (P is true)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nGiven that the material conditional 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'not P or Q', and we know that Q is true (from the second premise), we can infer that either P is true (Alex finished the race) or not P is true (Alex did not finish the race). However, since we are given that 'Chris finished the race is true', it means that Chris did finish the race, which implies that Alex also finished the race (given the first premise). Therefore, the truth of the premises does guarantee the truth of the conclusion, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
