            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Premise 2: Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom these two premises, we want to infer that Tom watched football.\n\nTo do this, we use the concept of modus ponens, which states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nIn our case, P is 'Jen watched basketball', and Q is 'Tom watched football'. If we can show that P implies Q, and P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nSo, let's check if 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a valid implication. This means we need to check if the statement 'Tom watched football' implies 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nIf Tom watched football, then according to the first premise, Jen must have watched basketball. Therefore, the implication 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is valid.\n\nNow that we know the implication is valid, and we have a true premise (P), we can conclude that the conclusion 'Tom watched football' must also be true (Q).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
