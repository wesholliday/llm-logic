            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise 1)\n2. The mummy was awake (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was awake (Conclusion)\n\nExplanation of the argument structure:\nThis is a conditional argument, where the first premise is a conditional statement (if-then statement). The conclusion is drawn from this conditional statement and the second premise.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the mummy was awake (Premise 2), does that mean the vampire must have been awake (Conclusion)?\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, if the mummy was awake (Premise 2), then according to the first premise, the vampire must have been awake as well. Therefore, the argument is logically valid."
