            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a material conditional. The first premise states 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement that, if true, establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. The second premise is 'The pants were denim'. This statement, if true, satisfies the condition in the first premise, as it states that the pants are denim, which is what the first premise says would follow if the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The shirt was cotton'. This statement is trying to draw a conclusion based on the first premise and the second premise. However, the second premise only satisfies the condition in the first premise, it does not establish that the shirt is cotton. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo. The argument is not logically valid."
