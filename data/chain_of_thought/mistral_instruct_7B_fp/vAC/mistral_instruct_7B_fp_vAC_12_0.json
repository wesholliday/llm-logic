            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (Premise 1)\n2. Lucy went to the zoo (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Joe went to the park (Conclusion)\n\nThe form of this argument is a conditional statement (if-then) followed by an instance of that condition, and then the conclusion is drawn from the instance. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nIn modus ponens, if the conditional statement is true and the instance of the condition is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, to check if this argument is valid, we need to see if Premise 1 is a true conditional statement and if Premise 2 is an instance of the condition in Premise 1.\n\nIf Premise 1 is a true conditional statement, then it means that whenever the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) is also true.\n\nIf Premise 2 is an instance of the condition in Premise 1, then it means that the condition in Premise 1 is true (Joe went to the park).\n\nIf both Premise 1 and Premise 2 are true, then the conclusion must also be true (Joe went to the park).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, this argument is logically valid."
