            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n2. The truck was metal. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the doll was plastic. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (Premise 1) and its consequent (Premise 2), followed by an application of the consequent (Conclusion).\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we can use the method of substitution. We substitute the consequent of the conditional statement (Premise 1) for the original statement in the second premise (Premise 2). If the resulting statement is logically equivalent to the conclusion, then the argument is valid.\n\nSubstituting 'the truck was metal' for 'if the doll was plastic' in Premise 1, we get 'the doll was plastic, therefore the truck was metal'. This is not logically equivalent to the conclusion 'the doll was plastic'.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
