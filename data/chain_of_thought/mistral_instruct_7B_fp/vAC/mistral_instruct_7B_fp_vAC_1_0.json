            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe form of argument being considered is a type of conditional argument, specifically a modus ponens argument. In a modus ponens argument, we have two premises: a conditional statement (if P then Q) and the statement that P is true. The conclusion of the argument is that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', and the second premise is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means it has the form 'If P then Q'. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\n2. The second premise is a statement that asserts that P is true, i.e., 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\n3. The conclusion is that Q is true, i.e., 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\n4. Since the second premise asserts that P is true, and the first premise tells us that if P is true, then Q is also true, it follows logically that Q must be true as well.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
