This does not necessarily mean that she definitely did not buy it, but it does open up the possibility that she might not have bought it. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Lisa must not have bought the red shirt, but we can infer that she might not have bought it based on the information given.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
