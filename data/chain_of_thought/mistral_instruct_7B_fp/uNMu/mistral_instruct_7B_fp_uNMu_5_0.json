However, this does not necessarily mean that Jeff never played basketball in any scenario. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that Jeff might have played basketball, we also cannot rule out the possibility that he might not have played basketball.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer that Jeff might not have played basketball."
