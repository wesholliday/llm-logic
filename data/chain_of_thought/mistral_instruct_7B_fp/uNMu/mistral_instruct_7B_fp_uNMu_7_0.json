However, this does not mean that Alex definitely did not finish the race. It only means that the statement \"Alex must have finished the race\" is not true. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that Alex finished the race, but we can infer that there is a possibility that Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
