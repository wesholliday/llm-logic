However, this does not necessarily mean that the dog was definitely outside. It could also mean that the dog was in another location, such as the backyard, garage, or even on a leash outside the house. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the dog was inside, we also cannot infer with certainty that the dog was not inside or that the dog was definitely outside.\n\nHowever, if we are looking for a possibility where the dog might not have been inside, then based on the information given, that possibility exists.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
