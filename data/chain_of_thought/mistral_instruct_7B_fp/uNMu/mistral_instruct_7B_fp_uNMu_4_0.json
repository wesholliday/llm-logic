This does not necessarily mean that the alien has definitely not visited Mars, but it does leave the possibility open. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the alien might not have visited Mars, but we can say that based on the given information, it is also not unreasonable to consider the possibility that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it is possible."
