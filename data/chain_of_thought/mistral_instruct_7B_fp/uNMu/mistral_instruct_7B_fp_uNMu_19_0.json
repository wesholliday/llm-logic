However, this does not necessarily mean that the watch is not charging on the dresser in all situations. To infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, we would need additional information suggesting that the watch is not charging there in the current situation or in general.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser based on the given information."
