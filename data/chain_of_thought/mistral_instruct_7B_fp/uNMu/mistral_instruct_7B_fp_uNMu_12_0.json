However, this does not necessarily mean that the jacket is not draped over the chair in all situations. To infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair, we would need additional information or context suggesting that the jacket is not typically or usually draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Based on the information given, we cannot infer with certainty that the jacket might not be draped over the chair. However, if we have additional information suggesting that the jacket is not typically or usually draped over the chair, then we could infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair."
