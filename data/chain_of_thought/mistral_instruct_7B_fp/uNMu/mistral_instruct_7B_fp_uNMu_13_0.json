However, this does not necessarily mean that the toy is always not in the toy box. It only means that there is at least one instance where it's not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the toy might not be in the toy box, but we also cannot say for sure that it is.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the toy might not be in the toy box based on the given information."
