However, this does not necessarily mean that the notebook is not in the drawer in all situations. But since we don't have any information to the contrary, we cannot definitively say that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
