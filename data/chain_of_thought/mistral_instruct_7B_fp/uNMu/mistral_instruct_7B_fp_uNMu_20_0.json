However, this does not mean that the sunglasses are definitely not in her bag in all scenarios. It only means that the necessity of the sunglasses being in her bag is not established. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, but we can infer that it is a possibility.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
