However, this does not necessarily mean that the shoes are definitely not in the closet in all scenarios. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the shoes are in the closet, we also cannot rule out the possibility that they might be in the closet. But based on the information given, it is more reasonable to infer that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it can be inferred that the shoes might not be in the closet."
