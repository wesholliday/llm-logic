            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box' means that the toy can be in one of two places: either on the shelf or in the toy box. The second statement 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf' tells us that the toy is not in its first possible location (on the shelf). Since we know that the toy is not on the shelf, and the toy must be in one of the two places, it follows logically that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
