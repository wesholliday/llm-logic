The second statement 'Fido is not in the garden' tells us that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside. It only means that Fido is not in the garden. The first statement does not exclude the possibility that Fido is outside, but not in the garden. For example, Fido could be in the backyard, which is not the garden.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
