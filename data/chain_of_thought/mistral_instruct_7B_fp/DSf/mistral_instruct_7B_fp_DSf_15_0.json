The first possibility is that the shoes are lined up by the door, and the second is that they are in the closet.\n\nThe second statement 'The shoes aren't lined up by the door' tells us that the first possibility is not true. However, it does not necessarily mean that the second possibility is true. The shoes could be somewhere else, such as under the bed or scattered around the room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The shoes are in the closet'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
