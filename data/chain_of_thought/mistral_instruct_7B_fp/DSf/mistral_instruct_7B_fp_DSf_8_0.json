Therefore, the remote control cannot be under the couch.\n\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily mean that the remote control is on the coffee table. It only means that the remote control is not under the couch. It could be somewhere else, such as lost or in another room.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table' based on the given information."
