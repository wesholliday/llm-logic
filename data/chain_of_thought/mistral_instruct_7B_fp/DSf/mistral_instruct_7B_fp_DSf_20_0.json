The statement 'The sunglasses aren't perched on her head' means that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\nSince the statement 'The sunglasses aren't perched on her head' does not contradict the statement 'Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag', it follows that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
