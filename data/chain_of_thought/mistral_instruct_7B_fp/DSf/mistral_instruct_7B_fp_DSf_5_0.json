However, the statement 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry' tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar.\n\nSince the statement 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry' does not provide enough information to conclude that the cookies are in the jar, we cannot infer 'The cookies are in the jar' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
