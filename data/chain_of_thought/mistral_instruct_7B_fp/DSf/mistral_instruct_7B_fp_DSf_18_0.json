The second statement 'The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand' tells us that the notebook is not in the first place mentioned (on the nightstand). Since we know that the notebook is not on the nightstand, and we also know that it must be in one of the two places mentioned, then the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
