The first statement tells us that the pen must be either on the desk or in the bag, and there is no other possibility.\n3. The second statement tells us that the pen is not on the desk.\n4. Since the pen cannot be both on the desk and not on the desk, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. Based on the given statements, we can infer that the pen is in the bag."
