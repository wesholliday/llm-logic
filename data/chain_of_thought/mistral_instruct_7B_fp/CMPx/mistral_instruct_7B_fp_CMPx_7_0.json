    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement suggests that the crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. It also states that if neither the crastin nor the nivet leads in births, then the jomial will. However, it also implies that the crastin is likely to lead in births, and if the crastin doesn't, then the nivet likely won't either.\n\nThis creates a contradiction, as the statement suggests that if the crastin doesn't lead in births, then the jomial will, but it also implies that if the crastin doesn't lead, then the nivet is also unlikely to lead. Therefore, it's not clear from the given information whether it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will.\n\nAnswer: It is not clear."
