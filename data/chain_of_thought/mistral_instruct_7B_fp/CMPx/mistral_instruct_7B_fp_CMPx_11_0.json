    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it\" means that if neither the trenist nor the lanken wins the award, then the draloid must be the winner. The statement \"the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it\" means that it is more likely that the trenist will win the award than the lanken.\n\nHowever, the statement \"it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will\" is not necessarily true based on the given information. While it is true that if the trenist does not win, then the draloid will win, it does not mean that it is likely that the trenist will not win. The statement \"the trenist likely will win the award\" implies that it is more likely that the trenist will win than the lanken, but it does not mean that it is impossible for the trenist to lose. Therefore, while it is possible that the trenist will not win and the draloid will, it is not necessarily likely.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it is not necessarily likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will."
