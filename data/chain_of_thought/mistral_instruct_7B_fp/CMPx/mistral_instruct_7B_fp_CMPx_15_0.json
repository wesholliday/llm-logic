    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given suggests that the fantole has the best odds to win the Rizzle Cup, followed by the dribban. The snorpul is a heavy longshot. It's also stated that if the dribban doesn't win, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win. This implies a chain of events: fantole wins > dribban wins > snorpul wins. However, the statement also suggests that the fantole is likely to win the cup, which implies a lower likelihood of the dribban and snorpul winning. But since the fantole's win implies the dribban's win, and the dribban's non-win implies the snorpul's win, if the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul is the only remaining option. Therefore, it's likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
