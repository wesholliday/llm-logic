    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement tells us that the trendel is the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, and the doffen is a long shot to win. It also states that if the laxum doesn't win, then if the trendel doesn't win, the doffen will win. This means that there are only three possible outcomes: the trendel wins, the laxum wins, or the doffen wins.\nGiven that the trendel is likely to win, it follows that the laxum is less likely to win. Since the laxum is not expected to win, and if the laxel doesn't win, then the doffen will win, it is reasonable to conclude that it is likely that if the trendel doesn't win, the doffen will.\nAnswer:\nYes."
