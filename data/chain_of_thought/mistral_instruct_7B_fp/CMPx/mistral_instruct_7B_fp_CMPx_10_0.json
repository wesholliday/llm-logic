    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement suggests that the fantole is expected to have the most downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit having significantly fewer downloads. It also states that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the dribban won't be either, implying that the cruggit would take the second place. However, the statement also mentions that the fantole is likely to lead in downloads, which seems to contradict the earlier statement that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the dribban won't be. This contradiction makes it difficult to definitively say that it's likely that, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the given information, it is not likely that, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be. The contradictory statements make it unclear which app will take the second place if the fantole isn't the most downloaded."
