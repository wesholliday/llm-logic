    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dasetil, a lentum, and a vifali are competing to be this year's batalit. The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe information given states that the dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed by the lentum, and the vifali is trailing way behind. It also states that if the lentum isn't the batalit, then if the dasetil isn't the batalit, the vifali will be. This means that the order of likelihood is dasetil > lentum > vifali, and if the dasetil and lentum are both not the batalit, then the vifali becomes the next most likely candidate.\n\nGiven that the dasetil is ahead, it is more likely that they will become the batalit. Therefore, it is less likely that the lentum will become the batalit, and even less likely that the vifali will become the batalit. However, since it is stated that if both the dasetil and lentum are not the batalit, then the vifali will be, it follows that it is still possible, although less likely, that if the dasetil isn't the batalit, the vifali will be.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
