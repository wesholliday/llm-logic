    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t\" suggests that the jantiz has a high probability of being selected for the zulision, which in turn means that the cramen has a low probability of being selected. If the jantiz does not get the zulision, then the cramen would be the next most qualified applicant. Since the cramen's chances of getting the zulision were already low due to the jantiz's qualifications, it can be inferred that if the jantiz does not get the zulision, the sulect, who has even weaker qualifications, is even less likely to get it.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
