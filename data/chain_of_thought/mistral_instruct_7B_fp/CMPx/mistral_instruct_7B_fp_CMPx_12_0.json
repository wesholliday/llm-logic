    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If the vanoon isn't selected, then the stribben likely won't be selected either, as the owner prefers the stribben over the vanoon. If both the stribben and the vanoon are not selected, then the jentapp will be selected. Since the stribben is likely to be chosen, it means that the vanoon is less likely to be chosen. However, if the stribben isn't selected, it doesn't necessarily mean that the jentapp will be selected. The owner might choose not to rent the bondle to anyone if neither the stribben nor the vanoon is suitable.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be. The owner might choose not to rent the bondle to anyone if neither the stribben nor the vanoon is suitable."
