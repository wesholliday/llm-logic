    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

If the crappen doesn't win, then the vringlet must have also lost, as it is the only other finalist. In this case, the strorvil would be the only remaining finalist and would therefore win the award.\n\nThe statement \"the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win\" means that the bloffu critics believe that the vringlet is the most likely winner of the Liggerton Award. If the vringlet is the most likely winner, then it is less likely that the crappen will win.\n\nHowever, the statement \"does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?\" does not necessarily follow from the previous statements. While it is true that if the vringlet doesn't win, then the strorvil will win, it does not mean that it is likely that the vringlet will not win. The statement \"the vringlet likely will win the award\" means that it is more likely that the vringlet will win than the crappen or the strorvil. Therefore, it is not necessarily likely that the vringlet will not win, and therefore it is not necessarily likely that the strorvil will win.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, it does not follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will."
