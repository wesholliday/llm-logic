    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe statement suggests that the garplex is most likely to win, followed by the beelhet, and the peedonk has a much lower chance. It also mentions that if the beelhet doesn't become domer, then if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer. This implies a conditional relationship between the three candidates.\n\nHowever, the statement also suggests that it is likely the garplex will become domer, and hence the beelhet likely won't become domer. This seems to contradict the earlier statement that if the garplex doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer.\n\nTo resolve this apparent contradiction, we need to consider the likelihood of the garplex not becoming domer. If the garplex is indeed likely to become domer, as suggested, then it's less likely that the beelhet or the peedonk will become domer. In this case, the probability of the garplex not becoming domer would be relatively low, and therefore, the probability of the peedonk becoming domer under this condition would also be low.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will. The statement suggests that if the garplex and the beelhet both fail to become domer, then the peedonk will become domer. However, given that the garplex is likely to become domer, the probability of the peedonk becoming domer under the condition that the garplex doesn't become domer is low."
