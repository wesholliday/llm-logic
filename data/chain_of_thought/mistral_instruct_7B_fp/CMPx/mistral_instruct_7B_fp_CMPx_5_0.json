    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

It also implies that if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then the votal will. This means that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, it's possible that the darpil could lead, but since the darpil is expected to come second, it's more likely that the votal will lead if the fraglen doesn't.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it's likely that, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will."
