This means that there is a direct relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, where if Sue chooses pizza, Bob must choose pasta.\n\nThe second statement given is that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that there is a possibility that Bob did not follow the rule established in the first statement.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about Sue's choice. It only tells us that Bob might have broken the rule, but it does not mean that Sue followed the rule and chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
