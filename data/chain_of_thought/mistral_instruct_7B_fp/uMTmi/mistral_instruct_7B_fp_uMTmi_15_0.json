This is a conditional statement, meaning that if one event (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then another event (Erin taking a train) must also occur. However, the second statement given is 'Erin might not have taken a train.' This means that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, even if Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
