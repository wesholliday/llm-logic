However, the second statement is \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This means that it is possible for Chris not to have finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Alex did not finish the race. If Alex did not finish the race, then according to the first statement, Chris also did not finish the race. But this contradicts the second statement, which says that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race."
