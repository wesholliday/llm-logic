The second statement is \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, even if Tom watched football.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about whether or not Tom actually watched football. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
