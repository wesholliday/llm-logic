            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, the second statement \"The truck might not have been blue\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. It suggests that even if the car is red, the truck does not necessarily have to be blue. This means that the truck could have been any color, not just blue. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the car was not red."
