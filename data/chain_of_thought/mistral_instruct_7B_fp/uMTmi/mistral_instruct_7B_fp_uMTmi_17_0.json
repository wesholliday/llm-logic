The second statement is \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This statement does not contradict the first one, as it only means that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad, not that she definitely did not. However, the first statement does not allow for the possibility that Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta."
