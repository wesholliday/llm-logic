It means that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo. However, the statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" means that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo, even if Joe went to the park. This means that the condition in the first statement is not always true. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park."
