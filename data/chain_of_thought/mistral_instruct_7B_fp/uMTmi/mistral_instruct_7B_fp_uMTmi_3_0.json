It means that if the premise (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, the second statement \"the book might not be a mystery novel\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. This means that while it is possible that James wrote the book, it is also possible that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James."
