            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the second statement given is \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that even though the first statement implies that Mark must buy the blue shirt if Lisa buys the red shirt, it is still possible for Mark not to buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Since the first statement does not allow for Lisa not buying the red shirt if Mark buys the blue shirt, and the second statement does not contradict the first statement, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt."
