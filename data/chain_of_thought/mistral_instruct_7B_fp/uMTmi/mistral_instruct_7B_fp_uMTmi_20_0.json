It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the second statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement. This means that the condition (the apple being red) is still possible, even if the consequence (the banana being yellow) is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the apple was not red."
