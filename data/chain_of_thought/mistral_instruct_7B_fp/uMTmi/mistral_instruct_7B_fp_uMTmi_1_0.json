The first statement only tells us that if Mary is present, then Sue will be as well. The second statement only tells us that Sue might not be present, but it does not tell us anything about Mary.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
