It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, the second part of the statement \"Also, the muffins might not have been blueberry\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the first part. This means that the cake could still be chocolate, but the muffins might not have been blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate."
