However, the statement also mentions that \"the truck might not have been metal.\" This means that even though the first part of the conditional statement might be true (the doll being plastic), the second part is not necessarily true (the truck not being metal). Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on this information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic."
