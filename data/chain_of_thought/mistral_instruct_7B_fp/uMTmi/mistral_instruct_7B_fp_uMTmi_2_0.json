            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the first condition (griffin in the forest) is true, then the second condition (unicorn in the forest) must also be true. However, the second statement \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the first conditional statement. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that the griffin was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest."
