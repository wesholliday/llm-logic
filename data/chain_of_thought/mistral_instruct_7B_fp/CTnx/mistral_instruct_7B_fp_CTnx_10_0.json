To infer the opposite, we would need a conditional statement in the form of 'If not Q, then P'. However, the given statement does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
