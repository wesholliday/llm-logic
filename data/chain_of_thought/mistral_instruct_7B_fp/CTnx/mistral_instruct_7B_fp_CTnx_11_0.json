In this case, the given statement is 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed'. Its contrapositive is 'If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed'.\n\nHowever, the original statement and its contrapositive are not equivalent to 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed'. The original statement and its contrapositive are both negations of each other, but they do not necessarily mean that 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' is true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' from 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed'."
