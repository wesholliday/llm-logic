            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'the smonk was vreebled' and Q is 'the smonk did not plagged'. This statement means that if the smonk was vreebled, then it did not plagged.\n\nNow, to infer 'If P, then not-Q' from 'If P, then not-Q', we need to understand the structure of the original statement. The original statement is a denial of Q when P is true. So, if we want to infer 'If P, then not-Q', we need to find a situation where P is true and not-Q is also true.\n\nIn the given statement, P is 'the smonk was vreebled' and not-Q is 'the smonk plagged'. The statement tells us that when P is true, not-Q is also true. However, it does not provide us with enough information to infer that when not-P (i.e., 'the smonk did not vreeble') is true, then Q (i.e., 'the smonk plagged') is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled' from 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
