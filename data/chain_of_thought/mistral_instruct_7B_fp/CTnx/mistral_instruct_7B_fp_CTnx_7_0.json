            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a contrapositive of another statement. In logic, a contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". In this case, the given statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\". The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nHowever, the statement you've asked to infer is not the contrapositive of the given statement, but rather the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If Q then P\". In this case, the statement you've asked to infer is \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can infer this statement from the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is a biconditional statement, which means it can be broken down into two conditional statements: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" and \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nThe statement you've asked to infer is \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\". This statement is not logically equivalent to any of the conditional statements in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer this statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' from 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink'."
