            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then not Q', where P is 'the fribble was snurgled' and Q is 'the fribble did not crink'. This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it did not crink.\n\nNow, to infer 'If P' is not true, then Q is true', we need to reverse the given statement. So, the statement we want to infer is 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nTo check if this inference is valid, we need to see if it follows the same logical structure as the given statement. If it does, then the inference is valid.\n\nLet's break it down:\nThe inferred statement is 'If P, then not Q', where P is 'the fribble crink' and Q is 'the fribble was snurgled'.\n\nIf we compare this with the given statement, we can see that they have the same logical structure. So, if the fribble crink, then it was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
