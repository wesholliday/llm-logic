This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\n\nNow, to infer a new conditional statement 'If P', then 'not Q', we need to consider the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn' is 'If it did surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
