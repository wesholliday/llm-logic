            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a contrapositive of the original statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then interchanging them. So, the contrapositive of 'If P (the sprocket was cranked), then Q (the sprocket was not daggled)' is 'If not Q (the sprocket was daggled), then not P (the sprocket was not cranked)'.\n\nHowever, the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value. In this case, the original statement is a contradiction, which means it is always false. Therefore, its contrapositive is also always false.\n\nSo, while we can form the contrapositive of the given statement, we cannot infer that 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' is a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled'."
