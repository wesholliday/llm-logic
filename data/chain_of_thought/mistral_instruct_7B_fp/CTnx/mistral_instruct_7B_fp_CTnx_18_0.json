            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a contrapositive of another statement. A contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In the given statement, 'P' is 'the shank was plooked' and 'Q' is 'the shank was not nugged'.\n\nNow, to form the contrapositive of 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked', we need to swap 'P' and 'Q'. So, the contrapositive statement is 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged'.\n\nHowever, this is not the same as 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' in reverse. The reverse of 'If P then Q' is 'If Q then P', which is not the same as the contrapositive.\n\nSo, we cannot infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
