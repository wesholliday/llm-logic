This means that if the condition P (the glip was slogged) is true, then the consequence Q (the glip was tragged) is false.\n\nHowever, to infer 'If Q, then not P' from this statement, we would need a different kind of conditional statement, specifically 'If not P, then Q'. This means that if the condition not P (the glip was not slogged) is true, then the consequence Q (the glip was tragged) is true.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide this kind of conditional relationship, we cannot infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged' from it.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
