In this case, 'P' is 'the flugel was blimmed' and 'Q' is 'the flugel was not zargled'.\n\nThe given statement 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled' is a contrapositive of 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed' because they have the same logical structure and mean the same thing.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, we can infer 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'."
