This means that if the splat was morphed, then it did not quank.\n\nNow, to infer 'If Q, then P' from this, we would need to have a contrapositive relationship. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. However, the given statement does not provide us with 'not Q' (the splat quanked). Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
