This statement means that if the smip was shripped, then it did not lup the zoint.\n\nNow, to infer 'If P', then 'not Q', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint' is 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
