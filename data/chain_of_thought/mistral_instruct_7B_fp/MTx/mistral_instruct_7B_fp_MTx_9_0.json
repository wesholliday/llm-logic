However, the second premise states that the twonk is not varnished.\n\nSince the twonk is not varnished, and the first premise states that if it is plinked, then it must be varnished, it follows that the twonk was not plinked. This is because the condition for varnishing (being plinked) has not been met.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
