However, the second statement tells us that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the flugel was blimmed. If it was, then according to the first statement, it should also be zargled. But we know from the second statement that it's not zargled. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'the flugel was blimmed' and 'the flugel was not zargled' at the same time, given the information provided.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to infer that the flugel was not blimmed, as this avoids the contradiction.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
