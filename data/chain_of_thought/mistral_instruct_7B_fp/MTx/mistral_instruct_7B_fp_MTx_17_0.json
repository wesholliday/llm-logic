A contradiction occurs when two statements cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated. The second premise states that the flob did not movated.\n\nSince the flob did not movate, and the first premise tells us that movation is a necessary consequence of skizzling, it follows that the flob was not skizzled. This is because if the flob had been skizzled, it would have movated, but it did not movate, so it must not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
