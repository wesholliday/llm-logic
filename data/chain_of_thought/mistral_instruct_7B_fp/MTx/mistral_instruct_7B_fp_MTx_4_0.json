            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the fribble is snurgled, then it will crink. The second statement 'The fribble did not crink' tells us that the fribble did not crinkle.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the fribble was snurgled. According to the first statement, if the fribble was snurgled, it should have crinkled. But we know from the second statement that the fribble did not crinkle. This creates a contradiction, as the fribble should have crinkled if it was snurgled, but it did not.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the fribble was not snurgled, as if it was, it would have resulted in a contradiction with the second statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
