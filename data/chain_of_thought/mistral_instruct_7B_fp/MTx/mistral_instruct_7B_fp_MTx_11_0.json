However, the second statement tells us that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditional statement again. If the flug is blummed, then it must also be zimmed. But we know that the flug is not zimmed. This means that the flug cannot be blummed, because if it were, it would have to be zimmed as well, but we know it's not.\n\nAnswer:\nYes. Based on the given statements, we can infer that the flug was not blummed."
