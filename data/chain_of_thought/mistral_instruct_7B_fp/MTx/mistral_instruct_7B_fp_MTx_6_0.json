            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement, meaning if the grommet was sploffed, then it would follow that the grommet plopped the frink. The second statement 'The grommet did not plop the frink' is a negation of the second part of the first statement.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' from these two statements. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement negates the consequence, but it does not necessarily negate the condition. It is possible that the grommet was sploffed but for some reason, it did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' based on the given information."
