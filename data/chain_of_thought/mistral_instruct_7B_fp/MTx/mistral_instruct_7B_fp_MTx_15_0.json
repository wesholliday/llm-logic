However, the second premise states that the consequence (the dreb was spened) is not true.\n\nSince the consequence is not true, it follows that the condition (the dreb was vroombed) cannot be true either, because the conditional statement states that if the condition is true, then the consequence must be true.\n\nTherefore, 'The dreb was not vroombed' is a logical consequence of the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
