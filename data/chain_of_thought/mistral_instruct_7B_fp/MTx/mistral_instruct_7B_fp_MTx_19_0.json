However, the second premise states that the smonk did not plag.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled. The fact that the smonk did not plag does not necessarily mean that it was not vreebled, as the conditional statement only states that if it was vreebled, then it would plag. It does not say that if it was not vreebled, then it would not plag. Therefore, it is possible that the smonk was vreebled but for some reason did not plag.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
