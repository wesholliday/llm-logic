It means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled as well. However, the second statement 'The wug was not garpled' contradicts the first statement. If the wug was not garpled, then it cannot be true that 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'. This means that the wug was not sproinged either, as sproinging the wug would have led to garpling it.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
