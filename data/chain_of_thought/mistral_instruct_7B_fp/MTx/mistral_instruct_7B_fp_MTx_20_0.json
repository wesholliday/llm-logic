The second statement 'The fleeg did not surn' tells us that the fleeg did not surn under any circumstances.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the fleeg was bluttered. If it was, then according to the first statement, it would surn. But we know from the second statement that it did not surn. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'it surned' and 'it did not surn' be true at the same time.\n\nSince we cannot have a contradiction, it means that the assumption that the fleeg was bluttered must be false. Therefore, 'The fleeg was not bluttered' is a possible conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
