            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given two statements are 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' and 'The splat did not quank'.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat is morphed, then it quanks.\n\nThe second statement is a simple negation, which means that the splat does not quank.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the splat is not in the state where it would quank, which is the consequence of being morphed. However, we cannot directly infer that the splat was not morphed based on these two statements alone. The reason is that the first statement is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that the splat is always morphed when it quanks. It only means that if the splat is morphed, then it quanks. Therefore, it is possible that the splat was in a state where it could quank, but it was not morphed at that time.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' based on the given statements."
