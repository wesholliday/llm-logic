The second statement 'The whiffle did not tink' tells us that the whiffle did not make the tink sound.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the whiffle was shanked. If it was, then it should have tinked according to the first statement. But we know from the second statement that it did not tink. This creates a contradiction, as the whiffle cannot both be shanked and not tink at the same time, given the information provided.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to infer that the whiffle was not shanked, as the only other option (it was shanked and tinked) leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
