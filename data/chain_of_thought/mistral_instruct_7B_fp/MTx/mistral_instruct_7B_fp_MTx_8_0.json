The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true. However, the second premise states that the consequence is not true (the sprocket was not daggled).\n\nNow, we need to determine if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is also false. If the condition is false, then the consequence cannot be true, but it does not necessarily mean that the condition cannot be true. In other words, the fact that the consequence is false does not necessarily mean that the condition is false.\n\nHowever, in this case, the conditional statement is a material implication, which means that if the condition is false, then the consequence must be false as well. Therefore, if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nSo, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: yes."
