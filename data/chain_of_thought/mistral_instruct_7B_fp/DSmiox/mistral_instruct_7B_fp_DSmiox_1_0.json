The second statement 'Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled' implies that the flugel must be either blimmed or zargled, and there is no other option. However, this statement also contains the word 'or', which means that if one option is not true, then the other must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the flugel might not be zargled, it means that the flugel cannot be zargled according to the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
