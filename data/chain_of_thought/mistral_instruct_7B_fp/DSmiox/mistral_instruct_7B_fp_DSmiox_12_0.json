The second statement 'Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped' means that the smip can either be in a state of 'shripped' or it must be in a state of 'lupped'. However, it does not specify that if the smip is not 'lupped', then it must be 'shripped'. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The smip is shripped'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
