The second statement 'Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed' means that the flug can be in one of two states: either it is blummed or it must be zimmed. However, this statement also implies that if the flug is not blummed, then it must be zimmed.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine whether the flug is blummed or not, we cannot infer 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
