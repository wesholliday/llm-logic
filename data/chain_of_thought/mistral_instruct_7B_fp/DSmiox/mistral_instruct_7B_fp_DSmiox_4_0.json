The second statement 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked' implies that the fribble can be in one of two states: either it is 'snurgled' or it is 'crinked'. However, it does not necessarily mean that the fribble is currently in the 'snurgled' state. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
