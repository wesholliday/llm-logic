The first statement suggests that the wug might not be in the state of being 'bimmed', but it does not necessarily mean that the wug is 'flooped'. The second statement gives two alternatives: either the wug is 'flooped' or it must be 'bimmed'. Since we cannot infer from the first statement that the wug is 'bimmed', the only other option left is 'flooped'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
