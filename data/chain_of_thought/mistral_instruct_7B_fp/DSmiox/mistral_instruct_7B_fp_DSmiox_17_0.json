The second statement 'Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated' implies that if the flob is not movable (the 'must be movated' part), then it must be in a state of 'skizzled'. However, since the first statement suggests that the flob might not be movable, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not movable, we cannot infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
