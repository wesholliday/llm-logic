The second statement 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned' means that the fleeg must be either bluttered or surned, but not both at the same time. Since the first statement already suggests that the fleeg might not be bluttered, it is not possible to infer that the fleeg is bluttered based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
