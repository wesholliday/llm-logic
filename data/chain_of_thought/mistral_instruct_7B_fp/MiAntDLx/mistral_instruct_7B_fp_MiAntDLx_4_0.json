To infer 'The gribble might be at quorple flimble' from this, we would need some additional information or context that limits the possibility to just quorple flimble. Without such information, we cannot make this inference based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The gribble might be at quorple flimble' from 'The gribble might be at quorple flimble or grooble'."
