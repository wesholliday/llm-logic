However, this statement does not exclude the possibility that the wozzle might be shimble alone. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that 'The wozzle might be shimble' is a fact based on this statement alone, it is not necessarily false either.\n\nAnswer:\nWhile we cannot definitively say 'yes' based on this statement alone, it is not a contradiction to say 'The wozzle might be shimble'. Therefore, the answer is 'yes', but with the caveat that this is an inference and not a fact based on the given statement."
