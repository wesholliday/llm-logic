            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The wozzle might be quorple on zazzle or wump for wump wumble' contains two possibilities for the location of 'The wozzle being quorple'. The first possibility is 'The wozzle might be quorple on zazzle', and the second is 'The wozzle might be quorple for wump wumble'. However, the 'for' in the second possibility suggests that 'wump for wump wumble' is a different location or context, not just another way of saying 'on zazzle'. Therefore, while the sentence does not explicitly rule out 'The wozzle might be quorple on zazzle', it also does not provide sufficient evidence to support it as a definitive fact.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The wozzle might be quorple on zazzle' from the given sentence."
