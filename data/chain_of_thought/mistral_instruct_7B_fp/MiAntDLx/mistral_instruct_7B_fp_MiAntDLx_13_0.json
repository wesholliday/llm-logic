However, this statement does not exclude the possibility that the wozzle might be in zooble alone. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that 'The wozzle might be in zooble', we cannot also rule it out based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wozzle might be in zooble' from 'The wozzle might be in zooble or gribble', but we also cannot definitively say that it is not."
