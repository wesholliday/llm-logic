Here, 'or' is used as a connector between two possibilities. If we want to infer 'The blurble might be blimple by zizz', we can do so because the sentence implies that the blurble could become a blimple through some means, and 'zizz' is one of those means mentioned in the sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
