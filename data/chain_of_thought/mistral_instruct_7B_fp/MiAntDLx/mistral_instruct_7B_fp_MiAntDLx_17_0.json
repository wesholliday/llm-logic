However, this statement does not exclude the possibility that the flibbit could be just snizzle. Therefore, based on this information, we cannot definitively say 'no', but we also cannot say 'yes' that 'The flibbit might be snizzle' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flibbit might be snizzle' from 'The flibbit might be snizzle or snorkel'. However, this does not mean that it is impossible for the flibbit to be just snizzle."
