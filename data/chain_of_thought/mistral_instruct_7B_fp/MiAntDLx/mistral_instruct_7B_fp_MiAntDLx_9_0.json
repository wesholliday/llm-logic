However, it does not exclude the possibility that the quank might be just flonk. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say 'no', but we also cannot say 'yes' with certainty.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The quank might be flonk' from 'The quank might be flonk or on flim' with the information provided. However, it does not mean that it is not possible. It just means that the sentence does not provide enough information to make that inference."
