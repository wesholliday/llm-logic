The second statement 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet' means that the umbrella is either in the car or still in its usual place in the closet.\n\nSince we know that the umbrella is not in its usual place in the closet, it cannot be the case that 'it is tucked away in the closet'. Therefore, the only remaining option is 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
