The second statement 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack' gives us two possibilities for the scarf's location. Since we know that the scarf is not on the coat rack, it must be in the other place mentioned, which is 'stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
