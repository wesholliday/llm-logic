This does not necessarily mean that the book is not on the table at all, but only that it is not resting on it.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' means that the book is either in one of two states: it is either on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n\nHowever, since we know that the book is not resting on the table, this means that the book must be on the shelf, as the only other option given in the second statement is not applicable.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
