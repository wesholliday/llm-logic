The second statement 'Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door' gives us two possible locations for the shoes.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not provide any information that would allow us to infer that the shoes are in the closet. The statement only tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door, not that they are in the closet.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The shoes are in the closet' based on the given information."
