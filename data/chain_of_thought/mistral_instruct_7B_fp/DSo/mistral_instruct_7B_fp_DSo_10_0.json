The second statement 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed' gives us two possibilities for the location of the missing sock. Since we know that it's not under the bed from the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
