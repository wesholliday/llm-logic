'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk'\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning it presents two mutually exclusive alternatives. In this case, the pen is either in the bag or on the desk.\n\nHowever, the first statement contradicts the second statement. If the pen isn't on the desk, then it cannot be on the desk as per the second statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the second alternative in the disjunction: 'The pen is in my bag'. Since the pen isn't on the desk, it must be in the bag, as per the second statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The pen is in my bag'."
