The second statement 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist' gives us two possibilities for the watch's location.\n\nHowever, the first statement contradicts the second statement's first possibility 'it is on his wrist'. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is 'The watch is charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
