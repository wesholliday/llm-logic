This could mean that the milk is on the counter or it is somewhere else in the room, but we cannot determine its exact location from this statement alone.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge' is a disjunctive statement that means one or the other (but not both) of the conditions must be true. However, we already know that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, so this statement does not provide any new information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The milk is on the counter' with certainty.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
