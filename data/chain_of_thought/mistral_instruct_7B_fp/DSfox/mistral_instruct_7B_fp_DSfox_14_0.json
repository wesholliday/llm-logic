The second statement 'Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked' suggests that the clug can be in one of two states: either it is snugged (properly fitted or secured) or it is fleeked (whatever 'fleeked' means in this context). Since we know that the clug is not snugged, it cannot be inferred that it is fleeked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
