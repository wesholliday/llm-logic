The second sentence 'Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered' means that the fleeg is either dirty or it is blotted (with something like ink or paint).\n\nSince we know that the fleeg is not dirty, the only other option is that it is blotted. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' directly from the given information, but we can infer that it is either dirty or blotted, and since it's not dirty, it must be blotted.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot directly infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from the given information. However, we can infer that 'The fleeg is blotted' is a possible state."
