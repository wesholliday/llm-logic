The first statement only tells us that the shank is not 'nugged', but it does not tell us anything about its 'plooked' state. The second statement tells us that the shank is either 'nugged' or 'plooked', but it does not tell us which one it is. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive statement about the 'plooked' state of the shank based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
