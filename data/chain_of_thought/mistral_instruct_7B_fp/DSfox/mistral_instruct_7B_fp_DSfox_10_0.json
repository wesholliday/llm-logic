From this, we can infer that the wug is not garpled, but we cannot directly infer that it is sproinged. The second statement is an either-or statement, which means that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged. However, without any additional information, we cannot definitively say that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The wug is sproinged' based on the given information."
