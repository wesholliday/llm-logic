The second statement 'Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged' means that the glip is either in a state of 'tragged' or 'slogged', but not in both states at the same time.\nSince we know that the glip is not 'tragged', and the only other option given is 'slogged', we cannot infer that the glip is 'tragged'. However, we can infer that the glip is 'slogged' because the first statement rules out the possibility of the glip being 'tragged', and the second statement tells us that if the glip is not 'tragged', then it must be 'slogged'.\nAnswer:\nYes."
