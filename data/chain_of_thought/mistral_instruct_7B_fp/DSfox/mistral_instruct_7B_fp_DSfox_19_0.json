The second statement 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled' means that the smonk either has the condition 'plagged' or it has another condition called 'vreebled'.\n\nSince we know that the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining option is that the smonk is vreebled. However, the statement 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled' does not necessarily mean that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled. It only means that one of the two conditions must apply.\n\nTherefore, while it is possible that the smonk is vreebled, we cannot infer this from the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
