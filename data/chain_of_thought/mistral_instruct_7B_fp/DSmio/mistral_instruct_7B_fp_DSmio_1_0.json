            "content": "Explanation:\nThe statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. On the other hand, 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' means that Fido must be either inside the house or in the garden, and there is no other option. Since 'Fido might not be in the garden' contradicts the second statement, it means that Fido must be inside the house.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' based on the given information. The first statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not provide enough information to conclude that Fido is inside the house. The second statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' only tells us that Fido must be in one of the two places, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive statement about Fido's location based on this information."
