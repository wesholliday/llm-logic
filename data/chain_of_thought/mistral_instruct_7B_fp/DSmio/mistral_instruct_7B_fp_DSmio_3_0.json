However, this statement does not provide any information about the current location of the keys. It only tells us that if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer. But it does not mean that the keys are currently in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The keys are in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
