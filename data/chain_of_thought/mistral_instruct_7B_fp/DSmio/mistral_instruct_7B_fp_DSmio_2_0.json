            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The book might not be resting on the table' means that the book could be in any location other than resting on the table, including being on the shelf.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' is a disjunctive statement, meaning it has two possible outcomes. The 'or' in this statement is inclusive, meaning both possibilities can be true at the same time (which is not the case here), or one of the possibilities can be true and the other cannot. In this case, the second statement is saying that the book must either be on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nHowever, since the first statement already tells us that the book might not be resting on the table, it means that the book cannot be resting on the table according to the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
