            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The watch might not be on his wrist' suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not currently being worn by the person. The second statement 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist' means that the watch can only be in two places: either it's being charged on the dresser or it's being worn on the person's wrist. Since the first statement tells us that the watch might not be on his wrist, it implies that the watch is not in the second place mentioned in the second statement, which is being worn on the wrist. Therefore, the watch must be in the first place mentioned in the second statement, which is being charged on the dresser.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
