            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet' suggests that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. The second statement 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' gives us two possibilities: the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet. Since the first statement tells us that the jacket might not be in the closet, it means that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet according to the first statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
