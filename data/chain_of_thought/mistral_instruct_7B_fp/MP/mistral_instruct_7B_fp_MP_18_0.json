To infer 'The truck was metal', we need to apply the given conditional statement.\n\nThe conditional statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' means that whenever the doll is plastic, the truck is metal. In this case, the doll is indeed plastic (as stated in the second premise). Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the truck should be metal.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
