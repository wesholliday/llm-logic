It means that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris also finishes the race. The second statement 'Alex finished the race' is a fact that Alex has indeed finished the race.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, it means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finishing the race) is also true. Since we know that the condition is true (from the second statement), we can infer that the consequence is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
