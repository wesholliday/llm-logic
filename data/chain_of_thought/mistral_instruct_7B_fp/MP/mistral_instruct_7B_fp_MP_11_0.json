            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given information is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' and 'The cake was chocolate'.\n\nTo infer if 'The muffins were blueberry', we need to check if the given conditions are met. The first condition is 'The cake was chocolate', which is given in the second statement. The second condition is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. Since the first condition is true (the cake is chocolate), we can check if the second condition implies that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.\n\nExplanation for 'Answer':\nSince the first condition is true (the cake is chocolate), and the second condition states that 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry', we can infer that the muffins are blueberry. This is because the 'if-then' statement is a conditional statement that, when the condition is true, implies that the consequence is also true. In this case, the consequence is 'The muffins were blueberry'. Therefore, we can infer that 'The muffins were blueberry'."
