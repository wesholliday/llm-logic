The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf being in the den) must also be true. The second premise states that the condition is indeed true (the bear is in the cave). Therefore, based on the principles of logical reasoning, we can infer that the consequence (the wolf being in the den) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
