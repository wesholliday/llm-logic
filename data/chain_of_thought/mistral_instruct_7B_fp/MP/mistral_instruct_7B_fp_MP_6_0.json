This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue chose pizza'. This statement tells us that Sue did indeed choose pizza.\n\nNow, we can use the information from both statements to make an inference. Since the first statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, and we know that Sue did choose pizza, then according to the conditional statement, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
