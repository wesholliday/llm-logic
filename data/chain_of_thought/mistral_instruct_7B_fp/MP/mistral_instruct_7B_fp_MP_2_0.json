This means that if the griffin is in the forest, then it follows that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nThe second statement is an assertion: 'The griffin was in the forest'. This means that the griffin is actually present in the forest.\n\nNow, to infer whether the unicorn is also in the forest, we can use the first statement as a rule and the second statement as evidence. Since the second statement tells us that the griffin is in the forest, and the first statement tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest, it follows that the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
