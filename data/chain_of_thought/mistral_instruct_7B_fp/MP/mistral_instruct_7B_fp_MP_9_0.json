It means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. The second statement 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is a fact.\n\nTo infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to check if the fact 'Lisa bought the red shirt' satisfies the condition in the first statement. If it does, then we can infer that 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nSo, let's check:\n- Lisa bought the red shirt (fact)\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (condition)\n\nSince the fact 'Lisa bought the red shirt' satisfies the condition, we can infer that 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
