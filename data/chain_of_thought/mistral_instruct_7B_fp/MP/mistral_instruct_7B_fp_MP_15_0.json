The second statement 'Sam took a plane' is a fact that Sam indeed took a plane.\n\nTo infer whether Erin took a train based on these two statements, we need to consider the conditional relationship between Sam and Erin's modes of transportation. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, it implies that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, according to the conditional statement, Erin should also have taken a train. Therefore, we can infer that 'Erin took a train'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
