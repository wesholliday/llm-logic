            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This means that whenever Tom watches football, Jen also watches basketball. The second statement is 'Tom watched football'. This statement tells us that Tom did watch football, but it does not necessarily mean that Jen also watched basketball. The 'if' statement only tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. It does not guarantee that Jen watches basketball when Tom watches football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Jen watched basketball' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
