The conditional statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' means that whenever the condition (the car being red) is true, the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true.\n\nGiven that the condition (the car being red) is true (as stated in the second premise), we can infer that the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
