This means that if the book is written by James, then it follows that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The book was written by James'. This statement tells us that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is true (the book was written by James), and the first statement tells us that if the condition is true, then the book is a mystery novel, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
