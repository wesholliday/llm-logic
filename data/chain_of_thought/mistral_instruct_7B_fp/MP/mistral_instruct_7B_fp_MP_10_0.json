This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true. The second statement is 'The dog was inside'. This means that the condition in the first statement is true. Therefore, according to the logic of the conditional statement, the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
