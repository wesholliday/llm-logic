This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Joe went to the park'. This statement tells us that Joe did indeed go to the park.\n\nNow, we can use the information from both statements to make an inference. Since the first statement tells us that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo, and we know that Joe went to the park (second statement), then according to the first statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
