The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. The second statement confirms that the shirt is indeed cotton.\n\nSince the shirt being cotton is a necessary condition for the pants to be denim (according to the first statement), and we know that the shirt is cotton, it follows logically that the pants must also be denim.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
