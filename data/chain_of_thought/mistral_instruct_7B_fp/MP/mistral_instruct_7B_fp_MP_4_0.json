To infer whether 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true or false, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true. The second premise states that the condition is indeed true (the alien visited Mars).\n\nHowever, the second premise does not guarantee that the consequence is also true. In other words, just because the alien visited Mars, it does not necessarily mean that the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The robot visited Jupiter' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
