This means that the concert could be postponed, but it does not necessarily mean that it will be postponed. Therefore, while it is possible that the concert might be postponed, we cannot infer with certainty that it will be postponed based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The concert might be postponed' with certainty based on the given information."
