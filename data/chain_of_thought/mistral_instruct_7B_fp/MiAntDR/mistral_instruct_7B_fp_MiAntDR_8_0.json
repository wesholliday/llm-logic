Since the second possibility is already included in the first statement, it is not necessary to infer it separately. However, if we interpret the question as asking if we can draw a stronger conclusion than what is already stated, then the answer would be 'no'. The statement does not provide enough information to infer that the restaurant is definitely open for limited hours on any other day of the week.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the information given, it is not necessary to infer 'The restaurant might be open for limited hours'. However, if we interpret the question as asking if we can draw a stronger conclusion than what is already stated, then the answer would be 'no'."
