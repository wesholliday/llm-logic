The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' means that if Tom watches football, then Jen must also watch basketball.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
