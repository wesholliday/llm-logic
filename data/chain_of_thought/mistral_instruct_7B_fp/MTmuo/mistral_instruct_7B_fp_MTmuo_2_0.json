The second statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, this statement does not mean that the griffin is actually in the forest.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'. The first statement does not rule out the possibility of the griffin being in the forest, and the second statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
