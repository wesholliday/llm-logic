The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' means that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding.\nHowever, these two statements do not provide enough information to infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that Sue does not have to be at the wedding, and the second statement tells us that if Mary is there, then Sue will also be there. It does not tell us that Mary is not there.\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' based on the given information."
