This does not mean that she definitely did not play tennis, but it also does not mean that she must have played tennis.\n\nThe second statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis' is a conditional statement. It means that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy must play tennis. This does not mean that Jeff plays basketball, but it does mean that if he does, then Amy will play tennis.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer 'Jeff did not play basketball'. The first statement does not rule out the possibility that Jeff plays basketball, and the second statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
