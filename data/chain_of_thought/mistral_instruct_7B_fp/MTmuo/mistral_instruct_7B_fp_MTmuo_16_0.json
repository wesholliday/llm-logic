This means that the pants could be any material other than denim.\n2. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from these statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from these statements.\n\nHere's why:\nThe first statement tells us that the pants are not necessarily denim, but it does not tell us anything about the shirt. The second statement tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not tell us anything about the actual material of the shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt is not cotton based on these statements."
