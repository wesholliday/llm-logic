'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' - This statement means that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel. It could be any other genre.\n2. 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' - This conditional statement means that if James wrote the book, then the book would be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from these two statements.\n\nTo infer 'The book was not written by James', we would need to have evidence that contradicts the 'if' part of the second statement. However, the second statement only tells us that if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel. It does not tell us that James actually wrote the book.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, it does not contradict the 'if' part of the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
