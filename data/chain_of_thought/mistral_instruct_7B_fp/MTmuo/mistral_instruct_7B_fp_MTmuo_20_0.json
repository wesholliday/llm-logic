The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, this statement does not mean that the apple is red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
