The second statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race' means that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris also finishes the race. However, this does not mean that Alex has finished the race. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Alex did not finish the race' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
