The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' means that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then it is a certainty that Mark buys the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
