This is a conditional statement, and it does not mean that Sam actually took a plane.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'Sam did not take a plane'. The first statement does not rule out the possibility that Erin took a train, and the second statement only tells us what would happen if Sam took a plane, not that he actually did.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
