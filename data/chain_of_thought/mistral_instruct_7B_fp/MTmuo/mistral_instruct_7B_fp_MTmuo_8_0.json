It means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also have been awake.\n\nHowever, the fact that the mummy was not awake (as stated in the first statement) does not necessarily mean that the vampire was also not awake. The conditional statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also have to be awake. It does not tell us that the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
