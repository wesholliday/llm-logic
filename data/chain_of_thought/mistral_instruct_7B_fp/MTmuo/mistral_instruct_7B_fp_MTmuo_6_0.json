In other words, Bob could have chosen something other than pasta.\n\nThe second statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' is a conditional statement. It means that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must choose pasta.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements provides any information about what Sue actually chose. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
