            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue' means that the truck could have been any color other than blue. The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement, which means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this statement does not mean that the car is red.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements. The first statement does not rule out the possibility that the truck is blue when the car is red. The second statement only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. It does not tell us anything about the actual colors of the car and the truck."
