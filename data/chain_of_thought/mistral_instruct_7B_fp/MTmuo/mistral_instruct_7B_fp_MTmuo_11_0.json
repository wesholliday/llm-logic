The second statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, this statement does not mean that the cake is necessarily chocolate.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The cake was not chocolate'. The information does not provide enough evidence to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
