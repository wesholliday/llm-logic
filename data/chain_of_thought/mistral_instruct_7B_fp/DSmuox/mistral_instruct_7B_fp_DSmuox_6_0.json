'Sploffed' is not defined in the context, so we can assume it's a new state for the grommet.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The grommet is sploffed' because the first statement does not rule out the possibility of the grommet being plopped. The second statement only tells us that the grommet can be in one of the two states, but it does not specify which state it is in.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The grommet is sploffed' based on the given information."
