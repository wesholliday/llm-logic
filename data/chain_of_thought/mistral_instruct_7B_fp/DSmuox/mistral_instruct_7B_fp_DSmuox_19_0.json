The second statement 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged' means that the smonk must either be vreebled or it is necessarily plagged.\n\nHowever, the two statements do not provide enough information to infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'. The second statement only tells us that the smonk must be either vreebled or plagged, but it does not rule out the possibility that the smonk is plagged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smonk is vreebled based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
