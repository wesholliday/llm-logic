The second statement 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened' means that the dreb can either be vroombed (whatever that means in this context) or it must be spent.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about whether the dreb has actually been vroombed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
