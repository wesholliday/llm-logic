The second statement 'Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated' means that the flob can be in one of two states: either it is skizzled or it must be moved. However, the statement does not specify that if the flob is not required to be moved (as stated in the first statement), then it must be skizzled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
