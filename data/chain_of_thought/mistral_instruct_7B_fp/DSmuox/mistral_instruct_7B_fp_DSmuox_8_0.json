The second statement 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled' means that the sprocket can be in one of two states: either it is cranked or it must be daggled (but it is not currently in the daggled state). Since the sprocket is not in the daggled state, it must be in the cranked state.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
