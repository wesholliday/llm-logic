This does not necessarily mean that the splat is morphed, but it does leave open the possibility that the splat could be morphed.\n\nThe second statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that the splat is not required to be quanked (from the first statement), the only remaining option is that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
