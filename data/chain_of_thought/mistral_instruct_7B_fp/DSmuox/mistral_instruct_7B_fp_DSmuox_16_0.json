The second statement 'Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted' means that the sneg can be in one of two states: either it is crampled or it must be sproted.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled. It only means that if the sneg is not in the state of being sproted, then it must be in the state of being crampled. But the first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the sneg to be sproted, so it could be in any state, including not being crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
