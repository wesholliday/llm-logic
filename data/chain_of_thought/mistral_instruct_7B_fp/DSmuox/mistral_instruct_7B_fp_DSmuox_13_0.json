The second statement 'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged' means that the glip can either be slogged or it must be tragged (meaning it is necessary for the glip to be tragged if it is not slogged).\n\nHowever, since the first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the glip to be tragged, this means that the glip can be slogged without having to be tragged. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
