The second statement 'Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked' means that there are two possibilities: either the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not imply that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished. It only states that one of the two conditions must be true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk is varnished' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
