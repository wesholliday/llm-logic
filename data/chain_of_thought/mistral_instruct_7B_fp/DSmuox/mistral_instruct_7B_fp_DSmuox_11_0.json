The second statement 'Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed' means that the flug can either be in a state of being blummed or it must be in a state of being zimmed.\n\nHowever, neither statement provides any information about the current state of the flug being blummed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flug is blummed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
