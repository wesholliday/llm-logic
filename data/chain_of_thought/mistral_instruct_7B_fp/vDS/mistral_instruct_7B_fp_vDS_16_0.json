Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'The pen is on my desk' and Q is 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if it is not possible for both the first and second premises to be true at the same time, and the conclusion follows logically from the first two premises.\n\nIn this case, the first and second premises cannot both be true because they are contradictory. If the pen is in my bag, then it cannot also be on my desk. Therefore, if the pen is not on my desk (as stated in the second premise), then it must be in my bag (as concluded in the third premise).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
