Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The remote control is on the coffee table' and Q is 'The remote control is hiding under the couch'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Since the argument is in the form of disjunctive syllogism, we can see that if the second premise 'The remote control isn't hiding under the couch' is true, then the first premise 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch' must be true, and its disjunct 'The remote control is on the coffee table' must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
