            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of syllogism, which is a type of logical reasoning that consists of two premises and a conclusion. In this case, the two premises are 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf' and 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf'. The conclusion is 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. The first premise is a disjunction, which means it states that at least one of the two alternatives is true. In this case, the two alternatives are 'The toy is in the toy box' and 'The toy is sitting on the shelf'.\n2. The second premise states that 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf'.\n3. From these two premises, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box, because the only other alternative (the toy being on the shelf) has been ruled out by the second premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, it is not possible for the conclusion to be false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
