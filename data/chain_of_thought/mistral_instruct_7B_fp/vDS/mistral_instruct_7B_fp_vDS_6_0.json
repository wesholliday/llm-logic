A disjunctive syllogism has the following structure:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The phone is in the living room' and Q is 'The phone is ringing in the kitchen'. The argument goes as follows:\n\n1. Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n2. The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n3. Therefore, The phone is in the living room.\n\nExplanation of why this is a valid form of argument:\n\nIn classical logic, a disjunctive syllogism is valid because if both P and Q are false, then not Q must be true. In this case, if the phone is not in the living room and it is not ringing in the kitchen, then the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
