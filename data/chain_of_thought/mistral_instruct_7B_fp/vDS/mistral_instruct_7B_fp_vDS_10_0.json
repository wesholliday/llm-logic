            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of syllogism, which is a type of logical reasoning that consists of two premises and a conclusion. In this case, the two premises are 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed' and 'The missing sock isn't under the bed'. The conclusion is 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, does the conclusion have to be true as well?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a disjunction, which means it states that one of two things is true. In this case, either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n2. The second premise states that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n3. From these two premises, we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket, because if it wasn't under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket (according to the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
