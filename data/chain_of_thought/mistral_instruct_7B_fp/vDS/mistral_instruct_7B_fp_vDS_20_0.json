Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'The sunglasses are in her bag' and Q is 'They are perched on her head'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nGiven the premises, 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head' and 'The sunglasses aren't perched on her head', it follows logically that the sunglasses must be in her bag. This is because the only other option, 'They are perched on her head', has been ruled out by the second premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
