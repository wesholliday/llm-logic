Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'Fido is inside' and Q is 'Fido is in the garden'.\n\nThe argument is valid if either P or Q is true, and not P is true, then Q must be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nThe first premise 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' is a disjunction, meaning either one or both of the statements are true. The second premise 'Fido is not in the garden' negates the second part of the disjunction, leaving only the first part as a possibility. Therefore, the conclusion 'Fido is inside' is a valid inference."
