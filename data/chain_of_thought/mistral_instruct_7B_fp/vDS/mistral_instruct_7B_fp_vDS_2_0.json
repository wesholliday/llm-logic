            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. In this form of argument, if we have two mutually exclusive statements A and \u00acA (the negation of A), and we know that neither A nor \u00acA is false, then the statement not-\u00acA (the negation of the negation of A) must be true. In other words, if we know that either A or \u00acA is true, and we know that \u00acA is false, then A must be true.\n\nIn this case, the two mutually exclusive statements are 'The book is on the shelf' (A) and 'The book isn't resting on the table' (\u00acA). The second premise of the argument states that \u00acA is false, which means that 'The book isn't resting on the table' is not true. Since we know that either A or \u00acA is true, and we know that \u00acA is false, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
