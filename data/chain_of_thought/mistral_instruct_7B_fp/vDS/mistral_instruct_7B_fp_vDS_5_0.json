Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The cookies are in the jar' and Q is 'The cookies are hidden in the pantry'.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In the case of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion follows logically if the premises are true and the argument form is correct.\n\nThe argument form is correct because it is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form.\n\nNow, let's check if the premises are true or false. The first premise 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry' is a statement of exhaustiveness and exclusivity, meaning that the cookies must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry, and they cannot be in both places at the same time.\n\nThe second premise 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry' tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\nSince the cookies cannot be in both the jar and the pantry at the same time, and we know that they are not in the pantry, it follows logically that they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
