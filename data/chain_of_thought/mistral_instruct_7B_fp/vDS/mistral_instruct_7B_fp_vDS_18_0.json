Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'The notebook is in the drawer' and Q is 'The notebook is sitting on the nightstand'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In a disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion follows logically if the first premise is a disjunction (P or Q), the second premise denies the first disjunct (not P), and the second disjunct (Q) is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid. The first premise is a disjunction, the second premise denies the first disjunct, and the second disjunct is the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises."
