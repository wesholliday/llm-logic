Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'The watch is charging on the dresser' and Q is 'The watch is on his wrist'. The argument goes as follows:\n\n1. Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n2. The watch isn't on his wrist.\n3. Therefore, The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nExplanation of the validity:\n\nThe validity of a disjunctive syllogism argument depends on the truth of its premises, not on the content of the premises themselves. If the first premise is true, then either P or Q must be true. If the second premise is true, then P cannot be true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Q is true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
