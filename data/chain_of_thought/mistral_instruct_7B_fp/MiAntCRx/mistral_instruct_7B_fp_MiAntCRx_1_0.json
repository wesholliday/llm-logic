However, if 'quimble' is the only property mentioned in the original statement 'The floob might be quimble', then we cannot infer that 'The floob might be quorple and quimble' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The floob might be quorple and quimble' based on 'The floob might be quimble'."
