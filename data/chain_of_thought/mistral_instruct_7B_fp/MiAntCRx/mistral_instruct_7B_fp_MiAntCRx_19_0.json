However, 'The zazzle might quibble and fizzle' is a more specific statement, implying that not only might 'zazzle' lose its effectiveness, but it might also involve some disagreements or arguments. Since the original statement does not include the possibility of disagreements or arguments, we cannot infer 'The zazzle might quibble and fizzle' from 'The zazzle might fizzle' alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
