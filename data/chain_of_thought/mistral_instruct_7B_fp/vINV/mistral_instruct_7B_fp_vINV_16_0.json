The form of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If A then B\nConclusion: If not A then not B\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. The conclusion is 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (Premise)\n2. The shirt was not cotton (Assumption for the negation of the conclusion)\n\nFrom the premise, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. But we are assuming that the shirt is not cotton. If the shirt is not cotton, then the condition in the premise does not hold. However, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from this. The conclusion is 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'. But just because the shirt is not cotton, it does not mean that the pants are not denim. The pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
