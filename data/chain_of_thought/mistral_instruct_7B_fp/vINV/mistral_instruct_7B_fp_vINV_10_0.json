            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P (the dog was inside), then Q (the cat was outside).\nConclusion: If not-P (the dog was not inside), then not-Q (the cat was not outside).\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nLet's consider two possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (P -> Q). In this case, since the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. Now, if the dog is not inside (not-P), then the cat cannot be outside (not-Q) because the premise states that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside.\n\n2. If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside (not-P -> not-Q). In this case, since the dog is not inside, the cat must not be outside because the premise states that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside.\n\nIn both scenarios, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
