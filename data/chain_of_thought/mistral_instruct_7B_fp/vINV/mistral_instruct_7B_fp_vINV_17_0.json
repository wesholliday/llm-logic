In logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to its contrapositive 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given in the question is 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad'. This is the same as the original conditional statement, not its contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
