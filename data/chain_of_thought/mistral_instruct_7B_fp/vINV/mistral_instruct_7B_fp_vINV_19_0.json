            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form is known as contrapositive logic. In logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to its contrapositive 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument is 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball'. This is the same as the original conditional statement, not its contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion does not follow logically from its premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
