In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false at the same time.\n\nLet's consider a possible scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false:\n\n1. P (Joe went to the park)\n2. Not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo)\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it is also possible that Q is true (Lucy went to the zoo). Therefore, it is not the case that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
