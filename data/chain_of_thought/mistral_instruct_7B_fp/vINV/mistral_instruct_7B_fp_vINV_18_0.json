In other words, we need to see if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. Conclusion: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the truth tables for both the conditional statement in the premise and the contrapositive statement in the conclusion:\n\n| Doll is Plastic | Truck is Metal | Doll is not Plastic | Truck is not Metal |\n|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| True            | True           | False               | True             |\n| True            | False          | False               | False            |\n| False           | True           | True               | False            |\n| False           | False          | True               | True             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the truth of the premise (conditional statement) and the truth of the conclusion (contrapositive statement) always correspond. This means that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck cannot be metal, and if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid."
