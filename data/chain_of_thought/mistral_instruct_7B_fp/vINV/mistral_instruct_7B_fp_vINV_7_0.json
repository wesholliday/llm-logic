            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a contrapositive argument. A contrapositive argument is a logical transformation of an original argument, where the original argument's conclusion and premise are swapped and their negations are applied. In other words, if the original argument is in the form 'If P, then Q', the contrapositive argument is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the contrapositive argument follows the rules of logic. In this case, the original argument is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. The contrapositive argument is 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race'.\n\nExamining the contrapositive argument, we can see that if the first condition (Alex did not finish the race) is true, then the second condition (Chris did not finish the race) must also be true. This is because if Alex did not finish the race, then by the original argument, Chris also did not finish the race. Therefore, the contrapositive argument follows the rules of logic, and the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
