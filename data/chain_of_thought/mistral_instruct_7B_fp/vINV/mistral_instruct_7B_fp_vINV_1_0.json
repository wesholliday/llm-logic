            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form can be represented as follows:\n\nIf P (Mary was at the wedding), then Q (Sue was at the wedding)\nIf not-P (Mary was not at the wedding), then not-Q (Sue was not at the wedding)\n\nThis argument is known as a contrapositive argument, which means that if the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of the premise is also true. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nHowever, the argument given is the contrapositive of the conclusion, which is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the contrapositive of the conclusion is logically equivalent to the original premise.\n\nThe original premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nThe contrapositive of the conclusion is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the conclusion is logically equivalent to the original premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
