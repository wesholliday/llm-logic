            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional argument, where the premise is a conditional statement and the conclusion is another conditional statement. The form of the argument is as follows:\n\nPremise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nConclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. The premise states that if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n2. The conclusion states that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue.\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false:\n\n1. The car is red. (Premise is true)\n2. However, the truck is not blue. (Conclusion is false)\n\nBut this scenario is not possible, because if the car is red, then by the premise, the truck must be blue. Therefore, it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid."
