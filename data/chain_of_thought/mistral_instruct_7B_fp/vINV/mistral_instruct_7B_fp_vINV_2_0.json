            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional statement, specifically a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the contrapositive of the given conditional statement is true.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nIf the griffin was not in the forest, then according to the original conditional statement, the unicorn was not in the forest as well. This means that the contrapositive is true if the original conditional statement is true.\n\nTherefore, if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest is a logically valid conclusion given that 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is a true premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
