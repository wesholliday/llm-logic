In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false at the same time.\n\nLet's consider a possible scenario:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (P implies Q)\n2. If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta (not P implies not Q)\n\nNow, let's see if it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false at the same time:\n\n1. Suppose Sue chose pizza (P is true). Then, according to the argument, Bob must have chosen pasta (Q is true).\n2. Now, suppose we change the scenario and say that Sue did not choose pizza (not P is true). According to the argument, Bob must not have chosen pasta (not Q is true).\n\nIn this scenario, the premise and the conclusion are both true. Therefore, it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false at the same time.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid."
