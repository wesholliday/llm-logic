In this case, the argument has two conditional statements, and we can test its validity by using the method of contraposition.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nLet's apply this method to our argument:\n\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nContrapositive of Premise 1: If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\nContrapositive of Premise 2: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nSince the contrapositive of Premise 1 is the same as Premise 2, the argument is logically equivalent, and it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
