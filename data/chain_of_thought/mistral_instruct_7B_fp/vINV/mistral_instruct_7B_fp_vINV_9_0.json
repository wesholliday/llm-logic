            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Conclusion: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false:\n\n1. Premise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Let's assume this is true.)\n2. Conclusion: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. (But this is false. For example, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but Mark still bought the blue shirt, then the conclusion is false.)\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
