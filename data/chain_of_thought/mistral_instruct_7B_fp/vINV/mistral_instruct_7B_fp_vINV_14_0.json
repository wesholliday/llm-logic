            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of contrapositive logic, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q', then 'not Q' implies 'not P'. In this case, 'P' is 'the bear was in the cave' and 'Q' is 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\nThe argument's structure is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q, therefore not P\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, this argument is logically valid. If the bear was not in the cave, then according to the premise, the wolf was not in the den. The conclusion 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' is a direct consequence of the premise 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'."
