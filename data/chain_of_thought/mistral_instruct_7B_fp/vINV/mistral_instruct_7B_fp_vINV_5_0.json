            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form can be represented as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nTherefore, if not P, then not Q.\n\nIn this case, P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's consider a truth table for the premise and the conclusion:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2794 Q | not P | not Q | (not P) \u2794 (not Q) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | F | F | T |\n| T | F | F | F | T | T |\n| F | T | F | T | F | T |\n| F | F | T | T | T | T |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the premise and the conclusion are always either both true or both false. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
