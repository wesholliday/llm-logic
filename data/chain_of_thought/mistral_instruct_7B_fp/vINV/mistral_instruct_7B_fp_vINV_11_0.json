            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional argument, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. In a conditional argument, the form is 'If P, then Q'. The contrapositive of this argument is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the contrapositive follows logically from the original conditional statement.\n\nThe original conditional statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'.\n\nNow, let's check if the contrapositive follows logically from the original conditional statement.\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that the existence of chocolate cake implies the existence of blueberry muffins.\n\nIf the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate. This means that the non-existence of blueberry muffins implies the non-existence of chocolate cake.\n\nSince the non-existence of blueberry muffins does not necessarily imply the non-existence of chocolate cake, the contrapositive does not follow logically from the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
