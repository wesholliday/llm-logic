Not P (vampire was not awake)\n3. Therefore, not Q (mummy was not awake)\n\nThis argument is known as a contrapositive argument, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement if the original statement is a material conditional.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, which means that if the argument is logically valid, then the contrapositive of a valid argument is also valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid."
