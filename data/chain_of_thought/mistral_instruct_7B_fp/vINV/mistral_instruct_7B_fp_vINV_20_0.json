The form of this argument is as follows:\n\nPremise: If A then B\nConclusion: If not A then not B\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of conditional logic. According to these rules, a conditional argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premise.\n\nIn this case, the argument is not logically valid. The premise 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' does not logically imply the conclusion 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo. The argument is not logically valid."
