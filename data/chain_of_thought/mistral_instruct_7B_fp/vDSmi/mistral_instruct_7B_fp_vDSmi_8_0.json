Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The remote control is on the coffee table' and Q is 'The remote control is hiding under the couch'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, the second premise 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch' does not necessarily mean that the remote control is on the coffee table. It only means that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, but it could still be somewhere else. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
