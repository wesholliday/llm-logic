Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'The watch is charging on the dresser' and Q is 'The watch is on his wrist'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, the validity of an argument does not depend on the truth of its premises or conclusion. It only depends on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nSo, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist\n3. Therefore, The watch is charging on the dresser\n\nThe argument is logically valid because if the second premise is true (i.e., the watch might not be on his wrist), then the first premise must be true (i.e., the watch is charging on the dresser). This is because the only other option in the first premise (the watch being on his wrist) has been ruled out by the second premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
