Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Fido is inside' and Q is 'Fido must be in the garden'. The first premise states that either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden. The second premise states that Fido might not be in the garden, which is equivalent to saying that Fido is not necessarily in the garden (not Q).\n\nHowever, the second premise does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside (P). It only means that Fido is not in the garden, which does not exclude the possibility that he is inside. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
