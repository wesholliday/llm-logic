Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box', and Q is 'The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, the argument is not logically valid. The reason is that the second premise 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor' does not necessarily mean that the missing piece is in the box. It only means that it is not blending in on the floor, but it could still be lost somewhere else. Therefore, the conclusion 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box' does not follow logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
