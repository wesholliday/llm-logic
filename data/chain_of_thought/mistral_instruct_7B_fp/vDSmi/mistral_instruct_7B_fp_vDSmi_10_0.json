Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' and Q is 'The missing sock is under the bed'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, the second premise 'The missing sock might not be under the bed' does not necessarily mean that the missing sock is not under the bed. It only means that it is possible that the missing sock is not under the bed. But this does not rule out the possibility that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, which is the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
