Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The cat is napping on the couch' and Q is 'The cat is playing in the bedroom'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, the validity of the argument does not depend on the truth of the premises or the conclusion. It only depends on the logical structure of the argument.\n\nSo, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the logical structure follows the rules of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid. If the cat is not playing in the bedroom (not Q), then it must be napping on the couch (P). This is a valid form of argument according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism. However, the truth of the premises and the conclusion is not being evaluated here."
