A disjunctive syllogism has the following structure:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' (P or Q), the second premise is 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' (not P), and the conclusion is 'The sunglasses are in her bag' (Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a valid disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid as long as the premises are true. However, to determine if the premises are true, we would need more information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAssuming the premises are true, then yes, the argument is logically valid."
