Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The cookies are in the jar', and Q is 'The cookies are hidden in the pantry'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, the validity of the argument depends on the meaning of the words used in the premises. In this case, the argument assumes that 'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' means 'It is not the case that the cookies are hidden in the pantry'. If this is not the case, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is not possible to determine the validity of the argument without more information about the meaning of the words used in the premises. Therefore, I must answer 'no' to the question of whether the argument is logically valid."
