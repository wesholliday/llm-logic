In this case, the first premise can be broken down into 'P': 'The scarf is not draped on the coat rack' and 'Q': 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'. The second premise is 'P', and the conclusion is 'Q'.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid because the first premise does not necessarily mean that the scarf is in the backpack. It only means that if the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack. But it does not rule out the possibility that the scarf is lost, hidden, or in some other location.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid."
