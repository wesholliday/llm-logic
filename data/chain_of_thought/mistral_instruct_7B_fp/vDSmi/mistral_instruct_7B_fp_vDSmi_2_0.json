Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The book is on the shelf' and Q is 'The book is resting on the table'.\n\nThe validity of a disjunctive syllogism depends on the truth of its premises and the logical structure of the argument. If both premises are true, or if one premise is true and the other is false, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, the validity of the argument does not depend on the truth of the conclusion. A valid argument is one where, if its premises are true, then its conclusion must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' - This is the disjunction, P or Q.\n2. 'The book might not be resting on the table' - This is the negation of Q, not Q.\n\nIf not Q is true, then Q must be false. Therefore, the book cannot be resting on the table. Since we are given that P or Q, and we know that Q is false, then P must be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
