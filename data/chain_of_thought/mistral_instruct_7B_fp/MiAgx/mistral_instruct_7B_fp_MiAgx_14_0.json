            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence 'The blurble might be blurble for a flump and the wumble might be snizzle' is a conditional statement, where 'might be' indicates a possibility. It suggests that the blurble could have the property of 'blurble' for a flump, and the wumble could have the property of 'snizzle'.\n\nTo infer 'It might be that the blurble is blurble for a flump and the wumble is snizzle', we are simply restating the original sentence in a different form. Since the original sentence suggests a possibility, and restating it does not change the meaning, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
