Each clause suggests a possibility, but it does not necessarily mean that they happen together or in a specific order.\n\nTo infer 'It might be that the zooble is in quimble and the plonk flimbles fribble', we need to understand that the two clauses are related and could potentially happen at the same time or in a specific order. However, the original sentence does not provide enough information to make this inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'It might be that the zooble is in quimble and the plonk flimbles fribble' based on the given sentence. The original sentence only suggests that both events are possibilities, but it does not imply that they happen together or in a specific order."
