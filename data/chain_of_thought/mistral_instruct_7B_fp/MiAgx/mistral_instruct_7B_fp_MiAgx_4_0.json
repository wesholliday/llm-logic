            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence 'From 'The flimble might be at wozzle wozzle and the gribble might be in the snork wozzle',' contains two independent clauses connected by 'and', which means they can stand alone as separate sentences. The first clause states that 'The flimble might be at wozzle wozzle', and the second clause states that 'the gribble might be in the snork wozzle'. The phrase 'from' is used to introduce a reason or explanation, but in this case, it does not change the meaning of the original sentences. Therefore, we can infer that 'It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle' is a valid inference from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
