            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence 'The blimp might be in the wozzle and the flonk might quibble plonk' is a complex sentence with two independent clauses connected by 'and'. The first clause 'The blimp might be in the wozzle' and the second clause 'the flonk might quibble plonk' both express possibilities. Since 'might' is used in both clauses, it implies that both events are not certain but possible.\n\nTo infer 'It might be that the blimp is in the wozzle and the flonk quibbles plonk', we are simply rephrasing the original sentence in a more straightforward way. Since the original sentence is expressing two possibilities, and there is no contradiction between the two, it is reasonable to infer that the rephrased sentence also holds true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
