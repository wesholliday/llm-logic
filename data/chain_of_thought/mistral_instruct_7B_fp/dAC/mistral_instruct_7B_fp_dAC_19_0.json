            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe first statement given is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Jen watched basketball'. This statement tells us that Jen did watch basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot deduce that 'Tom watched football' is true. The fact that Jen watched basketball does not automatically mean that Tom also watched football, even if the first statement suggests that they are related.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
