            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given premises are 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' and 'The truck was blue'.\n\nTo deduce 'The car was red', we need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q' and 'P' is true, then 'Q' must be true.\n\nIn this case, 'P' is 'The car was red' and 'Q' is 'The truck was blue'. The given premise 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' tells us that 'P' implies 'Q'. The second premise 'The truck was blue' tells us that 'Q' is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that 'P' (i.e., 'The car was red') is true based on these two premises alone. This is because the given premises do not provide enough information to establish that 'P' is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce 'The car was red' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
