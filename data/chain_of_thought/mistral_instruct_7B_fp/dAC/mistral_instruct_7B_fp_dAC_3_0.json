If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe second statement is an instance of the first statement's consequent (the part that follows 'then'). However, it does not necessarily mean that the first statement's antecedent (the part that comes before 'then') is true. In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, it does not mean that James wrote it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce 'The book was written by James' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' and 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
