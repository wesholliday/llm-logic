The if-then rule states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. We know that the pants are denim, so we need to check if the shirt is also cotton.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm or deny that the shirt is cotton, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
