This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. The second statement is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nNow, let's analyze this information. The second statement tells us that Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. The first statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. It does not guarantee that Joe actually went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce 'Joe went to the park' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
