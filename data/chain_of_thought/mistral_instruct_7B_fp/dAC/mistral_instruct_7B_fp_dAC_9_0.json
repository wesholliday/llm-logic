            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. This statement does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt, but it does mean that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, since we have the second statement 'Mark bought the blue shirt', we can infer that at least one of the two conditions in the first statement must be true. In other words, either Lisa bought the red shirt, or she did not buy the red shirt but Mark still bought the blue shirt.\n\nBut since we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, the only way for both conditions in the first statement to be true is if Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, we can deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
