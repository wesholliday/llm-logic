It means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nThe second statement 'The cat was outside' is a fact. It tells us that the cat is currently outside.\n\nSince we know that 'The cat was outside', and the conditional statement tells us that 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', we can infer that the dog must not be inside, because if the dog were inside, then the cat would also have to be outside, but we know that the cat is outside.\n\nHowever, the absence of the dog being inside does not necessarily mean that the dog is outside. It only means that the dog is not inside.\n\nSo, we cannot directly deduce 'The dog was inside' from the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
