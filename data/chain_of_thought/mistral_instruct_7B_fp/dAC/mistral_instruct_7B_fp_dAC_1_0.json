This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This means that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think about the conditional statement again. The statement says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, it means that according to the condition, Mary must also have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
