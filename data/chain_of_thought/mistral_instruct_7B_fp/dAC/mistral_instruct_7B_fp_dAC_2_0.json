'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' - This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (griffin in the forest) is true, then the second part (unicorn in the forest) must also be true.\n2. 'The unicorn was in the forest' - This statement is a fact, meaning that the unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information given:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest.\n2. The second statement tells us that the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nSince the second statement is a fact that the unicorn is in the forest, and the first statement tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest, we can infer that the griffin must also be in the forest.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
