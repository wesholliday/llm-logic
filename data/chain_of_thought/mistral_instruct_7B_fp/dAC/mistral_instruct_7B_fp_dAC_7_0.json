This means that if Alex finished the race, then it follows that Chris finished the race as well. The second statement is 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nNow, let's analyze this information:\n1. The second statement tells us that Chris finished the race.\n2. Since the first statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race as well, it means that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n3. However, the first statement does not tell us that Alex finished the race. It only tells us that if he did, then Chris did as well.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot deduce 'Alex finished the race' based on the given information."
