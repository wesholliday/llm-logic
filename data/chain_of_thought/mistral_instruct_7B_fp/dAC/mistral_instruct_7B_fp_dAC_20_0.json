The first premise tells us that if 'P' is true, then 'Q' must be true. The second premise tells us that 'Q' is indeed true. Therefore, according to modus ponens, 'P' must also be true.\n\nSo, if 'The banana was yellow' is true, and if 'The apple was red' implies 'The banana was yellow', then 'The apple was red' must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
