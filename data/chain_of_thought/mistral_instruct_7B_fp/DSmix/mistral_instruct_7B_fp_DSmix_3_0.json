The second statement 'The splat might not be quanked' suggests that there is a possibility that the splat is not in the state of being quanked. However, this statement does not provide any information about the state of the splat being morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat is morphed' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
