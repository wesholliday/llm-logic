The second statement 'The flob might not be movated' suggests that there is a possibility that the flob cannot be moved. However, this statement does not provide any information about the flob being skizzled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
