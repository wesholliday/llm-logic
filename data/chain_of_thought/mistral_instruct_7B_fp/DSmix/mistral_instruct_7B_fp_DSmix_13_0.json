The second statement 'The glip might not be tragged' means that it is possible that the glip is not in the state of being tragged. However, this statement does not provide any information about the state of the glip being slogged. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
