The statement 'The fribble might not be crinked' means that it is possible for the fribble not to be in the crinked state. However, this statement does not provide any information about the fribble being in the snurgled state. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble is snurgled' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
