'The shank might not be nugged' means that there is a possibility that the shank is not in the state of being nugged. However, this statement does not provide any information about the state of the shank being plooked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shank is plooked' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
