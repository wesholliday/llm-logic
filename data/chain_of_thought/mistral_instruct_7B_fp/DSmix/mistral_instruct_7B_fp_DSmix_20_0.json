The first statement only tells us that the fleeg is either bluttered or surned, and the second statement only tells us that the fleeg might not be surned. It does not tell us that the fleeg is definitely bluttered.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' based on the given information."
