The statement 'The twonk might not be plinked' means that it is possible that the twonk is not plinked. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the twonk is varnished or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk is varnished' based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
