The second statement 'The flugel might not be zargled' suggests that it is possible for the flugel not to be zargled. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the flugel is blimmed. The two statements do not provide enough information to infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
