The word 'spened' is not a standard English word, and it's unclear what it means in this context. However, we can assume that it means 'spent' or 'used up'.\n\nThe statement 'The dreb might not be spened' means that there is a possibility that the dreb is not 'spened' or 'used up'. This statement does not contradict the first statement, as it does not necessarily mean that the dreb is not 'vroombed'.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
