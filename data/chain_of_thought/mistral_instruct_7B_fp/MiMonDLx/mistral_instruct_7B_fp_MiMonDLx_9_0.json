However, it does not exclude the possibility that the frazzle could be something else, such as a quimble. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say that 'The frazzle might be wump or quimble' is true, but we cannot also say it's false. It is a possibility that needs further information to confirm.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The frazzle might be wump or quimble' from 'The frazzle might be wump' alone. However, it is a possibility that needs further information to confirm."
