However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the zibber being any other thing. To infer 'The zibber might be wozzle flim or quibble frazzle fribble', we would need some indication or hint that the zibber could also be quibble frazzle fribble. Without such an indication, we cannot make this inference based on the given sentence alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
