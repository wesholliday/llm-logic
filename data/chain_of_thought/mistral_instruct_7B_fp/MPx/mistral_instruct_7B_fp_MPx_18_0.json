The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the shank was plooked) is true, then the consequence (the shank was nugged) must also be true. The second premise states that the condition is indeed true. Therefore, based on the principles of logical reasoning, we can infer that the consequence must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
