The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smip was shripped) is true, then the consequence (the smip lupped the zoint) must also be true. The second statement is a fact that the smip was indeed shripped.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is true (the smip was shripped), according to the conditional statement, the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can infer 'The smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
