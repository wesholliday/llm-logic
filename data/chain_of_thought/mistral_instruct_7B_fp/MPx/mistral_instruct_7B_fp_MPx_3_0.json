The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanked) must also be true. The second statement is a fact that the splat was indeed morphed.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is true (the splat was morphed), according to the conditional statement, the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat quanked'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
