            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the fribble is snurgled, then the fribble crinked. The second statement 'The fribble was snurgled' tells us that the condition in the first statement is true, i.e., the fribble was indeed snurgled. Since the first statement tells us that if the fribble is snurgled, then it crinkles, and we know that the fribble was snurgled, we can infer that the fribble must have crinked as well.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
