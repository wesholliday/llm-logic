The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the consequence (the flob movated) is also true. The second premise states that the condition is indeed true. Therefore, based on the principles of logical reasoning, we can infer that the consequence is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
