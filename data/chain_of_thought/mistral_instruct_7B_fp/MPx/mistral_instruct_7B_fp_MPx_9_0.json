The second statement 'The twonk was plinked' tells us that the twonk was indeed plinked. However, the first statement does not guarantee that the twonk was varnished just because it was plinked. It only tells us that if it was plinked, then it was varnished. Therefore, we cannot infer 'It was varnished' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
