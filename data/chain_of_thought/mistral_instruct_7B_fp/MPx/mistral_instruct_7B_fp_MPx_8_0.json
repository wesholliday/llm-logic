            "content": "Explanation:\nThe first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, meaning that if the sprocket was cranked, then it follows that the sprocket was daggled. The second statement 'The sprocket was cranked' tells us that the condition in the first statement is true. However, the truth of the first statement does not necessarily mean that the consequent (the sprocket was daggled) is also true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was daggled' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
