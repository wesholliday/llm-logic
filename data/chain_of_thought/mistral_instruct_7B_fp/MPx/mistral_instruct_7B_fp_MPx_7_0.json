The second statement 'The whiffle was shanked' tells us that the whiffle was indeed hit poorly.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that if the whiffle is shanked, it will tink, and the second statement tells us that the whiffle was shanked, it follows logically that the whiffle should have tinked.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
