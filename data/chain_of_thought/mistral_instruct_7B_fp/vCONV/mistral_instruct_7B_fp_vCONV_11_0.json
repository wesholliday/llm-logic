            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of contrapositive argument, which means that if the original conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is given, the contrapositive statement 'If not Q, then not P' can be derived.\n\nHowever, the validity of a contrapositive argument depends on the original conditional statement being a material implication. A material implication is a logical connective that means 'if and only if'. In other words, if P implies Q, then not Q implies not P.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This statement is not necessarily a material implication. It could be a simple conditional statement, meaning that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it does not mean that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine if this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the form of argument is not logically valid based on the information given."
