            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of contrapositive argument, which means that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. In logical terms, the contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. Conclusion: If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise would be: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion with the contrapositive of the premise:\n\n1. Conclusion: If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\n2. Contrapositive of the premise: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe conclusion does not match the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
