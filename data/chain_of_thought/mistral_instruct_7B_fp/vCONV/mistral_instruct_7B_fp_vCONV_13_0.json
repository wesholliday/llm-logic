            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form is known as contrapositive logic. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P implies Q' is 'not Q implies not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the argument is not logically valid. The contrapositive of 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. However, this statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. For example, if the car is red and the truck is blue, then the original statement is true. But if the truck is not blue, it does not necessarily mean that the car is not red. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid."
