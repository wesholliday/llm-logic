            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of contrapositive logic, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q', then 'not Q' implies 'not P'. In this case, the original premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' (P implies Q), and the conclusion is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' (not Q implies not P).\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
