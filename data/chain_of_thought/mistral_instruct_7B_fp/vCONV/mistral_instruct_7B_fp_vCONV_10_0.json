In logic, a contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\nPremise: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nConclusion: If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise would be: If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nComparing the conclusion of the argument with the contrapositive of the premise, we can see that they are not the same. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
