The validity of an argument depends on the relationship between its premises and its conclusion. In a valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. This means that if Alex finished the race, then it follows that Chris also finished the race. However, the conclusion is 'If Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race'. This means that if Chris finished a face (which is not related to the race), then it follows that Alex finished the race.\n\nThe two statements are not logically related, so even if the premise is true, the conclusion could still be false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
