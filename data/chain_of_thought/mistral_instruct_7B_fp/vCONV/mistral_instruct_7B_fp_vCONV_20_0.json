            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form is known as a contrapositive argument. In logic, a conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q.\" Its contrapositive has the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the contrapositive of the original conditional statement follows from the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.'\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.'\n\nNow, let's check if the contrapositive follows from the original statement.\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (original statement).\n\nIf the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red (contrapositive).\n\nFrom the original statement, we cannot directly infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
