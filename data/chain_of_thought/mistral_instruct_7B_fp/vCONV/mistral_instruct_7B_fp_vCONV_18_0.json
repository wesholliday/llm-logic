In other words, we need to see if the argument preserves truth.\n\nTo do this, we can use a truth table, which is a table that shows all possible combinations of truth values for the premise and the conclusion.\n\nHere's the truth table for this argument:\n\n| P (doll was plastic) | Q (truck was metal) | P -> Q | Q -> P | (P -> Q) -> (Q -> P) |\n|----------------------|---------------------|-------|-------|---------------------|\n| True                 | True                | True  | True  | True                |\n| True                 | False               | False | False | False               |\n| False                | True                | True  | False | False               |\n| False                | False               | True  | True  | True                |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the argument is not logically valid because there is at least one case where the premise is true, and the conclusion is false (the second row).\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
