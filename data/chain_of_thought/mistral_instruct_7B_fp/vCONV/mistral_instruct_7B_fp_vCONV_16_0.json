            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of contrapositive logic, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q', then 'not Q' implies 'not P'. In this case, the original premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nTo form the contrapositive, we need to negate both the premise and the conclusion, resulting in 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nNow, let's compare the original argument and its contrapositive:\n\nOriginal Argument:\nPremise: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\nConclusion: If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\n\nContrapositive Argument:\nPremise: If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\nConclusion: If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\n\nSince the original argument and its contrapositive have the same logical structure, they are logically equivalent. This means that if the original argument is valid, then the contrapositive is also valid, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, to determine if the original argument is logically valid, we need to check if its premise is a logical truth or if it follows from some other accepted logical principles. In this case, the premise is not a logical truth, and its validity depends on the truth of the underlying facts.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the original argument is not logically valid without additional information about the truth of its premise. However, it is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is also not logically valid without additional information."
