The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given in the argument is 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane', which is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
