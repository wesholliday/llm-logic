            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of conditional logic, specifically a contrapositive argument. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. The contrapositive would be 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given in the question is not the contrapositive of the premise. The conclusion is 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise, because the two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo. The argument is not logically valid."
