In logic, a contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\nPremise: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nConclusion: If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\n\nContrapositive of the premise: If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\nContrapositive of the conclusion: If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThe given argument is not logically equivalent to its contrapositive. The contrapositive of the conclusion is not the same as the original premise. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
