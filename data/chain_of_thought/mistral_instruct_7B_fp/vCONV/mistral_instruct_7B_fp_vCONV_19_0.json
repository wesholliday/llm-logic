            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement, and its form can be represented as follows:\n\nIf P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball)\nTherefore, if Q (Jen watched basketball), then P (Tom watched football)\n\nThis form of argument is known as a contrapositive argument, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement if the original statement is a material conditional.\n\nHowever, the logical validity of the argument depends on the truth of the original conditional statement. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive argument is also logically valid. If the original statement is false, then the contrapositive argument can still be logically valid or invalid, depending on the truth of the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is not possible to determine the logical validity of the argument without knowing the truth of the original conditional statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. Therefore, the answer is 'cannot be determined' based on the given information."
