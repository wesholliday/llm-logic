            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of contrapositive logic, which states that if 'P' implies 'Q', then 'not Q' implies 'not P'. In this case, the original premise is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' (P implies Q), and the conclusion is 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta' (not Q implies not P).\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the contrapositive of the original premise is true.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is 'If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nIf the contrapositive is true, then the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid. The contrapositive 'If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' is true if 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is true. This is because if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and if Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta as well (since we cannot have Kate eating salad if Ben did not eat pasta). Therefore, the argument is logically valid."
