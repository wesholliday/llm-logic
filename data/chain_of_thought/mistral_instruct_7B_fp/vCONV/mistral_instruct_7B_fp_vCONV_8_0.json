In this case, the original argument is 'If the vampire was awake then the mummy was awake' (P -> Q). The contrapositive would be 'If the mummy was not awake then the vampire was not awake' (not Q -> not P).\n\nHowever, the conclusion given in the question is 'If the mummy was awake then the vampire was awake' (Q -> P). This is not the contrapositive of the original premise, so it's not clear if this argument is logically valid or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\n\nI'm unable to determine if the argument is logically valid or not with the information provided. The conclusion given in the question does not match the expected form of the contrapositive."
