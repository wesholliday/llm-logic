However, the value of the artwork does not necessarily mean that it is authentic. Therefore, while the artwork being valuable suggests that it might be authentic, it is not a sufficient reason to infer that the artwork is definitely authentic.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The artwork might be authentic' from 'The artwork might be authentic and worth millions'."
