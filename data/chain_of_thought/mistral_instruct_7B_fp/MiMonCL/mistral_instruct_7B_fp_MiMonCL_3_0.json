            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients' implies that the recipe is complex in terms of its instructions or steps, and it also mentions that certain hard-to-find or unusual ingredients are needed. While the mention of exotic ingredients is not necessary to infer that the recipe is complicated, it does add to the complexity. However, the complexity of the recipe can be inferred from the statement itself, without needing to mention the exotic ingredients. Therefore, 'The recipe might be complicated' can be inferred from 'The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
