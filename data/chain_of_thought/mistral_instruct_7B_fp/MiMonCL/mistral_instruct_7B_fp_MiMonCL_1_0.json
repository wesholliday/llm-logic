            "content": "Explanation:\nThe phrase 'The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled' suggests that there are two potential events that could happen to the flibbit. The first event is 'zorping', and the second event is 'gribbling'. Since 'and' is used to connect these two events, it implies that both events are possible, but they do not necessarily have to happen at the same time. Therefore, it is possible to infer that 'The flibbit might be zorped', as 'zorping' is one of the potential events mentioned.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
