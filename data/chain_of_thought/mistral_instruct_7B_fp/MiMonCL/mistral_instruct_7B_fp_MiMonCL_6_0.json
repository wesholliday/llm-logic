However, it does not necessarily mean that the experiment will definitely be successful. Therefore, while it is possible that the experiment might be successful, we cannot infer with certainty that it will be.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'The experiment might be successful' from 'The experiment might be successful and yield groundbreaking results' alone. The second part of the statement adds an additional condition, which is that the results could be groundbreaking if the experiment is successful. This does not necessarily mean that the experiment will be successful."
