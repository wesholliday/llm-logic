However, it does not necessarily mean that the contract is definitely legally binding. The 'might' in the statement indicates uncertainty. Therefore, while it is possible to infer that 'The contract might be legally binding', it is not a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, it is possible to infer that 'The contract might be legally binding', but it is not a certainty."
