However, the statement does not necessarily mean that the disease is definitely contagious; it only suggests that it might be. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The disease might be contagious' from this statement alone, but we can say that it is a reasonable inference based on the information given.\n\nAnswer:\nWhile it is a reasonable inference, we cannot definitively say 'yes' based on the given statement alone. The statement only suggests that the disease might be contagious, but it does not provide enough evidence to confirm it. Therefore, the answer is 'no', we cannot infer 'The disease might be contagious' from the given statement with absolute certainty."
