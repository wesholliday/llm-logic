However, the statement does not explicitly say that Sarah might study both subjects. Therefore, while it is not impossible for Sarah to study both biology and chemistry, we cannot infer this from the given information alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'Sarah might study biology and Sarah might study chemistry' based on 'Sarah might study biology or chemistry'."
