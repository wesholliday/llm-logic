However, this statement does not guarantee that taking expired medication will have the same effect. The efficacy of medication can be affected by its expiration date, as the active ingredients may degrade over time. Therefore, it is not safe or logical to infer that 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
