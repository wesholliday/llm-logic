            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If I finish my homework, I can play video games' is a conditional statement that implies that if a certain condition (finishing homework) is met, then a consequence (playing video games) follows. However, the second statement 'If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games' introduces a new and unrelated condition (computer catching on fire) that makes the consequence (playing video games) impossible. Therefore, we cannot infer that the second statement is true based on the first one.\n\nAnswer: No."
