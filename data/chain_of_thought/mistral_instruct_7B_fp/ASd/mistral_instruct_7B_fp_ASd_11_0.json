            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired' is a conditional statement that suggests a cause-effect relationship between getting enough sleep and not feeling tired. However, it only applies to the specific condition of getting enough sleep. The new statement 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired' is an extension of the original statement, but it introduces a new condition: doing hard labor.\n\nTo infer whether this new statement is logically valid, we need to consider whether the new condition (doing hard labor) interacts with the original condition (getting enough sleep) in a way that maintains the cause-effect relationship.\n\nIf doing hard labor does not negate the effect of getting enough sleep, then it could be inferred that 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired'. However, without specific information about how these two conditions interact, it's not possible to definitively say 'yes' or 'no'.\n\nAnswer: It cannot be definitively answered based on the given information."
