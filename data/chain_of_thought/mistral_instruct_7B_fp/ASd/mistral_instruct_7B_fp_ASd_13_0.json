However, the second statement 'If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight' introduces a new variable: diet. Eating junk food is generally high in calories and low in nutrients, which can hinder weight loss. Therefore, it is not logical to infer that exercising while eating junk food will lead to weight loss based on the information provided in the first statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
