            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If I study hard, I will pass the test' is a conditional statement that implies that if the condition (studying hard) is met, then the consequence (passing the test) will occur. However, the new statement 'If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test' introduces a new condition (the test being in Chinese) that was not present in the original statement. While studying hard may still help in understanding the material, the language barrier could potentially affect the ability to pass the test. Therefore, it is not safe to infer that the new statement is necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test' is true based on 'If I study hard, I will pass the test'."
