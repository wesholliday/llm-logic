However, the second statement 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out' introduces a new condition that the oven might not be functioning properly even if it's turned on. The pilot light is a small flame that keeps the oven's main burner lit, and if it's out, the oven might not heat up properly. Therefore, we cannot infer that the kitchen will be warm in this case.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
