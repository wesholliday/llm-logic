This means that if the package has been shipped, then it is expected to arrive today. However, the second part of the new statement, 'it was misrouted', introduces a new variable that was not considered in the original statement. Misrouting could mean that the package will not arrive today, even if it has been shipped. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
