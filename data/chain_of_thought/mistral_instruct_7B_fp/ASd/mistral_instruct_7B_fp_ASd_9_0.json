However, the statement does not take into account other factors such as submission deadlines.\n\nTo infer 'If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A', we would need to assume that the grading system is flexible enough to consider late submissions and that the quality of the essay is still the primary factor in determining the grade, even if it is submitted late.\n\nHowever, without additional information about the grading system and policies, it is not possible to definitively say 'yes' or 'no'. Therefore, the inference cannot be made based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, the inference cannot be made based on the given information."
