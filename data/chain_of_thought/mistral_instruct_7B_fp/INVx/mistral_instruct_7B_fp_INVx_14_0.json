This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug snugged) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. The converse of this statement would be 'If the clug was snugged, then the clug was fleeked'. This is not necessarily true, as the fleeked-ness of the clug is not necessarily dependent on it being snugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged'. This is also a conditional statement, but it is the negation of the original statement. If the first part (the clug was not fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug was not snugged) must also be true. This is because the fleeked-ness of the clug and the snugged-ness of the clug are dependent on each other in this statement. If the clug is not fleeked, then it is not reasonable to assume that it is snugged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
