            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement. It means that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that if the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink. This is because the original statement only establishes a relationship between 'sploffed' and 'plopped the frink', and does not rule out the possibility of the grommet plopping the frink under other circumstances.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink' from the given statement."
