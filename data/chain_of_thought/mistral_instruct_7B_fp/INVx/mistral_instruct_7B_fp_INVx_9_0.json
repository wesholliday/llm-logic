It means that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens if the twonk was not plinked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
