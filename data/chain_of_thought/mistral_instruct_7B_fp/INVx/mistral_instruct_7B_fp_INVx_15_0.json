            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form 'If P then Q', where P is 'the dreb was vroombed' and Q is 'the dreb was spened'. This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is true, then P must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened'. This is also a conditional statement, but this time the condition P is 'the dreb was not vroombed' and the consequence Q is 'the dreb was not spened'.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the given statement, we need to consider if the opposite of the consequence Q (i.e., 'the dreb was not spened') follows from the opposite of the condition P (i.e., 'the dreb was not vroombed').\n\nIn other words, we need to check if 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened' is a logically valid statement.\n\nTo do this, we can use a truth table:\n\n| P | Q | P \u27f9 Q | \u00acP | \u00acQ | \u00acP \u27f9 \u00acQ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | F | F | T |\n| T | F | F | F | T | T |\n| F | T | ? | T | F | ? |\n| F | F | T | T | T | T |\n\nHere, P is 'the dreb was vroombed' and Q is 'the dreb was spened'. The third column represents the truth value of the conditional statement 'P \u27f9 Q', and the fifth column represents the truth value of the conditional statement '\u00acP \u27f9 \u00acQ'.\n\nFrom the given statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened', we know that the conditional statement 'P \u27f9 Q' is true when P is true and Q is true (first row), and false when P is true and Q is false (second row).\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite of the given statement, which is 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened'. This is equivalent to the conditional statement '\u00acP \u27f9 \u00acQ'.\n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to check if the opposite of the consequence Q (i.e., 'the dreb was not spened') follows from the opposite of the condition P (i.e., 'the dreb was not vroombed').\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conditional statement '\u00acP \u27f9 \u00acQ' is true when P is false and Q is false (fourth row), and true when P is false and Q is true (third row).\n\nSince the conditional statement '\u00acP \u27f9 \u00acQ' is true in the third row, we can infer that 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened' is a logically valid statement.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
