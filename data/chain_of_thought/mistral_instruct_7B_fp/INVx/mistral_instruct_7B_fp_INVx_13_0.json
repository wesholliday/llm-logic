This means that if the condition P (the glip was slogged) is true, then the consequence Q (the glip was tragged) is also true.\n\nHowever, this statement does not provide any information about the relationship between not slogging the glip and not tragging the glip. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged' based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
