It means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was also daggled. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that."
