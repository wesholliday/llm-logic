This means that if the condition 'the smip was shripped' is true, then the consequence 'the smip lupped the zoint' is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. The converse is 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped'. This means that if the consequence is true, then the condition must also be true. But this is not necessarily the case. The smip could have lupped the zoint for some other reason, not because it was shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint'. This is a denial of the consequence, given the denial of the condition. If the smip was not shripped, then it could not have lupped the zoint because of the given if-then statement. But this does not mean that the smip never lupped the zoint for some other reason.\n\nSo, we cannot infer 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
