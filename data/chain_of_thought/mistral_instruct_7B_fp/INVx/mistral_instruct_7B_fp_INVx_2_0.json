This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if P is false, then Q must be false.\n\nIn other words, the statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' does not provide enough information to infer 'If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer that from the given statement."
