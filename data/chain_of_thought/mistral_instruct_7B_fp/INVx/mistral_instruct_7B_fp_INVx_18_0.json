This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that if Q is true, then P must also be true. Nor does it imply that if P is false, then Q must be false.\n\nIn other words, the given statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. But it does not tell us anything about what happens if the shank was not plooked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
