This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is true, then P must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the given statement. The inverse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In other words, if Q is not true, then P must also not be true.\n\nApplying this to our given statement, we get 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
