Here, 'P' is 'the fleeg was bluttered' and 'Q' is 'it surned'. This statement means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nHowever, to infer 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn' from this statement, we would need an additional piece of information. This is because the given statement does not provide enough information to conclude that if the fleeg was not bluttered, it did not surn. The given statement only tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, it surned, but it does not tell us what happens if the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
