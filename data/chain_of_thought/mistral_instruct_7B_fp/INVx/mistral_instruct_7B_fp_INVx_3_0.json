However, it does not necessarily mean that if the splat is not morphed, it does not quank. The statement only provides information about the relationship between being morphed and quanking, not about the absence of quanking when the splat is not morphed.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' from the given statement."
