            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'. This type of statement means that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q is also true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if P is false, then Q is also false.\n\nIn other words, the given statement does not provide enough information to infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink'. This is because the statement only tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if the sneg is not crampled.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' based on the given statement."
