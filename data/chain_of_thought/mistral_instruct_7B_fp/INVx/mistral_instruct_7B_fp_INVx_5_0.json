            "content": "Explanation:\nThe given statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition 'the zinger was fraggled' is true, then the consequence 'the zinger was smoogled' must also be true. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens if the condition is false.\n\nTo infer 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled', we need to assume that the converse of the original statement is also true. The converse of 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' is 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nIf the converse is true, then it means that if the consequence 'the zinger was not smoogled' is true, then the condition 'the zinger was not fraggled' must also be true. This implies that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it was not smoogled.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer this from the original statement alone. We would need additional information or assumptions to conclude that the converse is also true.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled' from 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' alone."
