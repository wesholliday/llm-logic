It means that if the whiffle (a type of ball) was shanked (hit poorly, often causing a unique sound), then the whiffle tinked (made a specific sound).\n\nHowever, this statement does not provide enough information to infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink'. The given statement only tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, it tinked. It does not imply that if the whiffle was not shanked, it did not tink. For example, the whiffle might have been hit perfectly and made a different sound, or it might have not made any sound at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
