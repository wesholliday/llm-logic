This type of statement means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn other words, the given statement does not provide enough information to infer 'If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged'. This is because the statement only tells us that if the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged. It does not tell us anything about what happens if the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, we cannot infer 'If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged' from the given statement."
