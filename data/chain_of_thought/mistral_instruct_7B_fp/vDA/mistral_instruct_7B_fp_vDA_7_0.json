            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a contrapositive argument. In a contrapositive argument, if the original conditional statement is 'If P then Q', the contrapositive statement is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. The contrapositive statement would be 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nThe argument given to us is 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race' (this is the contrapositive of the original statement), and 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'Chris did not finish the race', which is the same as the second premise. Since the conclusion is the same as one of the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
