            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise 1)\n2. Jeff did not play basketball. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Amy did not play tennis. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If such a scenario exists, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nHowever, in this case, it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. This is because if Jeff did not play basketball (Premise 2), then by the first premise, Amy cannot have played tennis. Therefore, the conclusion 'Amy did not play tennis' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
