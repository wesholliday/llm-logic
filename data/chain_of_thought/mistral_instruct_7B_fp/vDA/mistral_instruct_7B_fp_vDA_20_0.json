The second premise is 'The apple was not red'. The conclusion is 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nIf the apple was not red, then according to the conditional statement, the banana cannot be yellow. Therefore, if the second premise is true (the apple was not red), then the conclusion (the banana was not yellow) must also be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
