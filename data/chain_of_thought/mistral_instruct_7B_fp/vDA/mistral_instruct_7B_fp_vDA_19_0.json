            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Premise 1)\n2. Tom did not watch football. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Jen did not watch basketball. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) followed by the denial of the antecedent (the 'if' part). In this case, the antecedent is 'Tom watched football'.\n\nNow, let's test the argument by assuming the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true. If we assume that Premise 1 is true (i.e., if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball), and Premise 2 is also true (i.e., Tom did not watch football), then the conclusion 'Jen did not watch basketball' must be true as well. This is because if the first premise is not true (i.e., Tom did not watch football), then the entire conditional statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' does not apply, and we cannot make any conclusions about Jen watching basketball.\n\nSo, if we assume the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
