            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if denying the conclusion would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (Premise 1)\n2. The shirt was not cotton. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the pants were not denim. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false: 'The pants were denim'.\n\nIf the pants were denim, then according to Premise 1, the shirt must be cotton. But Premise 2 states that the shirt is not cotton. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'The shirt was not cotton' and 'The shirt was cotton' be true at the same time.\n\nSince denying the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
