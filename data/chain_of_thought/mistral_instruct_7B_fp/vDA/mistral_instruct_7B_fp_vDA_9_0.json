            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1)\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's test the argument for validity by assuming the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true.\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1)\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 2 tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can infer that Premise 1 cannot be true (because if it were, then Lisa would have bought the red shirt, which we know she did not).\n\nIf Premise 1 is not true, then the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is false. This means that the 'if' part of the conditional statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) is false, but the 'then' part (Mark bought the blue shirt) is not necessarily false. However, since we are assuming the premises are true, we cannot know for sure if Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nSince we cannot definitively say that Mark did not buy the blue shirt given the truth of the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
