            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional 'If P then Q' is logically equivalent to 'not P or Q'. This means that the argument is valid if and only if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This can be translated into 'not Mary was at the wedding or Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nThe second premise is 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nTo check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can substitute the negation of the second premise into the first premise. So, we have 'not (not Mary was at the wedding) or Sue was at the wedding'. This simplifies to 'Mary was at the wedding or Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nHowever, this is not the same as the conclusion 'Sue was not at the wedding'. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo."
