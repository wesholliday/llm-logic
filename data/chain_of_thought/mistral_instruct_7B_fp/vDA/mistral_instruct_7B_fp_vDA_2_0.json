            "content": "Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of deductive reasoning that goes as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case, P is 'The griffin was in the forest', and Q is 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (This is an assumption or a premise that we are given.)\n2. The griffin was not in the forest. (This is another premise that we are given.)\n3. Therefore, the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nExplanation of how the conclusion follows from the premises:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (premise 1). But we know that the griffin was not in the forest (premise 2). Therefore, it must be the case that the griffin being in the forest is not true (premise 2 contradicts premise 1). Since the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn being in the forest (premise 1), if the griffin being in the forest is not true, then the unicorn being in the forest must also not be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
