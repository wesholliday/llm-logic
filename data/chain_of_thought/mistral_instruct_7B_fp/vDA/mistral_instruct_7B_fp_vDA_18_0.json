            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n2. The doll was not plastic. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the truck was not metal. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's test the argument by assuming the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true.\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Assume this is true)\n2. The doll was not plastic. (Assume this is true)\n\nSince the doll was not plastic, according to Premise 1, the truck must be metal. But we also assumed that the doll was not plastic, so Premise 2 contradicts Premise 1. This means that at least one of the premises must be false.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion can be false if the premises are true. If the doll was not plastic and the truck was metal, then the conclusion 'The truck was not metal' would be false.\n\nSince the conclusion can be false if the premises are true, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."
