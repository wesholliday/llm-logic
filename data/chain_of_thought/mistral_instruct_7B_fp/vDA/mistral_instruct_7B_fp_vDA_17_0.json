            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. (Premise 1)\n2. Ben did not eat pasta. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Kate did not eat salad. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's test the argument by assuming the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true. If we can find a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAssuming Premise 1 and Premise 2 are true:\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. (Premise 1)\n2. Ben did not eat pasta. (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 2 tells us that Ben did not eat pasta, and Premise 1 tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, it follows that Kate did not eat salad. This is because the condition for Kate to eat salad (Ben eating pasta) is not met.\n\nSo, if we cannot find a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
