The negation of the consequent is 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the car was not red, does it logically follow that the truck was not blue?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue (premise 1)\n2. The car was not red (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the truck was not blue (conclusion)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue (premise 1)\n2. The car was not red (premise 2)\n\nSince the car was not red, it cannot be the case that the car was red and the truck was blue (as stated in premise 1). Therefore, the truck must not be blue.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
