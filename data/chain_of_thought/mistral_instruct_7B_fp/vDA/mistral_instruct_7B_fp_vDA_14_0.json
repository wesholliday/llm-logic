            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it necessarily true that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Premise 1)\n2. The bear was not in the cave (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the wolf was not in the den (Conclusion)\n\nTo test the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called \"contradiction\" or \"reductio ad absurdum\". This means we assume the opposite of the conclusion and see if it leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's assume the opposite of the conclusion:\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Premise 1)\n2. The bear was not in the cave (Premise 2)\n3. However, the wolf was in the den (Assumption of the opposite of the conclusion)\n\nNow, let's see if this assumption leads to a contradiction with the premises:\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Premise 1)\n2. The bear was not in the cave (Premise 2)\n3. However, the wolf was in the den (Assumption)\n\nSince Premise 2 states that the bear was not in the cave, and our assumption contradicts this, we have found a contradiction. This means that our assumption (the opposite of the conclusion) cannot be true if the premises are true. Therefore, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the form of argument is logically valid."
