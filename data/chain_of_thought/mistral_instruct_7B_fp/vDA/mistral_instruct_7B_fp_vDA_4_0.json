            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (P1)\n2. The alien did not visit Mars (P2)\n3. Therefore, the robot did not visit Jupiter (C)\n\nThe form of this argument is a conditional statement (P1) followed by the negation of the antecedent of that conditional statement (P2), and then the consequent of the conditional statement (C). This is known as a \"contrapositive argument\" or \"modus tollens\".\n\nIn a contrapositive argument, if the conclusion is true, then the premises must be true. If the conclusion is false, then at least one of the premises must be false.\n\nIn this case, if the robot did visit Jupiter (C is false), then the alien must have visited Mars (P1). But we know that the alien did not visit Mars (P2), so the robot cannot have visited Jupiter. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
