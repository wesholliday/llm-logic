In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (Premise 1)\n2. The dog was not inside. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the cat was not outside. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If this scenario is impossible, then the argument is valid.\n\nScenario: The dog and the cat are both inside the house.\n\nHowever, this scenario contradicts the first premise, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. Therefore, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
