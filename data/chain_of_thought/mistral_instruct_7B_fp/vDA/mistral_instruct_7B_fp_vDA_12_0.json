            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is in the form of a conditional statement followed by its contrapositive. The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nThe first premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. The second premise is 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nTo check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we can substitute the premises into the contrapositive form of the first premise: 'If not Lucy went to the zoo, then not Joe went to the park'.\n\nGiven the second premise 'Joe did not go to the park', if we substitute this into the contrapositive form, we get 'If not Lucy went to the zoo, then not Joe went to the park'. Since the two statements are the same, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, the conclusion 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' logically follows from the premises 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes."
