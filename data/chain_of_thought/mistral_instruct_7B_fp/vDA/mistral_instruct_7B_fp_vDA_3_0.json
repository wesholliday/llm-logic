            "content": "Explanation:\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\n2. The book was not written by James (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book is not a mystery novel (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's test the argument by assuming the premises are true and see if the conclusion follows:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\n2. The book was not written by James (Premise 2)\n\nGiven that Premise 2 is true, the book was not written by James. Since Premise 1 states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, and we know that the book was not written by James, the conclusion 'The book is not a mystery novel' must be true.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. The argument is logically valid."
