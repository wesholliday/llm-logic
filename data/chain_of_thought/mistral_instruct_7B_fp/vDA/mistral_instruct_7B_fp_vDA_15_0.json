In other words, if the premises are true, is it necessarily true that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (Premise 1)\n2. Sam did not take a plane (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Erin did not take a train (Conclusion)\n\nTo test the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called reductio ad absurdum. This means we assume the opposite of the conclusion and see if it leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's assume the opposite of the conclusion:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (Premise 1)\n2. Sam did not take a plane (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Erin took a train (Assuming the opposite of the conclusion)\n\nNow, let's see if this assumption leads to a contradiction with Premise 1:\nIf Erin took a train, then according to Premise 1, Sam must have taken a plane (since the if-then statement in Premise 1 is a conditional statement). But we know from Premise 2 that Sam did not take a plane. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both 'Sam took a plane' and 'Sam did not take a plane' be true at the same time.\n\nSince the assumption of the opposite of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes, the argument is logically valid."
