In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (P1)\n2. Sue did not choose pizza (P2)\n3. Therefore, Bob did not choose pasta (C)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. This would mean that Sue did not choose pizza (P2 is true), but Bob did choose pasta (C is false).\n\nHowever, if we look at the first premise (P1), it states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. In this scenario, if Sue did not choose pizza (P2 is true), then according to P1, Bob should not have chosen pasta either. But this contradicts our assumption that Bob did choose pasta (C is false).\n\nSince we cannot find a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer:\nYes."
