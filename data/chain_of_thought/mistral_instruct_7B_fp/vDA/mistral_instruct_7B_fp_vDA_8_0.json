In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (P1)\n2. The vampire was not awake (P2)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was not awake (C)\n\nNow, let's consider a possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. This would mean that the vampire was not awake, but the mummy was awake. However, this scenario contradicts the first premise of the argument. Therefore, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid."
