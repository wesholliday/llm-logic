The argument is:\n\"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\"\nFrom this argument, we cannot directly infer \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\" Here's why:\n1. The argument only states that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer. This means that it's possible that the notebook is in the drawer, but it's not necessarily true.\n2. The argument doesn't provide any information about the location of the notebook. It only negates the possibility that the notebook must be in the drawer.\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" from the given argument alone.\nAnswer: no",
