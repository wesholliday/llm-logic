The statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that there is no logical necessity for Mary to have attended the wedding. In other words, it's possible that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n2. If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it's possible that she wasn't there.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\nAnswer: yes",
