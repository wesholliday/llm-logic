Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\nStep 1: Understand the premise\nThe premise is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This means that there is no necessary connection between Lisa and the red shirt, i.e., it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion\nThe conclusion we want to draw is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nBased on the premise and conclusion, we need to determine if there are any logical connections between them. In this case, since the premise states that there is no necessary connection between Lisa and the red shirt, it follows logically that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. Therefore, the argument is valid.\nStep 4: Confirm the answer\nAnswer: yes",
