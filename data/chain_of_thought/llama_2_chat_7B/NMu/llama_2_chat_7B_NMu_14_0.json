In this case, the premise does not explicitly state that the milk is not on the counter, but rather that it is not the case that the milk must be on the counter. This implies that the milk could potentially be somewhere else, such as in the fridge or on the table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk might not be on the counter.\"\nAnswer: yes",
