Premise 2: The smonk plagged (given)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the smonk was vreebled?\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate the argument based on the information provided in the premises.\nStep 1: Evaluate the first premise\nThe first premise states that if the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged. This means that if the smonk had the capacity or ability to be vreebled, it would have also had the capacity or ability to plagge.\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise\nThe second premise states that the smonk plagged. This provides evidence that the smonk did indeed have the capacity or ability to plagge, which in turn supports the conclusion that it was vreebled.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can conclude that if the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
