Premise 2: The flugel was zargled (given)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the flugel was blimmed?\nTo answer this question, we need to use logical reasoning and follow the argument's structure. Since the conclusion is drawn from the premises using the logical operator \"therefore,\" we can infer that the conclusion follows logically from the premises if they are true.\nNow, let me evaluate each premise:\nPremise 1: If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\nThis premise is given, and it means that if the flugel was blimmed (whatever that means), then it was also zargled (again, whatever that means).\nPremise 2: The flugel was zargled\nThis premise is also given, and it means that the flugel was in some state of being zargled.\nNow, let me apply logical reasoning to the argument:\nConclusion: Therefore, the flugel was blimmed?\nTo answer this question, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Since the premises are given, and they are true, we can conclude that if the flugel was zargled (premise 2), then it was also blimmed (if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled, by premise 1). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\nAnswer: yes",
