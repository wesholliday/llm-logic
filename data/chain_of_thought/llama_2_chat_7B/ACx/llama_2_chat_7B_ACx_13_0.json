Therefore, the conclusion to be inferred is \"The glip was slogged\".\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nWe have two premises and one conclusion. The premises are logically connected by the word \"then\", which implies a causal relationship between the two events (slogging and tragging). Therefore, we can conclude that if the glip was slogged, it must have been tragged.\nStep 4: Provide the answer\nAnswer: yes",
