In other words, we want to know if the statement \"The shank was plooked\" follows from the premises.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nTo evaluate the argument, we need to consider how well the premises support the conclusion. We can do this by asking ourselves whether the premises provide sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion.\nIn this case, the first premise \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" suggests that if the shank was plooked, it must have been nugged as well. The second premise \"The shank was nugged\" simply states that the shank was indeed nugged.\nBased on these premises, we can infer that if the shank was nugged, then it must have been plooked as well. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
