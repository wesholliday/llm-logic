Premise 1: If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled (this is the given premise)\n2. Premise 2: The sprocket was daggled (this is the second premise)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from the given premises:\n3. If Premise 1 is true, then we know that if the sprocket was cranked, it was daggled.\n4. Since we are given in Premise 2 that the sprocket was daggled, we can conclude that if the sprocket was cranked (according to Premise 1), then it was cranked.\n5. Therefore, based on the argument, we can infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from the given premises.\nAnswer: yes",
