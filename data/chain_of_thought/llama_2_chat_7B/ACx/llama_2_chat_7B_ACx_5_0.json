Premise 2: If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (inference)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the zinger was fraggled (inference)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\n1. The premise \"The zinger was smoogled\" is given and cannot be disputed.\n2. The inference \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is valid because if something is fraggled, it must also be smoogled (by definition).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The zinger was fraggled\" based on the premises provided.\nAnswer: yes",
