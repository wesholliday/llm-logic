This means that if the flob had been skizzled (whatever that means), it would have resulted in the flob moving.\nStep 3: Evaluating Premise 2\nThe flob moved. This is the conclusion we want to draw from the argument.\nStep 4: Inferring the Conclusion\nBased on the premises, can we infer that the flob was skizzled? Well, if the flob moved, and it moved only if it was skizzled, then it must have been skizzled. Therefore, our answer is...\nAnswer: yes",
