The first statement implies that if the smip was shipped, then it must have lumped the zoint. Therefore, we can infer that the second statement is true if the first statement is true.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions and make a decision\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the smip was shipped, then it must have lumped the zoint. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
