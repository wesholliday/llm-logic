From premise 1 and premise 2, we can conclude that the alien visited Mars (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" The conclusion that follows from these premises is \"The alien visited Mars.\"\nTo determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the argument is valid or not. In this case, the argument is valid because if the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true, and therefore the conclusion logically follows.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
