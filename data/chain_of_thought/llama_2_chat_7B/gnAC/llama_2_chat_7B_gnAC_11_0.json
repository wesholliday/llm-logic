The muffins were blueberry (premise 2)\nFrom these two premises, we can deduce one of three possible conclusions:\n3. Therefore, the cake was chocolate (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain why I think this conclusion follows logically from the premises:\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake had a certain characteristic (chocolate), then the muffins also had a certain characteristic (blueberry).\nThe muffins were blueberry. This means that the muffins actually had the characteristic of being blueberry.\nTherefore, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This conclusion follows logically from the premises because if the cake had a certain characteristic (chocolate), and the muffins had the same characteristic (blueberry), then it is reasonable to conclude that the cake had the same characteristic as the muffins (blueberry).\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
