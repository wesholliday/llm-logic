Conclusion: Therefore, the vampire was awake (drawing conclusion from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\nStep 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a logical implication, as the vampire and the mummy are in a logical relationship where if one is awake, the other must also be awake.\nStep 2: The mummy was awake. This premise is given and true.\nStep 3: Conclusion: Therefore, the vampire was awake. This conclusion follows logically from premises 1 and 2, as we have established that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake, and we have already established that the mummy is awake.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
