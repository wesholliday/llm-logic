Bob chose pasta (premise 2)\nTo determine whether it follows that Sue chose pizza is true, we need to use logical reasoning.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nWe are given two premises, and we need to determine if they logically lead to a conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is whether Sue chose pizza.\nStep 4: Draw conclusions\nBased on the two premises provided, we can conclude that it does follow that Sue chose pizza. Here's why:\nIf Bob chose pasta (premise 2), and if Sue chose pizza (premise 1), then we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza. This is because the two premises are linked by the word \"if,\" which implies a causal relationship between Bob's choice and Sue's choice.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
