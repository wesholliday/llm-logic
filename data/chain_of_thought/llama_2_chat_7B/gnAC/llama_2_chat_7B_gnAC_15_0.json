Therefore, the relationship between Statement 1 and Statement 2 is:\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth of each statement\nWe know that both statements are true, so we can evaluate them separately:\nStatement 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (True)\nStatement 2: Erin took a train. (True)\nStep 4: Draw conclusions based on the relationships and truth of each statement\nSince both statements are true, we can conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. Therefore, the conclusion is:\nAnswer: yes",
