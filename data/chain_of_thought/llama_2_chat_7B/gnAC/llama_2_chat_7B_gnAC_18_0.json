Conclusion: Therefore, the doll was plastic (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\nReasoning: This statement is true because plastic and metal are mutually exclusive materials. A doll cannot be made of both plastic and metal at the same time. Therefore, if the doll is plastic, it means that the truck cannot be metal.\nPremise 2: The truck was metal\nReasoning: This statement is true because we have been given that it is true.\nConclusion: Therefore, the doll was plastic\nReasoning: Based on premises 1 and 2, if the truck was metal and the doll was plastic, then it follows that the doll was plastic.\nNow, based on my reasoning above, I answer:\nAnswer: yes",
