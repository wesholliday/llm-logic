Premise 2: If the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved (given)\n3. Conclusion: The flob was not movated (inference)\nTo infer that the flob was not movated, we are using the logical rule of inference known as modus tollens. This rule states that if a conclusion follows from two premises, and one of those premises is false, then the conclusion must also be false.\nIn this case, we have two premises: (1) the flob was not skizzled, and (2) if the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved. If we assume that the first premise is true (i.e., the flob was not skizzled), and we know that the second premise is true (i.e., if the flob was skizzled, then it moved), then we can conclude that the flob did not move. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
