If the flugel was blimmed, then it would be zargled, according to the second premise.\n3. Therefore, if the flugel was zargled, it means that it was subjected to the action of being zargled.\n4. However, we know from the first premise that the flugel was not blimmed.\n5. So, if the flugel was zargled, it would be a contradiction, since we know that it was not blimmed.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
