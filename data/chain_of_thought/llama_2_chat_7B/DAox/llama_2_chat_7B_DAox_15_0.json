From the second statement, we know that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened.\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion\nIf the dreb was not vroombed (premise 1), and if it was vroombed, then it was spened (premise 2), we can conclude that the dreb was not spened (deduced from premises 1 and 2).\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
