This means that if one of the statements is true, the other statement must also be true.\nStep 3: Use the logical relationship to deduce a conclusion\nUsing the logical relationship between the statements, we can deduce that if the flug was not blummed (according to the first statement), then it was not zimmed either. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
