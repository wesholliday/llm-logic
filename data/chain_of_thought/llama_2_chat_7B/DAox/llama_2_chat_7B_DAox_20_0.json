In this case, we want to know whether the fleeg did not surn.\nStep 3: To do this, we use the logical connector \"therefore\" to link the premises to the conclusion. So, if the first premise is true, and the second premise follows logically from it, then we can conclude that the fleeg did not surn.\nStep 4: Now, let's evaluate each premise:\nPremise 1: \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" - This premise is given as true.\nPremise 2: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" - This premise follows logically from the definition of bluttering and surning.\nStep 5: Based on the above evaluation, we can conclude that the fleeg did not surn. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
