This means that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\nStep 3: Use the logical relationship to deduce a conclusion\nUsing the logical relationship between the statements, we can deduce that if the wug was not garpled (according to the first statement), then it was not sproinged (since if it was sproinged, it would have been garpled). Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
