This means that if one of the events occurs (i.e., the glip is slogged), the other event must also occur (i.e., the glip is tragged).\nStep 3: Use the information to answer the question\nGiven the relationship between the two statements, we can conclude that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
