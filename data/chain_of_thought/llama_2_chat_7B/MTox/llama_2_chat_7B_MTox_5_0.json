Premise 2: If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (given)\n3. Inference: We can infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' from the given premises.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nIf the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled by definition of fraggling. However, we are given that the zinger was not smoogled. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled either, since if it was fraggled, it would have been smoogled.\nSo, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
