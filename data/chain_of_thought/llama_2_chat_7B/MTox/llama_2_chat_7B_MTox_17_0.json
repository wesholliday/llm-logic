Premise 2: If the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the flob was not skizzled.\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\nPremise 1: The flob did not move. This is a given fact, so it is true.\nPremise 2: If the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved. This is the argument being made, and it is logical. If something is skizzled (whatever that means), then it will have a certain property or behavior, which in this case is movement.\nBased on these two premises, we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
