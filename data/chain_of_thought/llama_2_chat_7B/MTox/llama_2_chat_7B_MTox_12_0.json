If the condition in S2 is true, then the conclusion in S2 will be true.\nStep 3: Apply the conditional statement to the original statement (S1)\nUsing the conditional statement from step 2, we can apply it to S1 as follows:\nIf the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint (S2)\nThe smip did not lup the zoint (S1)\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the smip was shripped, it would have luped the zoint. Since the smip did not lup the zoint, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\nStep 4: Answer the question\nBased on the reasoning above, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
