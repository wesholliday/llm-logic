Therefore, we can conclude that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played a different sport, such as tennis.\nStep 3: Apply the information to the conclusion\nGiven that Amy did not play tennis, we can logically deduce that Jeff did not play basketball. This is because if Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis, but since she did not play tennis, Jeff must not have played basketball.\nAnswer: yes",
