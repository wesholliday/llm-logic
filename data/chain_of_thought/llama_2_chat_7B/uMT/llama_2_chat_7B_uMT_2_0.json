However, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest (according to the second statement).\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the given statements\nWe can infer that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must be in the forest too. Since we know that the unicorn is not in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin is not in the forest either.\nAnswer: yes",
