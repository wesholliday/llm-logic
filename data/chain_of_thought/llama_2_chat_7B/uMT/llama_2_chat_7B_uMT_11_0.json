This is because the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" is a logical contradiction, and we cannot have both statements true at the same time. Therefore, if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake must have been something else, such as vanilla or strawberry.\nAnswer: Yes",
