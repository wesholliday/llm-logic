However, we know that Jen did not watch basketball, which means she must have watched something else. Since Tom watched football, it is possible that he also watched something else.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the given information\n\nWe can infer that Tom may or may not have watched football, as we do not know for sure. However, since Jen did not watch basketball, it is likely that she watched something else, which could be football. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
