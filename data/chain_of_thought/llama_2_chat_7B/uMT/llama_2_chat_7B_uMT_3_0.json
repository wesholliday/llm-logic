(Statement 2)\nStep 2: Analyze the statements and identify any contradictions or inconsistencies.\nStatements 1 and 2 are contradictory, as they both claim to be true about the same book, but one states that it is a mystery novel while the other states that it was not written by James.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the analysis.\nSince Statements 1 and 2 are contradictory, we can infer that either Statement 1 or Statement 2 must be false. Since we know that Statement 1 is true (the book was written by James), we can conclude that Statement 2 is false (the book is not a mystery novel).\nAnswer: yes",
