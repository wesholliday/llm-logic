Therefore, Alex finished the race (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and (2) Chris finished the race. The conclusion that follows is that Alex finished the race.\nTo determine whether we can logically conclude \"Alex finished the race\" from these premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. An argument is valid if its conclusion logically follows from its premises.\nIn this case, the argument is valid because the second premise provides additional information that confirms the conclusion. If Chris finished the race, then Alex must have also finished the race, since they are inseparable. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given premises.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
