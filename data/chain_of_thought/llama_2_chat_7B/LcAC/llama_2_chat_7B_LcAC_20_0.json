This rule allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises if both premises are true. In this case, we have two premises: the apple was red and if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. Since the second premise is true (the banana was yellow), we can logically conclude that the first premise is also true (the apple was red).\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
