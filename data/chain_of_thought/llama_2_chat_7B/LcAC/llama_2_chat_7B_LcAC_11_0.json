Conclusion: Therefore, the cake was chocolate.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake had the property of being chocolate, then the muffins must have had the property of being blueberry.\nThe second premise states that the muffins were blueberry. This means that the muffins actually had the property of being blueberry, which is the opposite of what the first premise would lead us to expect if the cake was chocolate.\nSo, based on these two premises, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
