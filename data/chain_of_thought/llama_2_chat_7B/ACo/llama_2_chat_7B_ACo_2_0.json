This implies that if one statement is true, the other statement must also be true.\nStep 3: Apply the logical connection to the given statements\nIf the first statement is true (i.e., \"The unicorn was in the forest\"), and the second statement is true (i.e., \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"), we can infer that the second statement is also true, i.e., \"The griffin was in the forest\".\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
