Premise 2: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (this is the conclusion we want to draw)\n3. Inference: We need to determine whether the argument is valid or not. To do this, we need to check if the premises logically lead to the conclusion.\n4. Checking the premises: Let's evaluate each premise separately:\na. Premise 1: Kate ate salad - This is a given fact, so it is true.\nb. Premise 2: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad - This is the conclusion we want to draw, and it is logically valid. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad, since she cannot eat both at the same time.\n5. Conclusion: Since the premises are true and the argument is logically valid, we can conclude that Ben ate pasta.\nAnswer: yes",
