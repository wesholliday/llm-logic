In this case, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would also be denim (by definition of denim). Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was denim if the pants were denim.\nStep 5: Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the argument is valid and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
