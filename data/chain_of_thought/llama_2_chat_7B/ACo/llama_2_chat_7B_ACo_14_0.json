Premise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (given)\n3. Inference: We can infer 'The bear was in the cave' (wanted to be proven)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n4. Evaluation: The argument is a valid form of reasoning known as modus ponens. This means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises, given their truth.\n5. Conclusion: Answer: yes, we can infer 'The bear was in the cave'.\nTherefore, based on the given premises, it is reasonable to conclude that the bear was indeed in the cave.",
