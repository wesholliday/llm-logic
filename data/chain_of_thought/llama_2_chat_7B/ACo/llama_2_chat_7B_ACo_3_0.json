Premise 2: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n3. Inference: We can infer that the book was written by James.\nNow, let me explain why I arrived at this conclusion:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the book is a mystery novel. From premise 2, we know that if the book was written by James, then it is also a mystery novel. Since the book is a mystery novel, and it would be true if the book was written by James, we can logically conclude that the book was written by James. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
