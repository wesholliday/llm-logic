Premise 2: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (given)\n3. Inference: We can infer 'The alien visited Mars' (wanted to be inferred)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether we can indeed infer 'The alien visited Mars':\nStep 1: Evaluating the premises\nBoth premises are given, so let's move on to the inference step.\nStep 2: Making the inference\nBased on Premise 2, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since we know that the robot visited Jupiter (Premise 1), we can conclude that the alien visited Mars (by modus ponens).\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
