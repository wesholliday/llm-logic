Conclusion: Therefore, the doll was not plastic.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. Premise 1 states that the truck was not metal, which means that it could have been made of any other material, such as plastic or wood. Premise 2 states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll is made of a material that is different from metal, then the truck must be made of metal.\nSo, if we combine these two premises, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
