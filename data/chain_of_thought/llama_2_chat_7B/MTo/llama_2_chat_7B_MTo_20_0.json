To do this, we use the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule states that if A implies B and A is true, then B must also be true.\nSo, applying modus ponens to our premises, we can conclude:\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (premise)\nThe banana was not yellow (premise)\nTherefore, the apple was not red.\nAnswer: yes",
