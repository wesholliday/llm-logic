This means that if Ben did eat pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad.\nStep 4: We are also given that Kate did not eat the salad (premise 1). This means that Kate did not eat the salad, regardless of whether or not Ben ate pasta.\nStep 5: Based on these two premises, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad. This is because if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad (premise 2), but since Kate did not eat the salad (premise 1), it means that Ben did not eat pasta.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
