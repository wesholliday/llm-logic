Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: the first premise states that Bob did not choose pasta, and the second premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. The conclusion logically follows from these premises, as if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, but since Bob did not choose pasta, it means that Sue did not choose pizza either.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
