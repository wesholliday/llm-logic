This means that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\nStep 4: We are given that Erin did not take a train. Therefore, we can conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\nStep 5: Based on the conclusion reached in step 4, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
