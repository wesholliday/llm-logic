This means that if we rub the match against a rough surface and create a spark, there will be a fire.\nStep 4: Consider the additional information provided in the question\nThe question asks whether we can infer that if the match is struck and has been soaked in water, then it will light.\nStep 5: Draw conclusions based on the available evidence\nSince the statement \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" holds true, we can conclude that if the match is struck and has been soaked in water, there is a possibility that it may still light. However, it's important to note that being soaked in water may reduce the likelihood of the match lighting.\nAnswer: yes",
