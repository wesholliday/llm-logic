It implies that there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between these two events.\nStep 3: Evaluate the additional information \"the medication expired\"\nThis additional information provides context to the original statement. However, it does not change the causal relationship between taking medication and feeling better. The expiration date of the medication does not affect the direct cause-and-effect relationship between these two events.\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that taking expired medication will still result in feeling better for the person taking it. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
