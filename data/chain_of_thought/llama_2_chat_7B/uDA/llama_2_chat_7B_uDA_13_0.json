If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nThis statement is a logical implication, meaning that if the car has a certain property (red), then the truck must have the opposite property (blue).\n2. The car was not red.\nThis statement is given as a premise, which means it is assumed to be true without proof.\n3. Can we infer that the truck was not blue?\nYes, we can infer that the truck was not blue because if the car was not red, then the truck must also not have the property of being blue.
