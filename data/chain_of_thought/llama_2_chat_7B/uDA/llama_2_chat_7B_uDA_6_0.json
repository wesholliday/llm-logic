Sue did not choose pizza. (Given)\n4. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (Logical inference)\nNow, let me evaluate the information based on the given assumptions and inference:\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue made one choice, Bob must have made the opposite choice. Since Sue chose pizza, Bob must have chosen pasta.\nSo, if Sue did not choose pizza (Assumption 3), then Bob must have chosen pasta (inference).\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
