This means that if Lisa purchased a red shirt, then it is necessarily true that Mark purchased a blue shirt.\nStep 2: Evaluate the conclusion of the argument\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\". To determine whether this conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the second premise \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" provides sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.\nAnswer: Yes",
