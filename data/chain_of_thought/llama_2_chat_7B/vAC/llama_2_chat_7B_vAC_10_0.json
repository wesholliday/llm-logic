This means that if the dog is inside some location, then the cat must be outside that location.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the second premise \"The cat was outside\" separately.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nIf both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So, we need to check if the argument is logically valid. A logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
