This means that if Sue selected pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise of the argument\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Bob chose pasta\". We need to determine whether this premise is true or false.\nAnswer: Yes, the second premise is true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument based on the premises\nUsing the transitive property of inference, we can conclude that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza.
