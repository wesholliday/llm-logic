In this case, since the second premise \"The banana was yellow\" is given, and the first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, it logically follows that the conclusion \"The apple was red\" must also be true.\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
