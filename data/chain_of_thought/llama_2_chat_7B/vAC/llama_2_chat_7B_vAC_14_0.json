A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The bear was in the cave\" does logically follow from the premises. If the bear was in the cave (premise 1), then the wolf was in the den (premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion that the bear was in the cave follows logically from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
