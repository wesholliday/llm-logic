If it is true, then the argument will be logically valid; if it is false, then the argument will be logically invalid.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Alex finished the race.\" This means that if the premises are true, then it must be true that Alex completed the race.\nAnswer: yes",
