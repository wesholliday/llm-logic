In this case, let's analyze the conclusion: \"The book was written by James.\"\nIf the first premise is true, then the author of the book is James.\nIf the second premise is true, then the book is a mystery novel.\nTherefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
