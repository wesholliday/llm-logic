In this case, let's analyze each premise and see if they are true or false:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\nThis premise is true.\nPremise 2: The muffins were blueberry\nThis premise is also true.\n\nStep 3: Determine the argument's validity\nSince both premises are true, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
