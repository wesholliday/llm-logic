This conclusion is based on the fact that there are only two possible locations for the remote control: the coffee table or under the couch.\nStep 3: Inferring 'The remote control is on the coffee table' (inference)\nNow, let's apply the conclusion to the premises: if either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch, then we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. This inference is based on the fact that we know the remote control cannot be hidden under the couch, so it must be on the coffee table.\nTherefore, my reasoning leads me to conclude:\nAnswer: yes",
