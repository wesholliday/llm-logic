This means that there is a direct relationship between Tom's watching football and Jen's watching basketball. If Tom does not watch football, it implies that he is not the one who is responsible for Jen watching basketball. Therefore, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\nAnswer: yes",
