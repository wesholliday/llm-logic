Conclusion: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n3. Premise 2: The griffin was not in the forest.\n4. Inference: If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\nStep 1: The premise states that the griffin was in the forest. This means that the griffin existed in the forest at some point.\nStep 2: The conclusion logically follows from the premise. If the griffin existed in the forest, then it is reasonable to assume that the unicorn, which was mentioned in the same sentence as the griffin, also existed in the forest.\nStep 3: When we are given new information (the griffin was not in the forest), we can use this to draw a conclusion about the unicorn's presence in the forest. Since the griffin was not in the forest, it is unlikely that the unicorn was also in the forest.\nNow, based on my reasoning, I will answer:\nAnswer: yes",
