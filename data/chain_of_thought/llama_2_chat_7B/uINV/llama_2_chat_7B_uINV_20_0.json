            "content": "Okay, let's break this down step by step:\nStep 1: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\nThis statement is a logical inference, meaning that if one thing (the apple) has a certain property (red), then another thing (the banana) must have a different property (yellow).\nStep 2: We are asked to infer whether we can conclude that \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. If the apple was not red, it means that the apple does not have the property of red. But what about the banana? Does the fact that the apple doesn't have the property of red imply that the banana also doesn't have the property of yellow?\nStep 3: Let's analyze the relationship between the two statements again:\nIf the apple was not red, it means that the apple has no property (red). But what about the banana? Does the fact that the apple doesn't have the property of red imply that the banana also doesn't have the property of yellow?\nAnswer: No. Just because the apple doesn't have the property of red, it doesn't necessarily mean that the banana doesn't have the property of yellow. The two statements are not logically connected in this way.",
