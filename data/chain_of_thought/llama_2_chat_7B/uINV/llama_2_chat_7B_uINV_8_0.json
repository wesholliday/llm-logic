Conclusion: Therefore, the mummy is not awake.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each premise:\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is because in the scenario provided, the vampire and mummy are traveling together, and they are both undead creatures that are capable of being awake or asleep. Therefore, if one of them is awake, it's likely that the other is also awake.\nPremise 2: The vampire is not awake. This is because the scenario states that the vampire is \"asleep,\" which implies that they are not currently awake.\nUsing these premises, we can conclude that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
