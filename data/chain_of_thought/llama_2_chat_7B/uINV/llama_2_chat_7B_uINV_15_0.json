This means that there is a direct relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\nStep 2: Analyze the information\nWe are given two pieces of information:\n* Sam took a plane\n* Erin took a train\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This is because if Sam did not take a plane, then there is no direct relationship between Sam's action and Erin's action, meaning that Erin could have taken a train regardless of whether or not Sam took a plane.\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
