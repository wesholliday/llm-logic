If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\nNow, let me think about the reasoning behind each step:\nStep 1: Ben ate pasta. This is the given information.\nStep 2: Kate ate salad. This is also given information.\nStep 3: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This follows logically from the previous two steps, as if Ben ate something, then Kate must have eaten something else.\nStep 4: If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. This is also logical, as if Ben did not eat something, then Kate would not have eaten something else.\nNow, based on my reasoning, I can confidently answer the question:\nAnswer: yes",
