This means that the sprocket is either cranked or not cranked (since daggling is the only other option).\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that the sprocket is either cranked or must be daggled. Since we have already ruled out the possibility that the sprocket must be daggled, this means that the sprocket must be cranked.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
