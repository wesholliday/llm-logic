Let's evaluate the second premise first:\n\"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\nThis premise is a statement of fact, and we can verify its truth by observing the situation. If Bob did not choose pasta, then the premise is true. Therefore, we can mark this premise as \"True\".\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated both premises, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\nIn this case, the conclusion of the argument is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" To determine whether this conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the argument forms a logical chain. If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, then the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
