In this case, let's analyze the conclusion of the argument: \"The book was not written by James.\"\nIf the first premise is true (i.e., if the book was written by James), then the second premise must be false (i.e., the book must be a mystery novel). Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
