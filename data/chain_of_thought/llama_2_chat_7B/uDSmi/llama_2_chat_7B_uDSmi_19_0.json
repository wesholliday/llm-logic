This means that there are two possible scenarios:\nScenario 1: The watch is charging on the dresser.\nScenario 2: The watch is not on his wrist.\nStep 2: Evaluate the information\nWe cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on the fact that it might not be on his wrist. This is because we do not know the current location of the watch. It could be on his wrist, or it could be somewhere else entirely.\nStep 3: Conclude the answer\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer that the watch is charging on the dresser?\" is \"Answer: no\".",
