This means that the notebook could be in neither location (i.e., it could be somewhere else entirely).\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that the notebook is in the drawer. The statement \"the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in either location (i.e., it could be somewhere else entirely). Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
