This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can deduce that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Since Fido is not necessarily in the garden, we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
