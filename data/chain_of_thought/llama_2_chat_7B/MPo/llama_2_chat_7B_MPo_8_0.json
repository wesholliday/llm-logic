Premise 2: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (logical implication)\n3. Conclusion: The mummy was awake (inference)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\n1. Premise 1: The vampire was awake - This is the given information that we are working with.\n2. Premise 2: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake - This is a logical implication based on the fact that both the vampire and the mummy are supernatural beings that can only be awake during certain times of the year.\n3. Conclusion: The mummy was awake - Based on the premises, it follows logically that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. Therefore, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: Yes",
