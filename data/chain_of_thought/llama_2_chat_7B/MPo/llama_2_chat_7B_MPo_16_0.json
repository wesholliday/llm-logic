Therefore, if the pants were made of the same type of fabric as the shirt, they would also be cotton.\nSo, the conclusion \"The pants were denim\" cannot be inferred from the given premises. The inference \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is invalid because it jumps from a specific type of fabric (cotton) to a different type of fabric (denim).\nAnswer: no",
