In other words, we want to know whether the shank is in one of these two states.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nWe have two premises, each of which is a negation of the other. This means that if one premise is true, the other must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that either both premises are false or at least one of them is true.\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nSince at least one of the premises is true (by definition of negation), we can infer that the shank is plooked. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
