Premise 1: \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\" - This premise implies that there is no necessary relationship between the smip and being lupped.\n2. Premise 2: \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" - This premise implies that there are only two possible scenarios for the smip: either it must be lupped, or it is shripped.\n3.
