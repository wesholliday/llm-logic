Premise 2: It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n3. Conclusion: The sprocket is cranked.\nNow, let me explain why I arrive at this conclusion:\nFrom premise 1, we know that there are only two possible states for the sprocket: either it must be daggled or it is cranked. Since it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (according to premise 2), the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically.\nAnswer: yes",
