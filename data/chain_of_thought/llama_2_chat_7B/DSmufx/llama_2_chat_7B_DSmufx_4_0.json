Premise 2: It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the fribble is snurgled.\nNow, let me explain why I think this argument is valid and lead to the conclusion that the fribble is indeed snurgled:\nStep 1: The premises are logically consistent. Both premises are true by definition, as we have been given no information about the nature of fribbles or their properties.\nStep 2: The conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the fribble must be crinked or snurgled, and it's not the case that it must be crinked, then the only option left is that it is snurgled.\nTherefore, my answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The fribble is snurgled'?\" is:\nAnswer: yes",
