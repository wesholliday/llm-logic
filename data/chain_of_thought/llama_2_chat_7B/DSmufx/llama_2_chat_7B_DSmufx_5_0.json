Premise 2: It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled (this is also given in the statement)\n3. Inference: From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on a logical inference, where we are trying to deduce a conclusion from two given premises. The premises state that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled, and it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. From these premises, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled, because if it were not fraggled, then it would have to be smoogled (by definition of fraggling). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
