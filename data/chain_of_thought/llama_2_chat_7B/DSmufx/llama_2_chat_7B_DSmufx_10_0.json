(Premise 2)\nFrom these two premises, we need to infer whether the conclusion \"The wug is sproinged\" follows logically.\nStep 2: Analyze the argument structure\nThe argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which means that the conclusion follows from either of the two premises. The argument can be represented as:\nEither P1 or P2 \u2192 C\nWhere P1 and P2 are the premises, and C is the conclusion (in this case, \"The wug is sproinged\").\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nWe need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. To do this, we can ask ourselves if the premises provide sufficient reasons to support the conclusion.\nIn this case, Premise 1 states that either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. This means that there are two possible scenarios: either the wug must be garpled, or it is sproinged.\nPremise 2 states that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we can conclude that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\nAnswer: yes",
