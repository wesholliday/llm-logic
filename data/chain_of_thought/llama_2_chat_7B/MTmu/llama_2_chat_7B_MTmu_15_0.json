It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (contradictory premise)\nNow, based on these two premises, we need to infer whether Sam took a plane or not. Here's my reasoning:\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\nHowever, the second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This implies that Erin did not take a train, which in turn means that Sam did not take a plane.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
