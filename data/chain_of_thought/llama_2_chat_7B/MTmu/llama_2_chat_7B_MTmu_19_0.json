It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (contradictory premise)\nNow, based on these two premises, we need to infer whether Tom watched football or not. Here's my reasoning:\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen's watching basketball follows logically.\nHowever, the second premise states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This implies that there is no logical connection between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.
