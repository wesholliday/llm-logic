It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and what they imply about Joe's visit to the park:\nIf Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe visited the park, it is necessarily true that Lucy visited the zoo as well.\nHowever, we are given that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This implies that Lucy did not visit the zoo, which in turn means that Joe did not go to the park either.\nTherefore, our conclusion is:\nAnswer: yes",
