The contrapositive is obtained by flipping the original argument around: \"If Amy must have played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\nStep 4: Now, let's apply this contrapositive to the given premises: If Amy must have played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\nStep 5: Since we are given that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
