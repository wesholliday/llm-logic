Premise 2: It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the apple was not red.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This is a logical inference, as red and yellow are colors that are often associated with each other in our minds.\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that there is no necessary connection between the apple's color and the banana's color. In other words, just because the apple is red, it doesn't mean that the banana has to be yellow.\nSo, based on these two premises, we can conclude that the apple was not red. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
