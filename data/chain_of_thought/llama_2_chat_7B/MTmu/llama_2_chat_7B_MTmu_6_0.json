It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (contradictory premise)\nTo infer a conclusion from these two premises, we need to follow the rules of logical reasoning:\n3. If the first premise is true, and the second premise is false, then we can conclude that the first premise is false.\nSo, let's evaluate each premise:\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (premise) - This premise is true.\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (contradictory premise) - This premise is false.\nNow, let me connect the dots:\nIf the first premise is true and the second premise is false, then we can conclude that the first premise is false. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'Sue did not choose pizza'?\" is:\nAnswer: yes",
