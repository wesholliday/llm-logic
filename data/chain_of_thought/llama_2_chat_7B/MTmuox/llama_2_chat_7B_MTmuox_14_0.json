The first statement (\"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\") is a negation of the second statement (\"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"). In other words, if the clug was not fleeked, then it did not must have been snugged.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the relationships between the statements\nUsing the logical connections established in step 2, we can infer the following:\n* If the clug was not fleeked (which is the case, according to the first statement), then it did not must have been snugged (which is also the case, according to the second statement).\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
