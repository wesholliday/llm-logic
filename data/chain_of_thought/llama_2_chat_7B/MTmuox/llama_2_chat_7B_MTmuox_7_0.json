This is because if it were the case that the whiffle must have tinked, then it would be impossible for it not to have tinked.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\nStep 4: Since we know that the whiffle did not tink, and if it were shanked, it would have tinked, we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
