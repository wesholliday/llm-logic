This is because if it were the case that the smonk must have plagued, then the second premise would be true by definition.\nStep 3: However, from the second premise, we can also infer that the smonk was vreebled. This is because if the smonk was not vreebled, then it would not have plagued, which contradicts the first premise.\nStep 4: Therefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the smonk was vreebled.\nAnswer: yes",
