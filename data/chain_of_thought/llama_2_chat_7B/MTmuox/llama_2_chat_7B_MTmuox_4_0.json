This is because if it were the case that the fribble must have crinkled, then it would be impossible for it to not have crinkled.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinkled. This is because if the fribble was not snurgled, then it would not have crinkled.\nStep 4: Now, we combine the two premises to draw a conclusion. If the fribble was not snurgled (inference from step 2), and if the fribble must have crinkled if it was snurgled (inference from step 3), then we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
