This is because if it were varnished, then it would have been plinked (according to the second premise). But since it was not plinked, it means it was not varnished either.\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked. This is because if it were plinked, then it would have been varnished (according to the second premise), but since it was not varnished, it means it was not plinked either.\nAnswer: yes",
