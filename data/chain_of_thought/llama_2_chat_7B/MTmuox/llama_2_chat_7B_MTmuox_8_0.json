This is because if it were daggled, it would have been mentioned in the first premise.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\nStep 4: Since we know that the sprocket was not daggled (inference from step 2), and if it was cranked, then it must have been daggled (inference from step 3), we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
