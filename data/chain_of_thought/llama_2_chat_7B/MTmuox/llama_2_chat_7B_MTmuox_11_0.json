The first statement is negating the idea that the flug must have been zimmed, while the second statement is implying that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion based on the statements\nUsing the information provided in the two statements, we can infer that if the flug was not blummed, then it was not zimmed. This is because if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, and since the first statement states that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed, we can conclude that the flug was not blummed.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
