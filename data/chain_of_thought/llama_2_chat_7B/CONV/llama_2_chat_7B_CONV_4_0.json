(Assumption)\nStep 3: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. (From the given argument)\nStep 4: If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. (By reversing the conclusion of Step 3)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that there is a causal relationship between the two events - if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. Therefore, we can infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien must have visited Mars.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
