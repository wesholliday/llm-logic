Conclusion: Therefore, the wolf is not in the den.\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\n1. If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear is present in the case, then the wolf must be present in the den.\n2. The bear is not in the case. This means that the bear is not present in the case, and therefore the wolf cannot be present in the den either.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the wolf is not in the den. Since the bear is not in the case, we can conclude that the wolf is also not in the den.\nAnswer: yes",
