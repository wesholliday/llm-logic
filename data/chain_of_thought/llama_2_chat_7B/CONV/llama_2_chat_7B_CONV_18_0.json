            "content": "Okay, let's break down the argument:\nStep 1: The premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is given.\nStep 2: We need to infer a conclusion based on this premise. In this case, we are trying to determine whether we can infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\nMy reasoning:\nThe argument is based on the principle of transitivity, which states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. In other words, if we can deduce B from the premise, and we can deduce C from B, then we can deduce C from the original premise.\nApplying this principle to our argument:\nStep 3: We know that \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that \"the truck was metal.\"\nStep 4: We also know that \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" is the conclusion we want to infer.\nTherefore, using transitivity, we can deduce that \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\nAnswer: yes",
