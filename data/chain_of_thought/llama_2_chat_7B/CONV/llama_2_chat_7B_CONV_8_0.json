Conclusion: If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake (inferred from premise 1)\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\nIf the vampire is awake, it means that the vampire is conscious and active.\nIf the mummy is awake, it means that the mummy is also conscious and active.\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\nAnswer: yes",
