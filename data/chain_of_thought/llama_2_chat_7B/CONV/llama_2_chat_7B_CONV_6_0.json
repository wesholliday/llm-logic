If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen something else (pasta), as they are mutually exclusive options.\nStep 2: ???\nReasoning: We want to infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. This is because we know that Bob and Sue are making their choices independently of each other, so if Bob chose pasta, it means that Sue did not choose the same thing (pizza).\nStep 3: ???\nReasoning: We can conclude that If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. This is because we have established in step 2 that Bob and Sue are making their choices independently of each other, and if Bob chose pasta, it means that Sue did not choose the same thing (pizza).\nAnswer: yes",
