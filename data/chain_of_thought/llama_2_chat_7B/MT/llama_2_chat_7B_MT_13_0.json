From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that the car was not red (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on a logical rule called modus tollens, which means \"denial of the consequent.\" It states that if the conclusion does not follow from the premises, then the premises must be false. In this case, we have two premises: the car was red (if it were true) and the truck was not blue (if it were true). Since the second premise is true, we can conclude that the first premise (the car was red) must be false. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
