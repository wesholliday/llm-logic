The mummy was not awake (premise 2)\nFrom these two premises, we can infer the following conclusion:\n3. The vampire was not awake (inference)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nIf the vampire was awake, then by logical extension, the mummy must also be awake since they are traveling together. However, we are given that the mummy is not awake, which means that the vampire cannot be awake either. Therefore, the conclusion that the vampire was not awake follows logically from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
