The pants were not denim (conclusion)\nNow, let me think about how this argument works...\nStep 1: We know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. This means that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants cannot be denim.\nStep 2: The pants were not denim. This means that the pants cannot be denim, which in turn means that the shirt must be cotton.\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, we can infer that the shirt was cotton.\nAnswer: yes",
