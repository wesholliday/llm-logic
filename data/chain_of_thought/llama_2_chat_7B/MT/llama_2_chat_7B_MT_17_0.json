Kate did not eat the salad (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and what they imply about Ben's behavior:\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. This means that if Ben had eaten pasta, Kate would have eaten the salad.\nKate did not eat the salad. This means that Kate did not fulfill her part of the condition in the first premise.\nSo, based on these two premises, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\nAnswer: yes",
