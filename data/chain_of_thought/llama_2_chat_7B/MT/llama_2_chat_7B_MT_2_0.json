The unicorn was not in the forest (premise 2)\nNow, let's evaluate the argument:\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (premise 1). This means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\nHowever, we are given that the unicorn was not in the forest (premise 2). This means that the griffin cannot be in the forest either, because if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\nTherefore, based on the premises given, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\nAnswer: yes",
