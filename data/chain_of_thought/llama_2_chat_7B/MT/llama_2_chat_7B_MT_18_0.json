From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that the doll was not plastic (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on a logical rule of inference known as modus tollens. In essence, if we know that if A is true, then B must be false, and we also know that B is false, then we can infer that A is false.\nApplying this rule to the argument, we have:\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (A)\nThe truck was not metal (B)\nSince B is false, we can conclude that A (the doll being plastic) is also false. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
