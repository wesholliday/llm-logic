Bob did not choose pasta (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and what they imply about Sue's choice.\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue made one choice, Bob must have made the opposite choice. In this case, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\nHowever, we are given that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that Bob did not make the opposite choice of what Sue chose. So, if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza.\nTherefore, based on the premises given, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\nAnswer: yes",
