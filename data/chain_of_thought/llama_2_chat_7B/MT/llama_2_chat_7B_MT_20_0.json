Conclusion: The apple was not red (inferred from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, according to premise 2. But we know that the banana was not yellow, according to premise 3. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red, using modus ponens (a basic rule of inference).\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
