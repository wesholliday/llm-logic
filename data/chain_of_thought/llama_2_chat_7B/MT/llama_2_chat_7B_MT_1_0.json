Premise 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (given)\n3. Conclusion: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding (logical inference)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument:\nIf Sue was not at the wedding, then we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding. This is because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too, by the transitive property of identity. Since Sue was not at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was not there either.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
