Mark did not buy the blue shirt (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other...\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa purchased something, Mark must have purchased the opposite color. In this case, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nHowever, we are given that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\nSo, based on these premises, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nAnswer: yes",
