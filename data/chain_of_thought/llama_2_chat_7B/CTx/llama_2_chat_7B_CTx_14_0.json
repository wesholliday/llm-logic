In this case, the premise \"If the clug was fleeked\" implies that the clug has a certain quality or state, and the premise \"then the clug snugged\" implies that there is another quality or state associated with the same clug. Therefore, if the clug did not have the second quality or state (i.e., it did not snug), then it must not have had the first quality or state (i.e., it was not fleeked).\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: yes",
