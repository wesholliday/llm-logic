We are asked to infer whether \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n3. To determine this, we need to consider the meaning of \"morphed\" and \"quanked.\"\n4. Based on the context, it seems that \"morphed\" refers to a change in shape or form, while \"quanked\" is some kind of action or event.\n5. Therefore, if the splat was morphed, it means that its shape or form has changed in some way.\n6. If the splat quanked, it means that some event or action occurred.\n7. Based on these definitions, we can conclude that if the splat did not quank, then it did not undergo any change in shape or form (i.e., it was not morphed).\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Answer: yes.",
