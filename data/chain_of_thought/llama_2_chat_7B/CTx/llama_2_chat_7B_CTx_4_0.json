            "content": "Okay, let's break down the argument:\n1. Premise 1: If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked (this is the given premise)\n2. Premise 2: If the fribble did not crinkle, then it was not snurgled (this is the conclusion we want to draw)\n3. Inference step: We are asked to infer that if the fribble did not crinkle, then it was not snurgled.\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\n1. Premise 1: If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinkled. This premise is given and is assumed to be true.\n2. Premise 2: If the fribble did not crinkle, then it was not snurgled. This premise is the conclusion we want to draw.\n3. Inference step: We are asked to infer that if the fribble did not crinkle, then it was not snurgled. This inference is valid because if the fribble did not crinkle, then it did not meet the condition of being snurgled (i.e., the fribble was not snurgled).\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
