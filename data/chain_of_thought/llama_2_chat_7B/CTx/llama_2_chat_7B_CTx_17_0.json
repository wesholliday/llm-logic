In this case, the premise \"If the flob was skizzled\" implies that the flob underwent a certain transformation or change. The second premise \"then the flob movated\" suggests that as a result of this transformation, the flob began to move. Therefore, if the flob did not move, it means that it was not transformed or changed (i.e., it was not skizzled).\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: yes",
