In this case, the premise \"the whiffle was shanked\" implies that the whiffle was hit with a sharp edge, which could cause it to tink. Therefore, if the whiffle did not tink, it means that it was not hit with a sharp edge, and therefore it was not shanked.\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: yes",
