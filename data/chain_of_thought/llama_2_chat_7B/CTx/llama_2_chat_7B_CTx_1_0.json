In this case, the premise \"If the flugel was blimmed\" implies that the flugel underwent a certain action (blimming). The second premise \"then the flugel was zargled\" implies that the flugel underwent another action (zargling) as a result of the first action. Therefore, if the flugel was not zargled, it means that it did not undergo the second action (zargling), which in turn means that it did not undergo the first action (blimming). So, the argument is valid and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
