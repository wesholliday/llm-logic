The statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" implies that the possibility of the flob being skizzled is not a necessary or essential condition.\n2. If the possibility of the flob being skizzled is not a necessary condition, then it means that the flob might not have been skizzled.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" based on the given statement.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
