The statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\"\n2. The word \"must\" implies a necessity or obligation. In this context, it means that the splat being morphed is not a necessary condition for any conclusion to be drawn.\n3. The statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility of the splat being morphed. It only states that it's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat might not have been morphed\" directly from the given statement. The statement only provides negative evidence that the splat must have been morphed, but it does not provide any positive evidence to suggest that it was or wasn't morphed.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: no",
