The statement is: \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\"\nStep 1: Identify the logical relationship between the two statements\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" is a negation of the statement \"The smonk must have been vreebled.\" In other words, the first statement means that it is not true that the smonk must have been vreebled.\nStep 2: Determine the logical implication of the two statements\nIf we assume that the smonk must have been vreebled, then we can infer that the smonk was vreebled. However, if we are told that it's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled, then we cannot infer that the smonk was vreebled.\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the logical implication\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The smonk might not have been vreebled.\"\nAnswer: yes",
