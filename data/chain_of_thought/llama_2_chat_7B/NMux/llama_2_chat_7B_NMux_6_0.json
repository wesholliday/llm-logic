The statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" implies that the possibility of the grommet being sploffed is not a necessary or essential condition for some other event or situation to occur.\n2. If the grommet was not sploffed, then it must have been in its original state (i.e., not sploffed).\n3. From the given statement, we can infer that the grommet might not have been sploffed (i.e., it is possible that it was not sploffed).\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The grommet might not have been sploffed'?\" is:\nAnswer: yes",
