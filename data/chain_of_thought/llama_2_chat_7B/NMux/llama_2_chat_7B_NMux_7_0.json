The statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" implies that there is no logical necessity for the whiffle to have been shanked. In other words, it's possible that the whiffle was not shanked.\n2. If the whiffle was not shanked, then it might not have been shanked. This is a logical possibility, as we cannot know for certain whether the whiffle was shanked or not.\n3. Therefore, based on the given statement and the reasoning above, we can infer that \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"\nAnswer: yes",
