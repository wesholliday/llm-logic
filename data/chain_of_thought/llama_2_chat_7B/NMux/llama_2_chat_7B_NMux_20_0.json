Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\nStep 1: Understand the meaning of the words in the statement\n* \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" means that it is possible or likely that the fleeg was not bluttered.\nStep 2: Identify the logical implications of the statement\n* If the fleeg must have been bluttered, then it is impossible or unlikely that it was not bluttered.\n* Therefore, if it's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered, then it is possible or likely that it was not bluttered.\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the logical implications\n* So, we can infer that \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" from the statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\".\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
