The statement is: \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shipped.\"\nStep 1: Identify the meaning of \"must\" in the statement. In this context, \"must\" means \"it is necessary or required.\"\nStep 2: Consider the meaning of \"shipped.\" Shipped refers to the act of transporting something from one place to another, usually by a vehicle or vessel.\nStep 3: Based on the given statement, can we infer that the smip might not have been shipped? To do this, we need to determine whether the statement provides enough evidence to support the inference.\nAnswer: Yes",
