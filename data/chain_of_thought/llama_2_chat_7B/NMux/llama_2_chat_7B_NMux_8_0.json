The statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" implies that there is no necessary connection between the sprocket being cranked and some other fact or situation.\n2. If there is no necessary connection between the sprocket being cranked and something else, then it is possible that the sprocket was not cranked.\n3.
