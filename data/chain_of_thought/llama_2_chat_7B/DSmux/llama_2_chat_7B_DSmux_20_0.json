(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion that can be inferred from the premises\nFrom Premise 1, we know that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. From Premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned. Therefore, we can conclude that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the fleeg is not surned (according to Premise 2), then it must be bluttered (according to Premise 1). Therefore, we can answer 'Answer: yes' to the question of whether we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'.",
