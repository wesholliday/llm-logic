This means that there are only two possible states of affairs for the fribble - it is snurgled or it is crinked.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we know that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This means that if the fribble is crinked, it is not because it must be crinked, but rather because of some other reason.\nStep 4: Since we have established that there are only two possible states of affairs for the fribble, and one of those states is that it is snurgled, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
