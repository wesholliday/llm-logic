(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion\nThe argument is trying to deduce a conclusion based on the premises given. The conclusion is:\nCan we infer 'The wug is sproinged'?\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nTo evaluate the argument, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, Premise 1 states that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. Based on these premises, we can infer that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\nAnswer: yes",
