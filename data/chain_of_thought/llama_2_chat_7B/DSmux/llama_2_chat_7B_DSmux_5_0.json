Premise 2: It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the zinger is fraggled.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The zinger is either fraggled or smoogled. This statement is given in the argument, and it means that the zinger can be either one of these two states.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This premise is also given in the argument, and it means that the zinger does not have to be smoogled.\nConclusion: Therefore, the zinger is fraggled. Based on the two premises, we can conclude that since the zinger is not smoogled (by definition of premise 2), then it must be fraggled (by definition of premise 1).\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
