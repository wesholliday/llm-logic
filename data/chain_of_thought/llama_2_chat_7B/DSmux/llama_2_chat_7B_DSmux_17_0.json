This means that there are two possible scenarios: (1) The flob is skizzled, or (2) The flob must be moved.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we know that it's not the case that the flob must be moved. This means that scenario (2) - \"The flob must be moved\" - cannot be true.\nStep 4: Since scenario (1) - \"The flob is skizzled\" - is the only remaining possibility, we can conclude that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
