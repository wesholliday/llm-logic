This means that there are only two possible scenarios: (1) the smip is shripped, or (2) the smip must be lupped.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that the smip is not necessarily lupped. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
