(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion that can be inferred from the premises\nFrom Premise 1, we know that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. From Premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. Therefore, we can conclude that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished by definition of \"varnish.\" Therefore, we can answer 'Answer: yes' to the question of whether the twonk is varnished.",
