    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the given information:\n* Coffee is the most popular morning beverage.\n* Tea is the second most popular morning beverage, and it is likely to retain the most morning drinkers if coffee does not retain them.\n* Soda is consumed much less in the mornings than coffee or tea.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument:\n\nThe argument states that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. To determine whether this conclusion follows from the given information, we need to evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Coffee retains the most morning drinkers.\nIn this scenario, tea will not retain the most morning drinkers, as the argument states. Therefore, soda will retain the most morning drinkers if coffee doesn't retain them. So, the conclusion follows.\nScenario 2: Tea retains the most morning drinkers.\nIn this scenario, coffee will not retain the most morning drinkers, as the argument states. However, since tea is consumed less in the mornings than coffee or soda, it is unlikely that tea will retain the most morning drinkers. Therefore, soda will retain the most morning drinkers if tea doesn't retain them. So, the conclusion follows.\nScenario 3: Soda retains the most morning drinkers.\nIn this scenario, neither coffee nor tea will retain the most morning drinkers, as they are both consumed less in the mornings than soda. Therefore, soda will retain the most morning drinkers if neither coffee nor tea retains them. So, the conclusion follows.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer:\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\nThe argument states that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Based on the given information and the analysis above, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers in any scenario where coffee or tea does not retain them. Therefore, the conclusion follows.",
