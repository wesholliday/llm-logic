    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the argument\nThe argument is based on the premise that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs among the three states, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. If Georgia does not add the most jobs, then it is likely that Tennessee will. Therefore, if Tennessee does not add the most jobs, it is likely that Missouri will.\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"it is likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will.\"\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nThe argument is logically sound, as it follows a chain of reasoning based on the premises provided. However, the argument is not necessarily true, as there are other factors that could influence the job growth in these states. For example, economic conditions, industry trends, and government policies could all impact the job growth in Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri.\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes",
