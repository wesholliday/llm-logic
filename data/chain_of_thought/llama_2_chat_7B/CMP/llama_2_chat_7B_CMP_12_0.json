Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

This is because if romances aren't #1, and thrillers aren't either, then the next most popular genre would be mysteries.\n\nStep 3: Reasoning for the conclusion\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the fact that the three genres are ranked in a specific order (thrillers > romances > mysteries) and if thrillers aren't #1, then the next most popular genre would be romances. However, since romances aren't #1, it means that the next most popular genre after thrillers is mysteries.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
