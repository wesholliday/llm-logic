Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the given information\nThe information provided states that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties, and based on recent polling, the Democrats are likely to gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly.\nStep 2: Identify the possible outcomes\nThere are three possible outcomes:\n1. Democrats gain the most voters\n2. Republicans gain the most voters\n3. Libertarians gain the most voters\n\nStep 3: Analyze the situation\nIf Democrats don't gain the most voters, it means that either Republicans or Libertarians will gain the most voters. This is because if Democrats don't gain the most voters, then it is likely that Republicans will, as they are the second-most popular party according to the polling data.\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided, it is likely that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will. This is because if Democrats don't gain the most voters, then the second-most popular party (Republicans) won't gain the most voters either, leaving Libertarians as the only remaining option.\nAnswer: Yes",
