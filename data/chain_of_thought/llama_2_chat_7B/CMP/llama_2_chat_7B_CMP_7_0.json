    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the given information\n* Tidal power is expected to generate the most electricity this year.\n* Solar power is the second-most likely source to generate the most electricity.\n* Wind power capacity is lagging significantly behind.\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion being drawn in the question\n\nThe question is asking whether it is likely that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the argument and identify any assumptions or biases\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that tidal power is expected to generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. The conclusion being drawn is that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will. However, there are no assumptions or biases mentioned in the question.\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument and determine whether it is valid or not\n\nThe argument is valid as it follows logically from the given premises. If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then solar power will, and if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will.\nStep 5: Provide a conclusion based on your evaluation of the argument\n\nAnswer: Yes",
