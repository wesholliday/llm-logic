Premise 2: Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry (given)\n3. Inference: We can infer that the cookies are in the jar (conclusion)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\nYes, the conclusion \"The cookies are in the jar\" does follow logically from the premises. Here's why:\n* If the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry (premise 1), then they must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry (premise 2).\n* Since we know that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry (premise 1), the only possible location for them is in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar (conclusion).\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
