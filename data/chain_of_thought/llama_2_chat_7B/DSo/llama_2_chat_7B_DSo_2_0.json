Premise 2: Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the book is on the shelf.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise tells us that the book isn't resting on the table, which means it must be either on the shelf or not on the shelf (i.e., resting on the table). The second premise tells us that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. Since the book can't be both on the shelf and resting on the table, we can conclude that it must be on the shelf.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
