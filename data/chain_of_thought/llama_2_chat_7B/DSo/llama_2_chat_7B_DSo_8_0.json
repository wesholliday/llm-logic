Premise 2: Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the remote control is on the coffee table.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises, which are both true statements. Premise 1 eliminates the possibility that the remote control is hiding under the couch, and Premise 2 tells us that the remote control must be either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. Since we know it's not hiding under the couch, the only remaining option is that it's on the coffee table. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically, and we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\nAnswer: yes",
