(Inference 1)\nStep 3: We are given two options: either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. (Option 1: Cookies in pantry, Option 2: Cookies in jar)\nStep 4: Since we know that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, we can eliminate Option 1 (Cookies in pantry). (Elaboration 1)\nStep 5: Therefore, the only remaining option is Option 2: The cookies are in the jar. (Conclusion)\nAnswer: yes",
