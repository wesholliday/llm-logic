This means that there is a possibility that the wug is not garbled.\nFrom the second premise, we know that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garbled. This means that if the wug is not garbled, then it must be sproinged.\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion based on the premises\nGiven the two premises, we can infer that the wug is sproinged. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
