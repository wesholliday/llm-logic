From \"The twonk might not be plinked,\" we know that it is possible for the twonk to not be plinked.\n2. From \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked,\" we know that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements: if the twonk might not be plinked (step 1), and if it must be varnished if it is not plinked (step 2), then we can conclude that the twonk is varnished.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
