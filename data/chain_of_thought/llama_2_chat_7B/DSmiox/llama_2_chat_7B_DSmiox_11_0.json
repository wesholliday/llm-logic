In other words, if one of the premises is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nBased on the premises provided, we cannot infer 'The flug is blummed' as the conclusion. The reason is that the first premise 'The flug might not be zimmed' implies that the flug could be in any state (including unzimmed), while the second premise only provides two possible states for the flug: blummed or zimmed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the flug is blummed based on these premises alone.\nAnswer: no",
