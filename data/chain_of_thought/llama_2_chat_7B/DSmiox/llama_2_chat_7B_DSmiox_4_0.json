From \"The fribble might not be crinked,\" we know that the fribble is not necessarily crinkled.\n2. From \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked,\" we know that either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinkled.\n3. If the fribble is not crinkled, then it must be snurgled.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
