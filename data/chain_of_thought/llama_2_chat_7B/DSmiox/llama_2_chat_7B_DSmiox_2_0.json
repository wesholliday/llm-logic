Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion that can be inferred from the premises\nFrom the first premise, we cannot conclude anything about the wug's bimming status, as it may not be bimmed.

This means that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\nAnswer: yes",
