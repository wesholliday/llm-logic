Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion that can be inferred from the premises\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spent. Since the second option is not possible (as the first premise states that the dreb might not be spent), therefore, the conclusion is that the dreb is vroombed.\nStep 3: Determine the answer\nAnswer: yes",
