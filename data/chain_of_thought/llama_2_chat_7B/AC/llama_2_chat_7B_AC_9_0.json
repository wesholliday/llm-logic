Mark bought the blue shirt (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and whether we can infer something new from them:\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa made a particular choice (buying the red shirt), Mark made an opposite choice (buying the blue shirt).\nMark bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark made a particular choice (buying the blue shirt), which is opposite to what Lisa did (buying the red shirt).\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the blue shirt.
