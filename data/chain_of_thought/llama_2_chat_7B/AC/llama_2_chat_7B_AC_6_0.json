(Step 1 and Step 2)\nFrom this information, can we infer that Sue chose pizza?\nTo answer this question, I will use the transitive property of inference, which states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C.\nIn this case, we have:\nA = Sue chose pizza (Step 1)\nB = Bob chose pasta (Step 2)\nC = Sue chose pizza (transitive property of inference)\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
