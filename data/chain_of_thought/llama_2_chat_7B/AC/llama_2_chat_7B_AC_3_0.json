Premise 2: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (given)\n3. Conclusion: The book was written by James (inference)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether we can infer 'The book was written by James' from the given premises:\nYes, we can infer 'The book was written by James' from the given premises. Here's why:\n* Premise 1 tells us that the book is a mystery novel.\n* Premise 2 tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n* By combining these two premises, we can conclude that if the book is a mystery novel (which it is), then it was written by James (since he wrote it).\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
