This means that if Joe did something (went to the park), then Lucy did the opposite of that thing (went to the zoo).\nStep 4: Lucy went to the zoo. This means that she did the opposite of what Joe did.\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have done something else, which means he didn't go to the park.\nAnswer: yes",
