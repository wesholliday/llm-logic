Premise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (given)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the bear was in the den (inference)\nNow, let me evaluate whether we can infer 'The bear was in the cave' from the given premises:\nIf the wolf was in the den, and the bear was in the cave, then the wolf and the bear were both in the same location (the den). Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'The bear was in the cave' from the given premises.\nAnswer: no",
