This means that the whiffle cannot be both shanked and tinked at the same time.\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to deduce a conclusion\nGiven the two statements, we can deduce that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. This is because if it is not tinked, then it cannot be both shanked and tinked, which means it must be only shanked.\nStep 4: Formulate a conclusion based on the deduction\nAnswer: yes",
