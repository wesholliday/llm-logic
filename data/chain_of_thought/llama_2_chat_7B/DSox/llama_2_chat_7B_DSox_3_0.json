From \"The splat is not quanked,\" we know that the splat is not in a state of being quanked.\n2. From \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked,\" we know that either the splat is in a state of being morphed or it is in a state of being quanked.\n3. Since the splat is not quanked (according to premise 1), we can conclude that it must be morphed.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the argument is: Answer: yes.",
