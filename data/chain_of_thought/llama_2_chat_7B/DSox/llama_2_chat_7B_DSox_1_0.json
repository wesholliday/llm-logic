From \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled,\" we know that either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n3. We are given two statements: \"The flugel is not zargled\" and \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\"\n4. Based on the first statement, we can conclude that the flugel is not zargled.\n5. Based on the second statement, we can conclude that either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n6. Since the flugel is not zargled (according to the first statement), we can conclude that it must be blimmed (according to the second statement).\n7. Therefore, our answer is: Answer: yes.",
