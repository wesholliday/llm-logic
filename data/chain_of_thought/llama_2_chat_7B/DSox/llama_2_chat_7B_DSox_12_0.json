From \"The smip is not lupped,\" we know that the smip is not in the state of being \"lupped.\"\n2. From \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped,\" we know that either the smip is in the state of being \"shripped\" or it is in the state of being \"lupped.\"\n3. Since the smip is not in the state of being \"lupped,\" it must be in the state of being \"shripped.\"\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the smip is \"shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
