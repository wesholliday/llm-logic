Red is the typical color of apples, while yellow is the typical color of bananas. Therefore, if an apple is red, it means that it is not yellow, and if a banana is yellow, it means that it is not red.\nStep 2: The banana was yellow.\nReasoning: This statement is given in the premise of the argument.\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\nConclusion: The apple was red.\nReasoning: If the apple was red (according to the first premise), and the banana was yellow (which we are given), then it follows logically that the apple must have been red.\nSo, based on the reasoning above, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
