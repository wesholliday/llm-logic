Premise 2: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the griffin was in the forest.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can deduce the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The griffin was in the forest. This is the first premise given in the argument. We don't have any additional information about this premise, so we will assume it is true for now.\nPremise 2: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is the second premise given in the argument. We are trying to deduce whether we can conclude that the griffin was in the forest based on these two premises.\nTo determine if we can deduce the conclusion, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two premises. If the first premise is true and the second premise is also true, then we can logically conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\nSo, based on the given premises, we can deduce the conclusion:\nAnswer: yes",
