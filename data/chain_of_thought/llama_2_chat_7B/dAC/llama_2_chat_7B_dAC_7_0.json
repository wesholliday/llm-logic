Therefore, Alex finished the race (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and (2) Chris finished the race. The conclusion that follows is that Alex finished the race.\nTo deduce whether Alex finished the race or not, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. Since both premises are true, the argument is valid. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\nAnswer: yes",
