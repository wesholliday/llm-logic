            "content": "Okay, let's break down the argument step by step:\nStep 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nReasoning: This statement is true because plastic and metal are mutually exclusive materials, meaning they cannot be used together in the same object. Therefore, if the doll is made of plastic, it means that the truck cannot be made of plastic as well.\nStep 2: The truck was metal.\nReasoning: This statement is given to us as a premise.\nNow, let's evaluate whether we can deduce 'The doll was plastic' from the given statements:\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (Step 1).\nAnd the truck was metal (Step 2).\nFrom these two statements, we cannot deduce 'The doll was plastic'. Why? Because the premise 'The truck was metal' does not provide any information about the material of the doll. It only tells us that the truck is made of metal, which does not necessarily imply that the doll is made of a different material.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
