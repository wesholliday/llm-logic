Mark bought the blue shirt (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and whether we can deduce Lisa bought the red shirt:\nIf Premise 1 is true, then Mark must have bought a different color shirt than Lisa. Since Premise 2 states that Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that Lisa did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought something else (not the blue shirt).\nSo, based on these premises, we can deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt:\nAnswer: yes",
