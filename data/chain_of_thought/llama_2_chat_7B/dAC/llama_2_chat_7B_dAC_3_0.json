The book is a mystery novel (conclusion)\nTo deduce whether we can conclude that the book was written by James, we need to analyze the premises and conclusion of the argument:\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis premise implies that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\nConclusion: The book is a mystery novel.\nThis conclusion is based on the premise and states that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\nNow, let's evaluate whether we can deduce 'The book was written by James' from the given premises:\nTo deduce 'The book was written by James', we need to use the following logical reasoning:\n1. If the book is a mystery novel (premise), then it was written by James (conclusion).\nUsing this logic, we can conclude that 'The book was written by James' based on the premises given.
