The truck was metal (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and whether we can logically infer the conclusion.\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll is made of a material that is different from the truck, then the truck must be made of a material that is different from the doll.\nThe truck was metal. This means that the truck has the same material as the doll.\nFrom these two premises, we can logically infer that the doll and the truck have the same material, which means that the doll cannot be plastic if the truck is metal. Therefore, the conclusion is:\nAnswer: yes",
