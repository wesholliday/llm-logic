We don't know if it's true or false.\nStep 2: This is a known fact. We can accept this as true.\nStep 3: This is a logical conclusion that follows from Step 1 and Step 2. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, since they are traveling together.\nBased on the above analysis, I conclude that we can logically infer 'Sam took a plane' from 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Erin took a train'. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
