Premise 2: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the griffin was in the forest.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can logically infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The griffin was in the forest. This is the given information that we are working with.\nPremise 2: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is the second premise that we are using to draw a conclusion.\nBased on these two premises, can we logically infer that the griffin was in the forest? Yes, we can. Here's why:\nIf the griffin was in the forest (premise 1), and if the unicorn was in the forest (premise 2), then it follows logically that the griffin was also in the forest (conclusion). Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
