Conclusion: Therefore, the cake was chocolate.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can logically infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The muffins were blueberry. This is a given fact, so it doesn't affect our conclusion.\nPremise 2: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This premise tells us that if the cake had a certain flavor (chocolate), then the muffins would have a different flavor (blueberry).\nSo, based on these two premises, can we logically infer that the cake was chocolate? Yes, we can! Here's why:\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nTherefore, the cake was chocolate.\nAnswer: yes",
