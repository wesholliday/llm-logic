Therefore, we can logically infer that Alex finished the race (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and (2) Chris finished the race. The conclusion follows logically from these premises, as if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well, given that they are in a race together. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
