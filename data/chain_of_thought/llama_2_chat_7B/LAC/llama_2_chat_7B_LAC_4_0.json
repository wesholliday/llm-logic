From premises 1 and 2, can we logically infer 'The alien visited Mars'?\nTo answer this question, I will use the logical connectives provided in the prompt:\n4. Using the logical connective 'then', we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (premise 1).\n5. Using the logical connective 'and', we can combine premises 2 and 4 to get 'The robot visited Jupiter and the alien visited Mars'.\n6. Now, using the logical connective 'therefore', we can infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars (premise 5).\n7. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
