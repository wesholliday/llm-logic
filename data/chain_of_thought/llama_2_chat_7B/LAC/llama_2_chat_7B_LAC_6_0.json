(Step 1 and Step 2)\nFrom this information, can we logically infer that Sue chose pizza?\nTo answer this question, I will consider the logical implications of the given premises. If Bob chose pasta, then it is possible that Sue chose pizza. However, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza with absolute certainty because there could be other factors at play. For example, maybe Bob and Sue both chose pasta, or maybe they chose different types of food altogether.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: no",
