In this case, let's analyze the conclusion: \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\"\nIf we fertilize the lawn, it may or may not lead to a lush and green appearance, depending on various factors such as soil quality, watering, and weather conditions. However, if there is a drought, it is highly unlikely that the lawn will remain lush and green, regardless of whether we fertilize it or not.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" is not logically valid. The argument relies on an unrealistic assumption that fertilizing the lawn will always result in a lush and green appearance, even when there are external factors that can negate this outcome.\nAnswer: no",
