            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe argument has two premises:\nPremise 1: If I water the plants, they will grow.\nPremise 2: If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\nStep 2: Determine whether each premise is true or false.\nPremise 1: True. Watering plants can lead to their growth.\nPremise 2: False. Watering plants without sunlight may not lead to their growth, as sunlight is also necessary for plant growth.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument based on the premises.\nThe argument is logically invalid because the second premise contradicts the first premise. If watering plants leads to their growth (premise 1), then it should not matter whether there is sunlight or not (premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\nAnswer: No",
