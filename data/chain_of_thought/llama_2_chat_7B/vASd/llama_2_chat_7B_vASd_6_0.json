The first premise establishes a general relationship between screaming and hurting someone's ears, while the second premise provides a specific exception to this rule by stating that if the person making the noise is wearing earplugs, then it will not hurt their ears. This allows us to conclude that if the person making the noise is wearing earplugs, it will not hurt their ears, which is the conclusion of the argument.",
