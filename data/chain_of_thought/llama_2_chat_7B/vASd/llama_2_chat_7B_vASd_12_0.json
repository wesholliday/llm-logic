The second premise does not provide enough information to justify the conclusion. Even if my computer catches on fire, it does not necessarily mean that I can play video games. There may be other factors to consider, such as safety concerns or alternative ways to access video games. Therefore, the argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
