A syllogism consists of three parts:\n1. All A are B.\n2. Some C are B.\n3. Therefore, some A are C.\nIn this case, the argument can be represented as follows:\nPremise 1: If the match is struck, then it will light (All A are B).\nPremise 2: If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light (Some C are B).\nConclusion: Therefore, some matches have been soaked in water (Some A are C).\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\nBased on the evaluation in step 3, we can determine that the argument is valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises using logical reasoning. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Is this form of argument logically valid?\" is:\nAnswer: yes",
