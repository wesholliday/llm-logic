However, this does not necessarily follow from the first premise. Just because taking medication can make someone feel better, it doesn't mean that taking expired medication will have the same effect. In fact, taking expired medication could potentially be harmful or ineffective, which would undermine the conclusion of the argument. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
