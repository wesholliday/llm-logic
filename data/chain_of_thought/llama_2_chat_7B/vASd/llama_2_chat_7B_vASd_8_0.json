If the package has been shipped, it will likely arrive at its destination on the scheduled delivery date.\nPremise 2: False. If the package was misrouted, it may not arrive today, even if it has been shipped.\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is logically valid based on the premises.\nAn argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, the conclusion \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" does not necessarily follow from the premises. The conclusion depends on the additional assumption that the package will still arrive today even if it was misrouted, which is not guaranteed.\nAnswer: no",
