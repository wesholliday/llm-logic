The premise \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" implies that there are only two possible states for the zinger: smoogled or fraggled.\n2. The premise \"The zinger might not be smoogled\" suggests that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled.\n3. If the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled by definition of the terms.\n4. Therefore, if the zinger might not be smoogled, we can infer that it is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
