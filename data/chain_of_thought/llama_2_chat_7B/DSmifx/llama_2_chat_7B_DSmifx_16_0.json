If the snow is spread, then it cannot be cramped; if it is cramped, then it cannot be spread.\nStep 2: The argument also states that the sneg might not be spread.\nReasoning: This statement implies that there is a possibility that the snow is not spread, which means that it could be cramped.\nStep 3: Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that if the snow is not spread, then it must be cramped.\nReasoning: If the snow is not spread, then it cannot be both spread and cramped at the same time. Therefore, if the snow is not spread, then it must be cramped.\nAnswer: Yes",
