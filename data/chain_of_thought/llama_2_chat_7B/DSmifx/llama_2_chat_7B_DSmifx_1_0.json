Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed: This statement is a logical contradiction, as these two options are mutually exclusive. If the flugel is zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, and vice versa.\n2. The flugel might not be zargled: This statement implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n3. From 1 and 2, we can infer 'The flugel is blimmed': If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed by default. Since we know that the flugel might not be zargled, we can conclude that it is blimmed.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
