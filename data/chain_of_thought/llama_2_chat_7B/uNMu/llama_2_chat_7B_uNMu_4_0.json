While it is possible that the alien did visit Mars, it is also possible that it did not. Therefore, our answer should be based on the information provided and not on any assumptions about the alien's travel plans.\nStep 4: Formulate an answer\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty whether the alien visited Mars or not. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
