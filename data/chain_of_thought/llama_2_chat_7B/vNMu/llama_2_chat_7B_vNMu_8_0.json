The premises do provide enough information to support the conclusion that the vampire might not have been awake. The first premise negates the idea that the vampire must have been awake, and the second premise provides a possible alternative state of affairs (i.e., the vampire might not have been awake). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.",
