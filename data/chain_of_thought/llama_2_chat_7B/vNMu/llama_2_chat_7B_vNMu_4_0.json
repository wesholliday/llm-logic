The premises do provide enough evidence to support the conclusion that the alien might not have visited Mars. The first premise rules out the possibility that the alien must have visited Mars, and the second premise provides a reason why the alien might not have visited Mars (i.e., the alien might not have wanted to). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.",
