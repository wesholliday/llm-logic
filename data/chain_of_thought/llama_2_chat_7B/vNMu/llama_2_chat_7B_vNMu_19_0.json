The premises do provide enough information to support the conclusion that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\nExplanation: The first premise negates the idea that the watch must be charging on the dresser, which leaves open the possibility that it might not be charging there. The second premise provides additional evidence against the idea that the watch is charging on the dresser, as it suggests that the watch might not be charging anywhere. Together, the two premises provide sufficient reason to conclude that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.",
