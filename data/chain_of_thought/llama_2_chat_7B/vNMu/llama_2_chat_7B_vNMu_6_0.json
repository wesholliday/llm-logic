In other words, there may be other possibilities that could explain the conclusion even if the premises are true.\nIn this case, let's consider the possibility that Sue might have chosen pizza despite not having to do so. This means that the conclusion \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" is not necessarily true, as there could be other explanations for why Sue did or didn't choose pizza.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the argument is invalid, as the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\nAnswer: no",
