To answer this, we need to consider the information provided in the context of the story.\nStep 2: Analyze the context\nIn the story, it is mentioned that the vampire was not seen during the day. This suggests that the vampire may have been asleep or in a state of hibernation during the daytime. However, it does not explicitly state that the vampire must have been awake at night.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the vampire must have been awake. The story only mentions that the vampire was not seen during the day, which could mean that it was asleep or in a state of hibernation. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: no'.",
