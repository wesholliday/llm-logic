To answer this, we need to consider the information provided in the question.\nStep 2: Identify the premises\nThe premise is \"the griffin might not have been in the forest.\" This means that it's possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the premise, we can conclude that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This is because if the griffin might not have been in the forest, then it's not necessarily true that it must have been in the forest.\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: yes",
