If the premise is true, then the conclusion follows logically. However, if the premise is false, then the conclusion does not follow.\nIn this case, the premise \"The milk might not be on the counter\" is a possibility, but it's not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter based solely on this premise.\nAnswer: no",
