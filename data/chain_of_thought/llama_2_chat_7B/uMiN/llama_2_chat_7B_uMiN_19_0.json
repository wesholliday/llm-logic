The premise suggests that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, which means it could be anywhere else. However, this does not necessarily mean that the watch must be charging somewhere else on the dresser. It's possible that the watch is simply not charging at all, or that it's charging but not on the dresser.\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that it's not necessarily true that the watch must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
