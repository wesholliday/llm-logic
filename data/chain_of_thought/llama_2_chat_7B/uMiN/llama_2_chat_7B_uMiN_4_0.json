To answer this, we need to consider the information provided in the question and any additional assumptions we make.\nStep 2: Identify the assumptions\nWe are assuming that the alien has not visited Mars. This is the opposite of what we want to infer, so we will need to find evidence that contradicts this assumption.\nStep 3: Look for evidence\nSince we are assuming that the alien has not visited Mars, we can infer that there is no evidence of an alien visiting Mars. Therefore, we can say that it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided and our assumptions, we can conclude that it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
