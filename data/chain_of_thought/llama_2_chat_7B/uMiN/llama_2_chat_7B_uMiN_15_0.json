In this case, the premise simply states that the shoes might not be in the closet, which does not provide any explicit evidence against the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nSince the argument is invalid, we can conclude that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\nAnswer: yes",
