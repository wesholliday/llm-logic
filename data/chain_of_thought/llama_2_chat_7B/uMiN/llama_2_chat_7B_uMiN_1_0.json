However, this premise does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Mary must not have been at the wedding. It's possible that Mary was indeed at the wedding despite not being present.\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
