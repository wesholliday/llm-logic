If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nThis statement is a logical inference, as plastic and metal are two different materials with distinct properties. Therefore, if the doll is made of plastic, it is likely that the truck is made of metal.\n2. The doll was plastic.\nThis statement is given in the question, so we can assume it to be true.\nNow, let's apply the inference from step 1:\n3. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nApplying the inference from step 1 to the given statement, we can conclude that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
