            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This means that if Lisa purchased a red shirt, it must be true that Mark purchased a blue shirt.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". We must determine whether this premise is true or false. If Lisa did not buy a red shirt, then the conclusion that Mark did not buy a blue shirt follows logically. Therefore, we can mark the second premise as \"True\".\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nAn argument is considered logically valid if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion that Mark did not buy a blue shirt follows logically and the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
