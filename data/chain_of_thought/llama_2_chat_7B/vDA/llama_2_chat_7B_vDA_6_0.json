This means that if Sue made a particular choice (pizza), then Bob must have made the opposite choice (pasta).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Sue did not choose pizza\". To evaluate the truth of this premise, we need to consider whether it is true or false. If Sue actually chose pizza, then the premise would be false, and the conclusion would also be false. Therefore, for the sake of this argument, let's assume that Sue did not choose pizza.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\nIn this case, the conclusion of the argument is \"Bob did not choose pasta\". To determine whether this conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, we can ask ourselves: If Sue did not choose pizza, then what did Bob choose? The answer is \"pasta\", which means that the conclusion is true.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
