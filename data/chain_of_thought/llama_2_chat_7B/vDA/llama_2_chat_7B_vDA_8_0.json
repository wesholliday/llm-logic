This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the truth value of each premise separately:\nPremise 1: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\nTruth value: True\nThis premise is based on a logical correlation between two entities (vampire and mummy) where if one entity is awake, the other must also be awake. This correlation is reasonable and can be assumed to hold true in most cases. Therefore, this premise is true.\nPremise 2: \"The vampire was not awake\"\nTruth value: False\nThis premise is the conclusion that we want to prove or disprove. If this premise is false, then the argument is invalid. Let's assume that the vampire was indeed awake.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth value of each premise, let's determine the validity of the argument:\nIf Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is false, then the conclusion must be true. Therefore, the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
