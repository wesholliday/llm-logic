            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then it is true that Sue attended the wedding as well.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" We must determine whether this premise is true or false. If Mary did not attend the wedding, then the conclusion that Sue did not attend the wedding follows logically. Therefore, we can say that the second premise is true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nAn argument is considered logically valid if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, since the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
