This means that if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have eaten salad.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Ben did not eat pasta\". We need to determine whether this premise is true or false. If it is true, then the conclusion that Kate did not eat salad follows logically.\nAnswer: Yes, the first premise is true. Ben did not eat pasta, so the conclusion that Kate did not eat salad follows logically.",
