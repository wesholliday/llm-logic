            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car had a certain property (i.e., being red), then the truck must have another property (i.e., being blue).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The car was not red.\" This means that the car does not have the property of being red.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nBased on the premises, the conclusion of the argument is \"The truck was not blue.\" This means that if the car did not have the property of being red (according to the second premise), then the truck cannot have the property of being blue.\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, since the car did not have the property of being red (according to the second premise), it is impossible for the truck to have the property of being blue (based on the first premise). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
