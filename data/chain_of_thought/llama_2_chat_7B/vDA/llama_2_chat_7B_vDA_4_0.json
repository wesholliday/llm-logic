This means that if the alien went to Mars, then the robot must have gone to Jupiter.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the truth value of each premise separately:\nPremise 1: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\"\nTruth value: Unknown (assume for now that this premise is true)\nPremise 2: \"The alien did not visit Mars\"\nTruth value: True\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow, let's determine whether the argument is logically valid based on the truth values of its premises. A logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have:\nConclusion: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\"\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Based on the truth values we assigned earlier, we can see that the conclusion does indeed follow necessarily from the premises:\nIf the alien visited Mars (premise 1)\nThen the robot visited Jupiter (premise 2)\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
