Let's evaluate the truth value of each premise separately:\nPremise 1: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\nTruth value: True\nThis premise is based on a logical implication, which means that if the first condition (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then the second condition (Erin taking a train) must also occur. So, this premise is true.\nPremise 2: \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\nTruth value: True\nThis premise is also based on a logical implication, which means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. So, this premise is also true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth value of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\nIn this case, the conclusion of the argument is \"Erin did not take a train.\" Based on the truth value of the premises, we can see that if Sam did not take a plane (premise 2), then Erin did not take a train (conclusion). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
