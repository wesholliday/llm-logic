This means that if Alex completed the race, then it is true that Chris also completed the race.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Alex did not finish the race\". This means that Alex did not complete the race, which in turn means that the first premise is false.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nSince the first premise is false, the conclusion \"Chris did not finish the race\" must also be false. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\nAnswer: yes",
