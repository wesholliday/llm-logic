This means that if the cake had been chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The cake was not chocolate\". We need to determine whether this premise is true or false. If it is true, then the conclusion that the muffins were not blueberry follows logically.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nIf the first premise and second premise are both true, then the argument is logically valid. In this case, since the second premise is \"The cake was not chocolate\", which means that the muffins were not blueberry, therefore the conclusion follows logically.\nAnswer: yes",
