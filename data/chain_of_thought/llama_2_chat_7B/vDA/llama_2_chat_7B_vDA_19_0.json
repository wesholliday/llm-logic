            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". This means that if Tom engaged in one activity (watching football), then Jen must have engaged in another activity (basketball).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe are asked to determine whether the argument is logically valid. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth value of each premise.\nPremise 1: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" - This premise is true. If Tom engaged in one activity (watching football), then it is reasonable to assume that Jen also engaged in an activity (basketball).\nPremise 2: \"Tom did not watch football\" - This premise is true. We are given that Tom did not watch football, so this premise is satisfied.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Jen did not watch basketball\". This follows logically from the premises, as if Tom did not watch football (premise 2), then Jen must not have watched basketball (premise 1).\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid\nA logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"Jen did not watch basketball\" logically follows from the premises \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Tom did not watch football\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
