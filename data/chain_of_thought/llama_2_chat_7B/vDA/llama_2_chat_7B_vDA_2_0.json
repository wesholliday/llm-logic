This means that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The griffin was not in the forest\". We need to determine whether this premise is true or false. If it is true, then the conclusion that the unicorn was not in the forest follows logically.\nAnswer: Yes, the first premise is true. The griffin is a mythical creature and does not exist in reality, so it cannot be in any forest. Therefore, the second premise is also true.\nConclusion: Since both premises are true, the conclusion that the unicorn was not in the forest follows logically. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.",
