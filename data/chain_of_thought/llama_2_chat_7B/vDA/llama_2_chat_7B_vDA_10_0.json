This means that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be outside.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the second premise \"The dog was not inside\" and see if it is true or false.\nIf the dog was not inside, then it means that the dog is not in the same location as the cat. So, the second premise is true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth value of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\nIn this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion \"The cat was not outside\" must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
