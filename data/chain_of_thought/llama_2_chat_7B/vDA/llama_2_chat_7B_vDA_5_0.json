This means that if Jeff engaged in one activity (basketball), then Amy must have engaged in the other activity (tennis).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Jeff did not play basketball\". We need to determine whether this premise is true or false. If it is true, then the conclusion that Amy did not play tennis must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes, the first premise is true. Jeff did not play basketball, so the conclusion that Amy did not play tennis follows logically.\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
