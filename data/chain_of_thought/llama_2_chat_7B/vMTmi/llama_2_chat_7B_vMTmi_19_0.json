This means that if Tom engaged in one activity (watching football), then it is necessarily true that Jen also engaged in a different activity (watched basketball).\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Jen might not have watched basketball\". This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, which contradicts the first premise. If Jen did not watch basketball, then it is not necessarily true that Tom watched football.\nAnswer: no",
