Therefore, this premise is not logically valid.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nSince one of the premises of the argument is not logically valid, the entire argument is not logically valid. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Is this form of argument logically valid?\" is:\nAnswer: no",
