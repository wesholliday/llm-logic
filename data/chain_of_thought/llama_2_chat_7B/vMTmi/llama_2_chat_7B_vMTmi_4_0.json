If the alien visited Mars, then by logical necessity, the robot must have visited Jupiter as well.\nPremise 2: \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\" - This premise is uncertain or unknown. We don't know for sure whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nSince both premises are either true or uncertain, the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
