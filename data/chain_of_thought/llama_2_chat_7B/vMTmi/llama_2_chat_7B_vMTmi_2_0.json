If the griffin is in the forest, then it logically follows that the unicorn, which is a creature that might be in the forest, must also be in the forest.\nPremise 2: \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" - This premise is uncertain or false. We cannot know for certain whether the unicorn was or was not in the forest.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nSince both premises are either true or uncertain, the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
