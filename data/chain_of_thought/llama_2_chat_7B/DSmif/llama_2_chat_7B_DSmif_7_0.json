The premise \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the umbrella: either in the closet or in the car.\n2. The premise \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n3. Therefore, if the umbrella isn't in the closet, it must be in the car.\n4.
