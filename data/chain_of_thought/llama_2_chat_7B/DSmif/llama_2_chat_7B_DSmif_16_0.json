Premise 2: The pen might not be on my desk.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the pen is in my bag.\nNow, let me explain why I think this argument is valid and leads to the conclusion that the pen is in my bag:\nStep 1: We know that the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag. This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\nStep 2: We are given that the pen might not be on my desk. This means that there is a possibility that the pen is in my bag, since we cannot rule out the possibility that it is not on my desk.\nStep 3: Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag. This is because if the pen might not be on my desk, then it must be in my bag, given the alternative.\nTherefore, my answer is: Answer: yes",
