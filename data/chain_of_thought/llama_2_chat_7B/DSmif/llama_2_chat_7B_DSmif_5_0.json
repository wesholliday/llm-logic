The statement \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" implies that there are only two possible locations where the cookies could be: the pantry or the jar.\n2. The premise \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n3. Therefore, if the cookies aren't in the pantry, they must be in the jar.\n4.
