Let's assume that \"krimp\" means something that is inside the zool.\nStep 2: What does \"the zool is zapped\" mean?\nNow, let's interpret what \"the zool is zapped\" means. Since \"zap\" is a verb that can have different meanings depending on the context, we need to consider all possible interpretations of this phrase. For example, it could mean:\n* The zool has been electrified or energized in some way.\n* The zool has been damaged or harmed in some way, causing it to malfunction.\n* The zool has been transformed or changed in some way.\nBased on the information provided, let's assume that \"the zool is zapped\" means that the zool has been energized or electrified in some way.\nStep 3: Can we infer 'If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked'?\nNow that we have defined \"krimp,\" \"zool,\" and \"zapped,\" let's see if we can infer the conclusion of the statement. Based on the information provided:\n* If the krimp is in the zool (Step 1), then it is inside the zool.\n* If the zool is zapped (Step 2), then it has been energized or electrified in some way.\nCan we conclude that if the krimp is inside the zool and the zool has been energized or electrified, then the snarf will be glonked?\nAnswer: yes",
