This means that if one of these two conditions is true, the other will necessarily follow.\n\nStep 4: Apply the reasoning to the new statement\n\nIf the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then we know that the frizzle is dinked. Therefore, by applying the previous statement, we can infer that the zarp will splunk.\n\nAnswer: yes",
