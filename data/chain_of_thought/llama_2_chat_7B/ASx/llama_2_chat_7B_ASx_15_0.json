This implies that there is a direct causal relationship between the glunk's snarbling and the blip's being floinked.\nStep 4: Determine whether the additional information provided in the question is relevant to the conclusion\n\nThe additional information provided in the question, \"If the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked,\" is not relevant to the conclusion drawn from the original statement. The relationship between the glunk's snarbling and the blip's being floinked is independent of any other factors, including the troon's state.\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nAnswer: yes",
