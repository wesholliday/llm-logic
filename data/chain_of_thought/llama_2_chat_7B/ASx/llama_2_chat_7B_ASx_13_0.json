In other words, if the quop is in the blarf, it will automatically become gloobed.\nStep 4: Determine whether the additional information provided in the question is relevant to the statement\nThe additional information provided in the question is \"If the blarf is twinkling.\"\nStep 5: Apply the reasoning from steps 1-4 to the additional information\nSince the additional information states that the blarf is twinkling, we can infer that the quop is also in the blarf. Therefore, applying the reasoning from step 4, we can conclude that if the quop is in the blarf and the blarf is twinkling, it becomes gloobed.\nAnswer: yes",
