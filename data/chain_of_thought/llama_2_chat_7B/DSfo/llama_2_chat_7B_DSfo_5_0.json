Premise 2: Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the cookies are in the jar.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise tells us that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry, which means they must be somewhere else. The second premise gives us two options for where the cookies could be: either they are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. Since the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry, the only other option is that they are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\nAnswer: yes",
