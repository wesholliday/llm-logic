Conclusion: Therefore, the muffins were not blueberry.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nThis premise is based on the assumption that if something has a certain characteristic (in this case, being chocolate), then it must have another certain characteristic (in this case, being blueberry). However, this assumption may not always be true, as there could be other factors at play. For example, maybe the cake was chocolate but the muffins were actually made with a different type of fruit.\nPremise 2: The cake was not chocolate.\nThis premise is based on the information provided in the argument. However, we don't know for sure if this is true or not. Maybe the cake was actually chocolate but the person making the argument didn't realize it.\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that we cannot infer 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' from the given premises. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
