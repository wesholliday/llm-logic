Premise 2: Mary was not at the wedding (assumed)\n3. Conclusion: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: Premise 1 states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Premise 2 states that Mary was not at the wedding. By using logical deduction, we can conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
