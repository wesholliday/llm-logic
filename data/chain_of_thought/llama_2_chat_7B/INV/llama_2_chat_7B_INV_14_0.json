Conclusion: Therefore, the wolf is not in the den.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This statement is true by definition. Bears and wolves are known to coexist in caves, so if the bear is in the cave, it's likely that the wolf is also in the den.\nPremise 2: The bear is not in the cave. This premise is given, and we have no reason to doubt its truth.\nNow, let's apply the logical rules of inference to draw the conclusion:\nIf Premise 1 is true, then Premise 2 must also be true (modus ponens).\nTherefore, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\nAnswer: yes",
