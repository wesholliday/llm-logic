Therefore, Jen did not watch basketball (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on the principle of transitivity, which states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball (premise 1), and not watching football implies not watching basketball (assumption). Therefore, if Tom did not watch football, it follows that Jen did not watch basketball, which means we can infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\nAnswer: yes",
