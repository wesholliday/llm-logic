            "content": "Okay, let's break down the argument:\n1. Premise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. Premise 2: The shirt was not cotton.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the pants were not denim.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nThis statement is true. If the shirt is made of cotton, it means that it is a natural fiber and will have certain properties, such as being breathable and soft. Denim, on the other hand, is a type of fabric that is made from cotton and has a specific weave pattern. Therefore, if the shirt is cotton, it is likely that the pants are also denim.\nPremise 2: The shirt was not cotton.\nThis statement is given in the argument. If the shirt was not cotton, then it must be made of a different material, such as polyester or silk.\nNow, let's apply the logical rules of inference to draw the conclusion:\n1. Modus ponens: If Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is true, then Conclusion must be true.\nTherefore, we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\nAnswer: yes",
