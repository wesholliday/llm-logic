Therefore, Amy did not play tennis (conclusion)\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion based on the premises:\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if there is any situation where Jeff plays basketball, Amy must also play tennis.\nSince Jeff did not play basketball, we can conclude that there is no situation where he plays basketball.
