The premise \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket is not daggled.\n2. The premise \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" implies that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n3. From 1 and 2, we can infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The sprocket is cranked'?\" is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
