In this case, since the premises are \"The sneg might not be sproted\" and \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\", we can see that if the sneg might not be sproted, then it must be crampled. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\nAnswer: yes",
