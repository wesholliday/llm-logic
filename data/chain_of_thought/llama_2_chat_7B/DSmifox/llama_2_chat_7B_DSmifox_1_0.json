From \"The flugel might not be zargled\" we know that it is possible for the flugel to not be zargled.\n2. From \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\" we know that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements: if the flugel might not be zargled, then either it must be zargled or it is blimmed.\n4. Since we know that the flugel might not be zargled, we can conclude that it is blimmed.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
