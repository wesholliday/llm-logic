From \"The zinger might not be smoogled\" we know that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled.\n2. From \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" we know that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n3. So, if the zinger might not be smoogled (step 1), and if it must be fraggled if it is not smoogled (step 2), then we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
