The conclusion is \"The glip is slogged.\"\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nTo evaluate the argument, we need to consider whether the premises are true or false. If one of the premises is false, the conclusion may also be false.\nPremise 1: The glip might not be tragged - This premise is neither true nor false, as it is a mere possibility.\nPremise 2: Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged - This premise is true.\nStep 4: Conclude\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that the argument is valid and the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
