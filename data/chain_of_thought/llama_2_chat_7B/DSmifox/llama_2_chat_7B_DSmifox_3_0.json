The premise \"The splat might not be quanked\" implies that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n2. The premise \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" implies that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n3. From 1 and 2, we can infer that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"The splat is morphed\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
