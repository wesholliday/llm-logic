Therefore, if Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that something cannot both be and not be at the same time. In other words, if Tom watched football, then it is impossible for Jen to have watched basketball. Therefore, if Jen watched basketball, it means that Tom did not watch football.\nSo, based on the argument above, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
