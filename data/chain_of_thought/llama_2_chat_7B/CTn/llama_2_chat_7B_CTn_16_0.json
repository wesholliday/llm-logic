Conclusion: Therefore, the shirt was not cotton.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\nReasoning: This premise states that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants cannot be made of denim. Denim is a type of fabric that is different from cotton, so if the shirt is cotton, it means the pants cannot be denim.\nPremise 2: The pants were denim.\nReasoning: This premise states that the pants in question are made of denim.\nNow, let's apply the reasoning from Premise 1 to Premise 2:\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim (Premise 1).\nSince the pants are denim (Premise 2), we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
