In this case, we can infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\nReasoning: The argument is based on the idea that if one fruit is a certain color, then the other fruit cannot be another color. For example, if the apple is red, then it is impossible for the banana to be red as well. Therefore, if the banana is yellow, it means that the apple cannot be red.\nAnswer: Yes",
