Premise 2: If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n3. Inference: We can infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises, which are logically connected by the word \"then.\" The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race. The second premise states that if Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race. By using the word \"then,\" we can infer that if one of the conditions is true, the other condition must also be false.\nTherefore, if Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\nAnswer: yes",
