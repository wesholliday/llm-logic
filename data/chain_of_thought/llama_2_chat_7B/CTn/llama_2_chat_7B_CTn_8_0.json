Conclusion: If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake (inferred from premise 1)\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\nIf the vampire is awake, it means that the mummy is not awake (by definition of a vampire). Therefore, if the mummy is awake, it means that the vampire is not awake (by transitive property of \"not awake\").\nSo, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first:\nAnswer: yes",
