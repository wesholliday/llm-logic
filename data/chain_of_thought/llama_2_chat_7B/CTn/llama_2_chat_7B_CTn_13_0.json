In this case, we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\nReasoning: If the car was red, then the truck cannot be blue because the premise states that the car and truck are mutually exclusive in terms of color. Therefore, if the car is red, the truck must be something else (not blue). So, if the truck is blue, it means that the car is not red.\nAnswer: Yes",
