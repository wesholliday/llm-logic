If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if one of the statements is true, the other statement must also be true.\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion based on the relationships between the statements\nSince it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
