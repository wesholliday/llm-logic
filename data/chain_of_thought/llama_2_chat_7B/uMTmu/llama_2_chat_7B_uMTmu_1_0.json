This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding either.\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that it is not necessarily true that Sue was at the wedding. This means that we cannot conclude that Sue was at the wedding just because Mary was not there.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can draw the following conclusion:\nIf Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue may or may not have been at the wedding.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
