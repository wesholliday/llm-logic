This means that if Ben had consumed pasta, it is necessary for Kate to have eaten salad as well.\nStep 2: Analyze the information provided\nWe are given two statements: (1) Ben ate pasta, and (2) Kate did not eat salad. From these statements, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta. The reason is that the second statement only states that Kate did not eat salad, but it does not imply that Ben did not eat pasta.\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided, we cannot conclude that Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: no'.",
