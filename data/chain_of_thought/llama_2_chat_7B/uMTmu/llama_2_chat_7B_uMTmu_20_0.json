The statement suggests that if the apple is red, it must be followed by the banana being yellow.\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" implies that there is no necessary relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. In other words, just because the apple is red, it doesn't mean that the banana must be yellow.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the two statements given, we can conclude that the apple was not necessarily red. This is because if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but since the second statement states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow, it means that the apple could have been any color other than red.\nAnswer: Yes",
