This means that if Tom engaged in one activity (football), then the second person (Jen) must have engaged in a different activity (basketball).\nStep 2: Analyze the information provided\nWe are given two statements:\n1. Tom watched football.\n2. Jen did not watch basketball.\nFrom these statements, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This is because the second statement contradicts the first statement. If Tom watched football, then it is unlikely that Jen watched basketball.\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football. This is because if he had watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball, but since she did not watch basketball, Tom must not have watched football.\nAnswer: yes",
