This means that there is a logical connection between the color of the car and the color of the truck. If the car is red, it implies that the truck must be blue.\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\nThe question also states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means that there is no logical connection between the color of the truck and any other color. The statement \"the truck must have been blue\" is not true, which implies that the truck could have been any color.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the car was red, then it's possible that the truck was not blue. This means that we cannot infer that the car was not red based solely on the fact that the truck must have been blue.\nAnswer: yes",
