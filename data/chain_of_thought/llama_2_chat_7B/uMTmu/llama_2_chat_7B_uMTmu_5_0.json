This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, Amy did not play tennis either.\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that it is not necessarily true that Amy must have played tennis. This means that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis, even if Jeff played basketball.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions and make an inference\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis either. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\nAnswer: yes",
