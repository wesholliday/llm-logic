The given statements are:\n* \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n* \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\nLet's break down the first statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest.\nNow, let's analyze the second statement: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This statement tells us that the unicorn does not necessarily have to be in the forest.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the given statements, we can draw the following conclusion:\n* If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must be in the forest (according to the first statement).\n* The unicorn does not necessarily have to be in the forest (according to the second statement).\nStep 4: Make a decision\nNow that we have analyzed the statements and drawn conclusions, let's make a decision based on the given information.\nAnswer: yes",
