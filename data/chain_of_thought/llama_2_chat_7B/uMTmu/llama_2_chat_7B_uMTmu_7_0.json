Also, it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\nLet's break down each statement separately:\nStatement 1: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\"\nThis statement implies that if Alex completed the race, then it is necessary for Chris to have completed the race as well.\nStatement 2: \"Also, it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\nThis statement contradicts the first statement, indicating that just because Alex finished the race doesn't mean that Chris had to finish the race as well.\nStep 3: Inferential reasoning\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not have to finish the race either. This is because if Alex didn't finish, then it's not the case that Chris must have finished.\nAnswer: yes",
