This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that it is not necessarily true that Erin must have taken a train. This means that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, even if Sam took a plane.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
