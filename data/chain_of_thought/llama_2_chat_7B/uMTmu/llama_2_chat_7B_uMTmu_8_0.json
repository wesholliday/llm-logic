The statements given are:\n* \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\"\n* \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\"\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\nLet's break down the statements and understand their meaning:\n* \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" means that if the vampire is awake, it implies that the mummy is also awake. In other words, there is a direct relationship between the vampire's state of being awake and the mummy's state of being awake.\n* \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" means that it is not necessarily true that the mummy is awake just because the vampire is awake. In other words, there is no direct relationship between the vampire's state of being awake and the mummy's state of being awake.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can draw the following conclusions:\n* If the vampire is awake, it implies that the mummy is also awake (direct relationship).\n* It is not necessarily true that the mummy is awake just because the vampire is awake (no direct relationship).\nStep 4: Answer the question\nNow, based on the conclusions drawn above, we can answer the question:\nAnswer: yes",
