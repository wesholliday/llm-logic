Premise 1: If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled (this is the given premise)\n2. Premise 2: The sprocket was not daggled (the conclusion we want to draw)\n3. Inference step: From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was not daggled.\n4.
