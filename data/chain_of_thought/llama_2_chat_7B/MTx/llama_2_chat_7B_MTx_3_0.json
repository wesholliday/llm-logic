This premise tells us that the splat did not quack, which means that it did not undergo any transformation (morphing).\nNow, let me think about how these two premises relate to each other...\nAh, I see! If the splat was morphed, it would quack. But since the splat did not quack, it means that it was not morphed. Therefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\nAnswer: yes",
