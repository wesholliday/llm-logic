From 1 and 2, can we infer 'The flugel was not blimmed'?\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate the argument based on the given premises.\nStep 1: Evaluate the first premise\nThe first premise states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. This means that if the flugel underwent the action of being blimmed, it would also undergo the action of being zargled.\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise\nThe second premise states that the flugel was not zargled. This means that the flugel did not undergo the action of being zargled.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the premises\nNow, let's see if we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' from the given premises. If the flugel was not zargled (premise 2), then it means that it did not undergo the action of being zargled. Since the flugel was not zargled, and if it was blimmed, it would be zargled (premise 1), we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
