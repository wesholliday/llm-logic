This means that if Alex completed the race, it is certain that Chris also completed the race.\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement\nThe question also states that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is a possibility that Chris did not complete the race, even if Alex did.\nStep 3: Inferential reasoning\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, since Chris might not have finished the race, we cannot conclude that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
