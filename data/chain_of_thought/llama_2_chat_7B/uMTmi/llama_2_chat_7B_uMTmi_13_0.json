This means that we cannot conclude that the truck was blue based solely on the fact that the car was red.\nStep 3: Inferential reasoning\nBased on the two statements provided, we cannot infer that the car was not red. The first statement implies that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, but the second statement introduces a possibility that the truck may not have been blue. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the car was not red based on these statements alone.\nAnswer: no",
