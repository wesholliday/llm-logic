Also, the muffins might not have been blueberry.\"\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\nFrom the first part of the statement, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. This means that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry.\nFrom the second part of the statement, we are given an alternative possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means that there is a chance that the muffins could have been something else entirely.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. However, since the muffins might not have been blueberry, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
