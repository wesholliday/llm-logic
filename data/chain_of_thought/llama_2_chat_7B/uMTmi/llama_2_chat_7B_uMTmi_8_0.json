Also, the mummy might not have been awake.\"\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This means that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy cannot be awake either.\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, even if the vampire was awake.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. However, since the mummy might not have been awake, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
