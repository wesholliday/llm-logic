If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten something else, since she cannot eat the same thing as Ben. Therefore, if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten salad.\n2. Kate might not have eaten salad.\nThis statement is also true. We don't know for sure whether Kate ate salad or not. She might have chosen to eat something else instead of salad.\nNow, let me think about the conclusion...\nIf Ben ate pasta and Kate might not have eaten salad, can we infer that Ben did not eat pasta?\nHmmm...let me see...if Ben ate pasta and Kate didn't eat salad, then...oh, I get it! Yes, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\nAnswer: yes",
