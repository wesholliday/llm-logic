If Mary is present, then Sue must also be present. However, the statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" introduces a possibility that Sue was not present.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the relationships between the statements\n\nGiven the information provided, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (logical implication). However, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding solely based on the fact that Sue might not have been there (absence of evidence does not imply absence).\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer to the question\n\nAnswer: no. We cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based solely on the information provided.",
