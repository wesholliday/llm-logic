It means that just because the apple was red, it doesn't necessarily mean that the banana was yellow.\nStep 3: Inferences\nBased on the two statements provided, we cannot infer that the apple was not red. The second statement only provides an exception to the first statement and does not contradict it. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
