This means that if Tom watched football, it is necessary for Jen to have watched basketball as well.\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement\nThe question also states that Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, even if Tom watched football.\nStep 3: Inferential reasoning\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, since Jen might not have watched basketball, we cannot conclude that Tom did not watch football. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: no'.",
