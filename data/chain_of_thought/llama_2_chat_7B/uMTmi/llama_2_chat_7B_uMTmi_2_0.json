This means that if the griffin is present in the forest, it implies that the unicorn is also present in the forest.\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement\nThe question also states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This means that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not present in the forest, even if the griffin was in the forest.\nStep 3: Inferential reasoning\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, since the unicorn might not have been in the forest, we cannot conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\nAnswer: Yes",
