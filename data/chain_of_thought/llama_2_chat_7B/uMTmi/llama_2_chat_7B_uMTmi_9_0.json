The phrase \"must have\" suggests a strong probability that Mark bought the blue shirt.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the given information\nGiven that Lisa bought the red shirt, and Mark must have bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark must not have bought the blue shirt.\nStep 4: Make a decision based on the conclusions drawn\nSince we have established that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark must not have bought the blue shirt, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
