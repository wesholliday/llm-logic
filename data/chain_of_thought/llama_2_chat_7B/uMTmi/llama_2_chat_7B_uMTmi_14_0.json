This means that we cannot conclude with certainty whether the wolf was or was not in the den based solely on the fact that the bear was in the cave.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the bear was in the cave, but we cannot conclude with certainty whether the wolf was in the den. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
