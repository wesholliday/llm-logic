Specifically, Sam took a plane, which means that Erin must have taken a train. This suggests that there is a connection between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's mode of transportation.\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\nGiven the information provided, we can consider two possible scenarios:\nScenario 1: Erin took a train.\nIn this scenario, Erin's mode of transportation is different from Sam's mode of transportation, which means that Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: no'.\nScenario 2: Erin did not take a train.\nIn this scenario, Erin's mode of transportation is the same as Sam's mode of transportation, which means that Sam took a plane. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: yes'.\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer to the question \"Can we infer that Sam did not take a plane?\" is 'Answer: yes'.",
