Premise 2: Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed (given)\n3. Inference: From Premises 1 and 2, we can infer that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed.\n4. Conclusion: Therefore, if the dreb is not spened, we can conclude that the dreb is vroombed.\nNow, based on my reasoning above, I answer:\nAnswer: yes",
