Premise 1: The wug is not bimmed.\nThis premise is given in the argument, and it means that the wug does not have the property of being bimmed.\n2. Premise 2: Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped.\nThis premise is also given in the argument, and it means that either the wug has the property of being bimmed or it has the property of being flooped.\n3. Conclusion: The wug is flooped.\nNow, let me think about how to use the two premises to reach the conclusion. If the wug is not bimmed (premise 1), then it must be flooped (premise 2). Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The wug is flooped'?\" is:\nAnswer: yes",
