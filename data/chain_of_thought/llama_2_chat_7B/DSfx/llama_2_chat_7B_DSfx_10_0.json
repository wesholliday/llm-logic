Premise 2: Either the wug is garbled or it is sproinged (given)\n3. Inference: From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that if the wug is not garbled, then it must be sproinged.\n4. Conclusion: Therefore, if the wug is not garbled, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged.\nNow, based on my reasoning above, I answer:\nAnswer: yes",
