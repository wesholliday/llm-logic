Conclusion: Therefore, the grommet is sploffed.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\n1. The premise \"The grommet is not plopped\" means that the grommet is not in a state of being plopped. This is a straightforward statement that does not provide any information about the grommet's state.\n2. The premise \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\" implies that there are only two possible states for the grommet: plopped or sploffed. This means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n3. Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The grommet is sploffed'?\" is yes.\nAnswer: Yes",
