Premise 2: Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the splat is morphed.\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\nPremise 1: The splat is not quanked. This statement is given in the argument, so we will assume it to be true for now.\nPremise 2: Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed. This premise implies that there are only two possible states for the splat: either it is quanked or it is morphed.\nConclusion: Therefore, the splat is morphed. Based on the given premises, we can conclude that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
