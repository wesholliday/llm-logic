Premise 2: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\n3. Conclusion: Chris finished the race\n\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: Alex finished the race and if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. The conclusion logically follows from these premises, as if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race (by definition of \"if\"). Therefore, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
