(This is given in the premise)\nStep 2: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (This is the conclusion we want to draw)\nNow, let me evaluate each step of the argument:\nStep 1: This is a given fact, and it's true.\nStep 2: We are trying to infer that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the fact that Lisa bought the red shirt.
