Conclusion: Therefore, the muffins were blueberry.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The cake was chocolate. (This is given)\nPremise 2: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. (This is the argument being made)\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. In this case, the argument is a logical deduction, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Therefore, the argument is valid.\nSo, based on the premises given, we can infer that the muffins were blueberry:\nAnswer: yes",
