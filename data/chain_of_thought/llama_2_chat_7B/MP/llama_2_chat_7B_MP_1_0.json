Premise 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (logical implication)\n3. Conclusion: Sue was at the wedding (inference)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\nPremise 1: Mary was at the wedding - This is a given fact, so it is true.\nPremise 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding - This is a logical implication, as if Mary was present, then by definition, Sue (Mary's friend) must also have been present.\nConclusion: Sue was at the wedding - Based on the premises given, it logically follows that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\nAnswer: yes",
