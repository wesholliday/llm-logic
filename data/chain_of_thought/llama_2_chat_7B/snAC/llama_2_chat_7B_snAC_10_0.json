In other words, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion based on the given statements\nGiven that both statements are true, we can conclude that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nStep 4: Verify the conclusion\nTo verify our conclusion, let's assume that the dog was inside. If this is the case, then by the first statement, the cat must have been outside. Therefore, our conclusion that \"The dog was inside\" implies that \"The cat was outside\" holds true.\nAnswer: yes",
