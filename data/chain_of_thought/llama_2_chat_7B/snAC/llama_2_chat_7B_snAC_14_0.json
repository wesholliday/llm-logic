It does not provide any additional information about the bear's location.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the given statements\nSince the two statements are independent, we can conclude that just because the wolf was in the den, it does not necessarily follow that the bear was in the cave. The bear could have been in a different location altogether.\nAnswer: no",
