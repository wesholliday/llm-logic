In other words, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and vice versa.\nStep 3: Apply the logical connection to the given statements\nWe know that both statements are true: \"Kate ate salad\" and \"Ben ate pasta.\" Therefore, we can apply the logical connection between the two statements to conclude that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\nStep 4: Determine the answer to the question\nBased on our reasoning above, we can conclude that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" implies that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
