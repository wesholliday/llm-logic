Premise 2: It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\nFrom these two premises, we can infer the following conclusion:\n3. Conclusion: The notebook is in the drawer.\nHere's how I arrived at this conclusion:\n* Premise 1 states that there are only two possible locations for the notebook: the nightstand or the drawer.\n* Premise 2 tells us that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which means it must be in one of the other locations (i.e., the drawer).\nTherefore, the conclusion follows logically: the notebook is in the drawer.\nAnswer: yes",
