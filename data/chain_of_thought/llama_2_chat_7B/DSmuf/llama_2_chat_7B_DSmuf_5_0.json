Premise 2: It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the cookies are in the jar.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: This premise is a logical disjunction, which means that either of the two options (hidden in the pantry or in the jar) must be true.\nPremise 2: This premise is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This implies that the cookies are not in the pantry.\nConclusion: Based on the two premises, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar. This is because if they are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
