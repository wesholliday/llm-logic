Premise 2: It is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the remote control is on the coffee table.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. The first premise suggests that the remote control could be hidden under the couch, while the second premise rules out that possibility. Since the first premise is false (the remote control is not hidden under the couch), we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
