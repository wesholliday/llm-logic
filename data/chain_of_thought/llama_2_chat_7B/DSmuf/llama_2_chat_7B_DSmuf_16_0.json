This means that there are only two possible locations for the pen - either on my desk or in my bag.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that the pen is not on my desk. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in my bag.\nTherefore, based on the reasoning above, I conclude that the answer is 'Answer: yes'. The pen is indeed in my bag.",
