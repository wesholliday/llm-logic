This is because the phrase \"or Fido is inside\" implies that these are the only two possible locations for Fido.\nStep 3: However, from the second premise, we can infer that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that Fido could potentially be inside, since being inside is not ruled out by the second premise.\nBased on these steps, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
