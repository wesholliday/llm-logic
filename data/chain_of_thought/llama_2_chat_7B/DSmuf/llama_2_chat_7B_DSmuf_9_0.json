Premise 2: It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\nMy reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:\nIf the missing puzzle piece must be either blending in on the floor or it is in the box, then it cannot be blending in on the floor, since we have established that it's not the case that it must be blending in on the floor. Therefore, the only possible location for the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\nSo, my answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
