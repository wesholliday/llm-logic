Premise 2: It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the sunglasses are in her bag.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise states that either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag. This means that there are only two possible locations for the sunglasses: either on her head or in her bag.\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the sunglasses are not currently perched on her head, which leaves us with only one possible location for them: in her bag.\nTherefore, based on the argument, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\nAnswer: yes",
