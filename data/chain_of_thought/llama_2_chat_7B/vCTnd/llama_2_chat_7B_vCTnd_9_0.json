Just because instructions were given does not mean they were not explained clearly. Instructions can be both given and explained clearly. Therefore, this premise is false.\nPremise 2: This premise is also false. Just because instructions were not explained clearly does not mean they were not given. Instructions can be given without being explained clearly. Therefore, this premise is also false.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument based on the truth value of its premises.\nSince both premises are false, the argument is logically invalid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
