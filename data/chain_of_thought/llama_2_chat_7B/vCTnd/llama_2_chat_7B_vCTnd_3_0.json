Conclusion: If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of this argument:\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.\nExplanation: The argument follows the correct form of modus ponens, which is a basic rule of logic. Modus ponens is a form of argument that takes the form \"If A, then B; A, so B.\" In this case, the premise \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\" implies the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" So, the argument is valid.",
