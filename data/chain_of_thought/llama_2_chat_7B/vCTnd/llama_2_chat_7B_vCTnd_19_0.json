            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe argument has two premises:\nPremise 1: If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\nPremise 2: If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\nStep 2: Determine whether each premise is true or false.\nPremise 1: True. If directions are provided, it means that someone has given instructions on how to perform a task or reach a destination. However, if the instructions are not clear, it means that the person may have difficulty understanding or following them. Therefore, if directions were provided, they were not explained clearly.\nPremise 2: False. Just because directions were not explained clearly does not mean that they were not provided. Directions can be provided in various forms, such as written instructions, verbal instructions, or even gestures. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is false.\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is logically valid.\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" does not follow necessarily from the premises. The argument is therefore invalid.\nAnswer: yes",
