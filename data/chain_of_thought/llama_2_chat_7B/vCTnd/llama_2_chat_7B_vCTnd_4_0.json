This is a valid premise as it is making a comparison between two opposite actions.\nPremise 2: If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\nThis premise is saying that if Ben did one thing (studied diligently), then he didn't do another thing (study). This premise is also valid as it is making a comparison between two opposite actions.\nConclusion: If Ben studied, then he did not study.\nThe conclusion is simply stating the same information as the premises, but in a more concise way. It is logically valid because the premises lead to this conclusion.\nAnswer: yes",
