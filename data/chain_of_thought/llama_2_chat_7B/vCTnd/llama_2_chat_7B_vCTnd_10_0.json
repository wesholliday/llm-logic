Conclusion: If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\nNow, let me evaluate the validity of this argument:\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful advice, which means that the advice provided was not useful or effective. The second premise then logically deduces that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered, because if the advice provided was helpful, it would have been offered.\nTherefore, I conclude that the argument is logically valid and its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises.\nAnswer: yes",
