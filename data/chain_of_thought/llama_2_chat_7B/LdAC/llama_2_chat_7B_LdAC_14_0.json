Premise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (This is the conclusion we want to deduce)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the bear was in the cave.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\n1. The wolf was in the den - This is a given fact, and it does not provide any information about the bear's location.\n2. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den - This is a logical consequence of the premises. If the bear is in the cave, then the wolf (which is in the den) must be near the bear (in the cave).\n3. Therefore, the bear was in the cave - This is the conclusion we want to deduce based on the premises.\nSo, my reasoning leads me to conclude that the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
