Mark bought the blue shirt (premise 2)\nNow, let's evaluate whether we can logically deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from these two premises:\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nMark bought the blue shirt.\nFrom the second premise, we know that Mark did indeed buy a shirt. Since he bought a blue shirt, it means that he didn't buy the red shirt (since there is no blue and red shirt). Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\nAnswer: yes",
