Premise 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (given)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, Mary was at the wedding (deduced from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument:\nThe argument is based on two premises, both of which are true. The first premise assumes that Mary was indeed at the wedding, while the second premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Given these two premises, it logically follows that Mary was at the wedding.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
