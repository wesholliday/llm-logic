It states that if A chose B, then if A chose C, then B chose C. In this case, A is Sue and B is Bob, and C is pizza or pasta.\nStep 4: Bob chose pasta (from Step 2) - This is the information that we are given in the argument, which we can use to deduce the conclusion.\nStep 5: Therefore, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza (conclusion) - Using the premise and the assumption, we can logically deduce that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. Since Bob chose pasta, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
