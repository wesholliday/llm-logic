Conclusion: Therefore, the vampire was awake?\nTo deduce the conclusion, we need to use the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule states that if A implies B and B is true, then A must also be true.\nApplying this rule to our argument, we have:\nA = If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (premise 1)\nB = The mummy was awake (premise 2)\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can deduce that:\nA implies B, and B is true, so A must also be true.\nAnswer: yes",
