(Step 2)\nThe pants were denim. (Step 3)\nFrom these two premises, we can logically deduce that the shirt was cotton. Why? Because if the shirt was cotton, and the pants were denim, then the shirt and pants must have been different materials. Since the pants were denim, it means that they were not cotton, which means that the shirt must have been cotton.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
