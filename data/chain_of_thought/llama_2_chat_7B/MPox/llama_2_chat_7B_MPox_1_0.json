The premise \"The flugel was blimmed\" implies that the flugel underwent some kind of modification or transformation.\n2. The conclusion \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" logically follows from the premise, as \"zargle\" is a possible outcome or result of the action of \"blimming\".\n3. Therefore, if we assume that \"The flugel was blimmed\", we can infer that \"The flugel was zargled\" based on the logical connection between the two statements.\nAnswer: yes",
