If the cat is playing in the bedroom, it cannot be napping on the couch, and vice versa.\nStep 2: The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\nReasoning: This statement is given in the question, and it eliminates one of the options (playing in the bedroom).\nStep 3: Based on the information provided, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\nReasoning: Since the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, and the other option (napping on the couch) is still available, it is the most likely scenario.\nAnswer: Yes",
