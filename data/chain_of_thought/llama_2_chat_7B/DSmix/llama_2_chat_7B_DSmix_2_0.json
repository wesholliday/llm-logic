Premise 2: Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed (given)\n3. Inference: From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\nHere's why:\nIf the wug might not be bimmed, then it could be either flooped or bimmed. Since we know that the wug must be one of these two things (either flooped or bimmed), and we know that it might not be bimmed, then it must be flooped.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
