The premise \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" implies that there are only two possible states for the sprocket: either it is cranked or it is daggled.\n2. The premise \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" suggests that the sprocket could be in a state other than daggling.\n3. Based on the first premise, we can conclude that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n4. Therefore, if the sprocket might not be daggled, we can infer that it is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
