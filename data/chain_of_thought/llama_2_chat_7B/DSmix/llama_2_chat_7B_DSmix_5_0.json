The premise \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" implies that there are only two possible states for the zinger: fraggled or smoogled.\n2. The premise \"The zinger might not be smoogled\" suggests that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled, which means it must be in one of the other states (fraggled).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled.\nAnswer: yes",
