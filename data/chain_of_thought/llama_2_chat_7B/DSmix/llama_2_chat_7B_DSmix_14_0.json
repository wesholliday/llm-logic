Premise 2: Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged (given)\n3. Inference: From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\nHere's why: If the clug might not be snugged, then it must be fleeked. This is because \"might not\" implies a possibility or uncertainty, while \"must\" implies a necessity or certainty. So, if there's even a small chance that the clug might not be snugged, then it's more likely that it is fleeked.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
