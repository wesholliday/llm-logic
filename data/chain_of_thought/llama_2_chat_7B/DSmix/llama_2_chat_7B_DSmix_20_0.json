Premise 1: Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\nThis premise implies that there are only two possible states for the fleeg: either it is bluttered or it is surned.\n2. Premise 2: The fleeg might not be surned.\nThis premise suggests that the fleeg could potentially have a state other than being surned.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the fleeg is bluttered.\nNow, let me explain why I think this conclusion follows logically from the premises:\nIf the fleeg might not be surned (premise 2), then it could have any state other than surned. Since bluttering is a possible state for the fleeg (by definition), we can conclude that the fleeg is bluttered.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
