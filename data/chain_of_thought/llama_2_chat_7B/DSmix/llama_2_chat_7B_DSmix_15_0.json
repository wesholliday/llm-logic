This means that there are only two possible scenarios: either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that the dreb might not be spened. This means that there is a possibility that the dreb is not spened.\nStep 4: Based on the above two premises, we can conclude that the dreb is vroombed. This is because if the dreb might not be spened, then it must be vroombed (since spening is not possible).\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
