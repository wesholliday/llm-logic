In this case, let's analyze the conclusion: \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\nIf the first premise is true, then the only possible location for the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor. Since the second premise states that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, the only remaining option is that it is in the box. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
