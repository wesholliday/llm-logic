The muffins were blueberry.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\nBased on the statements provided, we can see that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. This means that if the cake is not chocolate, the muffins cannot be blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Apply the reasoning to the second statement\nWe are given that the muffins were blueberry. Since we have established that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry, it follows that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the reasoning\nSince we have established that the cake was not chocolate, it follows that 'The cake was chocolate' is false. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: no",
