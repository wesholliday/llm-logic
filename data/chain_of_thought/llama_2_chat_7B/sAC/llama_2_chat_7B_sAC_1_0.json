Therefore, if Statement 2 is true, it means that Sue was at the wedding.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the relationships between the statements\nSince Statement 2 is true, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding. Since Statement 1 implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, and Sue was indeed at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was also at the wedding.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
