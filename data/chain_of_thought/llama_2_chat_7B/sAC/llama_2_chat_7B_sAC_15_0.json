If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, which means that if one event occurred (Sam taking a plane), the other event (Erin taking a train) must also occur.\nStep 3: Apply the logical relationship to the given statements\nNow, we need to apply the logical relationship between the two statements to determine whether \"Sam took a plane\" is true or false. If Statement 1 is true (i.e., if Sam took a plane), then by logic, Erin must have taken a train. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\nStep 4: Conclude the answer\nBased on the logical relationship between the statements, we can conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is true if and only if \"Erin took a train\" is true. In this case, both statements are true, so \"Sam took a plane\" is also true.\nAnswer: yes",
