In other words, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and vice versa.\nStep 3: Apply the logical connection to the given statements\nWe know that both statements are true: \"Kate ate salad\" is true, and \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is also true.\nStep 4: Conclude whether \"Ben ate pasta\" must be true or false based on the logical connection\nUsing the logical connection between the two statements, we can conclude that if Kate ate salad (which is true), then Ben ate pasta (which is the conclusion of the first statement). Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
