This means that if the vampire is not asleep, then the mummy is not asleep either.\nStep 3: Apply the first premise to the second premise\nSince \"The mummy was awake\" is true, we can apply the first premise and conclude that the vampire is also awake. This means that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\nAnswer: yes",
