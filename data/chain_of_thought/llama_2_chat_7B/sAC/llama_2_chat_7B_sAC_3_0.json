(Statement 2)\n\nStep 2:\nWe need to determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. To do this, we can use the logical connectives involved in each statement.\nIn Statement 1, the connector is \"then,\" which implies a causal relationship between the two clauses.\nIn Statement 2, the connector is \"is,\" which indicates a state of being or a fact about the book.\n\nStep 3:\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion based on the premises:\nIf the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\nThe book is a mystery novel (Premise 2)\nIf Premise 1 is true, and Premise 2 is also true, it follows that the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" must also be true.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
