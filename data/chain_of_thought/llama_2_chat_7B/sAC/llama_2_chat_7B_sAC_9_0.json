This means that if one of these events occurs, the other event must also occur.\nFrom Statement 2, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt.\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical reasoning\nUsing the information provided in Steps 1 and 2, we can apply the rules of logical reasoning to draw conclusions about the statements. In this case, we are trying to determine whether it follows that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true if \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt (this is the logical implication of Statement 1). Therefore, if Mark bought the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa bought the red shirt.\nAnswer: yes",
