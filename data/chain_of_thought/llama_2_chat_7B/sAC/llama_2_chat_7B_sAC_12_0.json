To do this, we can use a truth table or draw a diagram to visualize the argument.\nTruth Table:\n| If Joe went to the park | Then Lucy went to the zoo | Lucy went to the zoo | Conclusion |\n| True | True | True | Yes |\n| True | False | True | No |\n| False | True | True | No |\n| False | False | True | No |\n\nBased on the truth table, we can see that the conclusion \"Joe went to the park\" logically follows from the premises if Lucy actually went to the zoo. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
