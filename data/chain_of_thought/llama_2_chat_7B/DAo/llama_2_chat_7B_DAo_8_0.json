            "content": "Okay, let me break down the argument step by step:\n1. Premise 1: The vampire was not awake (given)\n2. Premise 2: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (given)\n3. Inference: We can infer that the mummy was not awake (conclusion)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the inference is valid or not:\nPremise 1: The vampire was not awake\nReasoning: This premise is given in the argument, and since it is a fact that the vampire was not awake, this premise is true.\nPremise 2: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\nReasoning: This premise is also given in the argument, and it makes sense since vampires and mummies are often associated with each other in fiction. Therefore, if the vampire is awake, it is likely that the mummy is also awake.\nConclusion: The mummy was not awake\nReasoning: Based on the two premises given, we can conclude that the mummy was not awake. This conclusion follows logically from the premises since if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy cannot be awake either.\nAnswer: Yes",
