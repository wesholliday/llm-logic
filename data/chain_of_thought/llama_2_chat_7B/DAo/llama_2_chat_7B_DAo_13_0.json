Conclusion: Therefore, the truck was not blue.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: the car was not red and if the car was red, then the truck was blue. If we assume that the first premise is true, then we can conclude that the second premise is also true, since the car was not red. Therefore, the truck cannot be blue.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
