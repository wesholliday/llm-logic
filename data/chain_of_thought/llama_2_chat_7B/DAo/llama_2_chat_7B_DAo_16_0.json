Conclusion: The pants were not denim (inference)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: \"The shirt was not cotton\" and \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" From these premises, we can infer that the pants were not denim. This is because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would also be denim, but since the shirt was not cotton, the pants cannot be denim. Therefore, the conclusion \"The pants were not denim\" follows logically from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
