Premise 2: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (given)\n3. Inference: We can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter (conclusion)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the inference is valid or not:\nPremise 1: The alien did not visit Mars - This premise is given, so it is true.\nPremise 2: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter - This premise is also given, so it is true.\nConclusion: We can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter - Based on the two given premises, we can logically deduce that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
