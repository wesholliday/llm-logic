The flugel was not blimmed (premise)\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic to infer a conclusion:\nIf Premise 1 is true, then Premise 2 must also be true, since the two premises are logically connected by the word \"then\". Therefore, if the flugel was not blimmed, it cannot have been zargled.\nSo, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
