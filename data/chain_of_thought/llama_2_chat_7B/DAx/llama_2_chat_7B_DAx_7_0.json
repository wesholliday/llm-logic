The argument can be represented as:\nConclusion: The whiffle did not tink\nPremise 1: If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\nPremise 2: The whiffle was not shanked\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nSince the premises are given, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows logically. In this case, since the whiffle was not shanked (according to Premise 2), we can conclude that the whiffle did not tink (according to Premise 1). Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
