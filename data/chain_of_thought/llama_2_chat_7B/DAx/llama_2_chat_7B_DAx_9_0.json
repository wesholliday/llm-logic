(Premise 2)\nNow, we need to use logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion based on the given premises. Let's analyze each premise:\nPremise 1: If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\nThis premise implies that if an action (plinking) is performed on a twonk, then a certain outcome (being varnished) will result.\nPremise 2: The twonk was not plinked.\nThis premise tells us that the action of plinking did not occur on the twonk.\nNow, let's apply logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion based on these premises:\nIf the twonk was plinked (according to Premise 1), then it was varnished (according to Premise 1).\nSince the twonk was not plinked (according to Premise 2), we can conclude that it was not varnished.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
