Premise 2: The smonk was not vreebled (the conclusion we want to draw)\nNow, let me apply the rules of logic to these premises:\n3. Modus Ponens: If P \u2192 Q, and P, then Q (from premise 1)\n4. Modus Tollens: If \u00acQ, then \u00acP (from premise 2)\n5. Combining steps 3 and 4, we get: \u00ac(P \u2192 Q) (i.e., the negation of the conclusion follows from the premises)\nTherefore, based on the given argument, we can infer that the smonk was not plagged, so the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
