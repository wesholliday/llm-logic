(Premise 2)\nCan we infer 'The wug was not garbled'?\nStep 1: Connect the premises\nWe can connect Premise 1 and Premise 2 using the logical operator 'then'.\nIf the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled. (Premise 1) -> If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled. (Premise 2)\nStep 2: Evaluate the argument\nWe have two premises, and we can conclude that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garbled.\nAnswer: yes",
