Conclusion: Therefore, the clug was not snugged (inferred from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\nPremise 1: The clug was not fleeked (given)\nReasoning: This premise is given, so it is assumed to be true.\nPremise 2: If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged (given)\nReasoning: This premise is also given, so it is assumed to be true.\nConclusion: Therefore, the clug was not snugged (inferred from premises 1 and 2)\nReasoning: If the clug was not fleeked (premise 1), then it cannot be said that the clug snugged (premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically.\nAnswer: Yes",
