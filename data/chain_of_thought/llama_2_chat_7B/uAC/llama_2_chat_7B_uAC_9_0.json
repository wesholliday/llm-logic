Lisa bought the red shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion based on the given information\nSince both Lisa and Mark bought clothes, it is possible that they may have bought the same color. However, we are told that Lisa bought the red shirt, which means she did not buy the blue shirt (since Mark already bought the blue shirt). Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the blue shirt, and hence, Mark bought the blue shirt.\nAnswer: yes",
