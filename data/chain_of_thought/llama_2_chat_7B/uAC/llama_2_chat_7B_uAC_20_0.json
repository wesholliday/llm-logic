While it is possible that the apple was red, there is no direct evidence to support this claim.\nStep 2: This is a known fact. We can safely assume that the banana was indeed yellow.\nStep 3: Based on the information provided in steps 1 and 2, we can logically conclude that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nNow, let me answer the question:\nAnswer: yes",
