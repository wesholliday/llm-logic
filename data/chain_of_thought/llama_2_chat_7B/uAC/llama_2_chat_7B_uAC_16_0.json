            "content": "Okay, let me break down the argument and explain my reasoning:\nStep 1: The shirt was cotton.\nReasoning: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of something else (denim). Since the statement specifies that the pants are denim, it means that the shirt cannot be cotton. Therefore, the answer to this step is 'no'.\nStep 2: The pants were denim.\nReasoning: This statement is given in the argument, and it does not provide any information that contradicts the previous step. Since the pants are denim, we can conclude that they are made of a different material than cotton. Therefore, the answer to this step is 'yes'.\nStep 3: Can we infer that the shirt was cotton?\nReasoning: Based on the information provided in steps 1 and 2, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton. This is because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would also be cotton (by the first statement), but since the pants are denim, the shirt cannot be cotton. Therefore, the answer to this step is 'no'.\nAnswer: Yes",
