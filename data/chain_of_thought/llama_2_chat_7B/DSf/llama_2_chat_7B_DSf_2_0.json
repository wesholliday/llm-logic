Premise 2: Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the book is on the shelf.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nStep 1: We are given two premises - the book isn't resting on the table and either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\nStep 2: From the first premise, we can infer that the book is not resting on the table.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can deduce that if the book isn't resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the book is on the shelf.\nAnswer: yes",
