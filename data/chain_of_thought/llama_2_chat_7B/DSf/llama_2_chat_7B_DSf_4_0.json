Premise 2: Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the cat is napping on the couch.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. From premise 2, we know that there are only two options for where the cat could be: either it's playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. Since the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, the only remaining option is that it's napping on the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\nAnswer: yes",
