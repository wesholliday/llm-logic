Premise 2: Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n3. Conclusion: The keys are in the drawer.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet. This means that if the keys were in the cabinet, they would be dangling. Since they aren't dangling, it follows that they must be somewhere else.\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the keys: either they are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. Since the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining option is that they are in the drawer.\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\nAnswer: yes",
