Premise 2: Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the sunglasses are in her bag.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head. This means that if they were perched on her head, they would be in a different location than they actually are.\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the sunglasses: either they are perched on her head or they are in her bag. Since we know that they aren't perched on her head, the only remaining option is that they are in her bag.\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\nAnswer: yes",
