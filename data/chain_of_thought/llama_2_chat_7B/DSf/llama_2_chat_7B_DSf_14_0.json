Premise 2: Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the milk is on the counter.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on a logical principle called modus ponens, which states that if A is true and A implies B, then B must be true. In this case, premise 1 (the milk isn't chilling in the fridge) implies that the milk is not in the fridge, and premise 2 (Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter) implies that if the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\nAnswer: yes",
