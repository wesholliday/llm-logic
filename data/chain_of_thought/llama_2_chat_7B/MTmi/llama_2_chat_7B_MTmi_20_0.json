The premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" only holds true if the banana was actually yellow. Since the assumption \"The banana might not have been yellow\" is added to the premise, it means that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow, and therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red.\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, I answer 'Answer: yes' to the question of whether \"The apple was not red\".",
