This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\nHowever, we are also given that Chris might not have finished the face. This could mean that Chris did not finish the race, but it does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race.\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. The argument is inconclusive.\nAnswer: no",
