This means that there are only two possible scenarios: (1) the dreb is vroombed, or (2) the dreb is spened.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we know that the dreb is not spened. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\nStep 4: Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\nAnswer: yes",
