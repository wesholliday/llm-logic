Premise 2: Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the fribble is snurgled.\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether we can infer 'The fribble is snurgled' based on the given premises:\nYes, we can infer 'The fribble is snurgled' because the argument follows a valid logical form. The argument uses modus ponens, which is a valid form of reasoning that involves drawing a conclusion from two premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, so we can accept the argument as valid.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
