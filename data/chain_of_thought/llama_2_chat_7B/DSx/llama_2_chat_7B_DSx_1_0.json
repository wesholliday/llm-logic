Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled: This statement is a logical contradiction, as both options cannot be true at the same time.\n2. The flugel is not zargled: This statement is given, and it implies that the flugel is not in the state of being zargled.\n3. Therefore, the flugel must be blimmed: This conclusion follows logically from the first two statements. If the flugel is not zargled, and either it is blimmed or it is zargled, then it must be blimmed.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
