Premise 2: Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the smonk is vreebled.\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\nPremise 1: The smonk is not plagged. This means that the smonk does not have any plagues.\nPremise 2: Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged. This means that either the smonk has a vreeble or it has a plague.\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if the smonk is not plagged (according to Premise 1), then it must be vreebled (according to Premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically:\nAnswer: yes",
