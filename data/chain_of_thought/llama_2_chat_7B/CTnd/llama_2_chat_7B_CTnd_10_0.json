In this case, the statement \"If advice was offered\" implies that there is a possibility that advice may have been offered. However, the phrase \"was not helpful advice\" negates this possibility by indicating that the advice given was not useful or effective. Therefore, we can conclude that if advice was offered, it was not helpful, which means that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\nStep 4: Formulate the conclusion\nBased on our evaluation, the conclusion we can draw is \"Answer: yes.\" This means that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.",
