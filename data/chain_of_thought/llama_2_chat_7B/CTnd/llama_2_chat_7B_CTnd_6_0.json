In this case, we can infer that if the clothes were washed, then they were not washed.\nMy reasoning for this inference is as follows:\nIf the clothes were washed, it means they underwent the process of washing. However, if they were not washed properly, it means they did not meet the standard or quality expected for proper washing. Therefore, if the clothes were washed, it is impossible for them to have been washed properly, which means they were not washed.\nAnswer: yes",
