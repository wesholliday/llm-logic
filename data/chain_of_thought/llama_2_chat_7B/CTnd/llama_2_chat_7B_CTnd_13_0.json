Premise 2: If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise (assumed)\n3. Inference: If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise (from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument:\nThe argument is based on a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" The conclusion \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises. The correct conclusion would be \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise much.\"\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: no",
