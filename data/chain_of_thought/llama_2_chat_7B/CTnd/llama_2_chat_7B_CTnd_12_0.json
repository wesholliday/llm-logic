Premise 2: If Jane studied long, then she did not study (to be proven)\n3. Inference: If Jane studied, then she did not study long, so if Jane studied long, then she did not study (modus ponens)\n4. Conclusion: Therefore, if Jane studied long, then she did not study.\nNow, let me evaluate the argument and determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\nYes, the argument is valid. The modus ponens rule is a basic logical principle that allows us to draw conclusions from two premises using the words \"if-then.\" In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, so we can accept the argument as valid.\nAnswer: yes",
