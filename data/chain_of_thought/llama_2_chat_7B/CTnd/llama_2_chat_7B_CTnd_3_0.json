Premise 2: If I did not eat a large meal, then I did not eat a meal (assumed)\n3. Conclusion: If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\n1. Premise 1: This premise is given and true.\n2. Premise 2: This premise is assumed to be true, but we are trying to infer its negation.\n3. Conclusion: If we assume that the premise 2 is true, then we can conclude that if I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
