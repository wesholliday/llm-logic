The statement is \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\"\n2. We are asked to infer whether we can conclude \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n3. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n4. The statement \"If the issue was discussed\" implies that the issue was at least briefly mentioned or addressed during a conversation or meeting.\n5. However, the statement \"it was not discussed in depth\" suggests that the issue was not thoroughly explored or examined.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that if the issue was discussed (i.e., it was mentioned), then it was not discussed in depth (i.e., it was not thoroughly explored).\n7. So, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
