If Ann exercised, it means that she did exercise. However, if she exercised strenuously, it means that she did exercise with great intensity or effort. Therefore, we can infer that if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\nSo, based on the given premise and the logical relationship between the two statements, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
