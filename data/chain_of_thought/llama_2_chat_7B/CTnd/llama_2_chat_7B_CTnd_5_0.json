The contrapositive of an argument is obtained by reversing the order of the premises and conclusions. In this case, the contrapositive of the argument would be:\n\"If the room was not cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\"\nNow, let's compare the two arguments:\nThe first argument states that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. The second argument states that if the room was not cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\nSince the two arguments are logically equivalent, we can conclude that:\nAnswer: yes",
