The statement is \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\"\n2. We are asked to infer whether we can conclude \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\"\n3. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n4. The statement \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\" implies that if the issue was addressed, it must have been addressed ineffectively.\n5. On the other hand, the statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" implies that if the issue was addressed effectively, it must not have been addressed at all.\n6. Based on these two statements, we can see that they are logically contradictory. If the issue was addressed and it was not addressed effectively, then it must have been addressed. But if it was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed at all.\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" from the given statement. The two statements are logically incompatible, and we cannot draw a conclusion that goes against the logical relationship between them.\nAnswer: no",
