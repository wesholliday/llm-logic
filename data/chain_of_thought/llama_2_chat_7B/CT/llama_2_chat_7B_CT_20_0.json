In this case, if the apple is red, it means that the banana must be yellow, since they are compared in the premise. Therefore, if the apple is not red, it does not mean that the banana is not yellow.\nStep 4: So, we can conclude that \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\nAnswer: yes",
