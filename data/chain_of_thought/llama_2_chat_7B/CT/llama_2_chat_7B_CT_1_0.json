Premise 2: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding (to be inferred)\n3. Conclusion: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\n1. Premise 1 is a given fact, so we can accept it as true.\n2. To infer Premise 2, we need to use the logical connector \"then.\" If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, which means that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding either.\n3. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so we can answer \"Answer: yes\" to the question.",
