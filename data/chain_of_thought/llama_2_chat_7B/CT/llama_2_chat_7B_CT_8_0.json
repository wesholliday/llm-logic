Conclusion: If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\n1. Premise 1: This premise is given and true.\n2. Premise 2: We are assuming that the vampire is not awake, which means that the mummy must also be not awake (by the transitive property of \"if-then\").\n3.
