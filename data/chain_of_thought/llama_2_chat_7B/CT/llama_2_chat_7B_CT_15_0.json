If Erin took a train, then she did not take a plane (premise 2)\n3. If Sam took a plane, then he did not take a train (premise 3 - logical contradiction)\n4. Therefore, if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane (conclusion)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument:\nPremise 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\nPremise 2: If Erin took a train, then she did not take a plane\nThe argument is based on the idea that if one event (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then another event (Erin taking a train) must also occur. However, this assumption is false, as there may be multiple possible scenarios where both events do not occur. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\nAnswer: no",
