If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park (inference)\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to evaluate the validity of the inference.\nReasoning:\nThe inference is based on the idea that if one event (Joe going to the park) occurs, then another event (Lucy going to the zoo) must also occur. However, this inference is not necessarily true in all cases. For example, Joe might have gone to the park alone, while Lucy went to the zoo with a different person.\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. The inference is invalid because it relies on an unwarranted assumption about the relationship between the two events.\nAnswer: no",
