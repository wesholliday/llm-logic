Premise 2: If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest.\n3. Conclusion: If the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest.\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The griffin is in the forest. This is a given fact, so we can accept it as true.\nPremise 2: If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest. This premise follows logically from the first premise, since the griffin and unicorn are both in the forest. Therefore, this premise is also true.\nConclusion: If the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest. This conclusion follows directly from the two premises, so we can infer it as true.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
