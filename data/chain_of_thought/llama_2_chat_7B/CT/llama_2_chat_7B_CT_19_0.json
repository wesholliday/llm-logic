Therefore, Tom did not watch football (modus ponens)\n4. If Tom did not watch football, then he did not watch any sport (common sense)\nNow, let me evaluate the argument:\nThe argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows directly from the premises and the rules of modus ponens. However, the argument is based on an assumption that Jen did not watch basketball, which may or may not be true. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that Tom did not watch football.\nAnswer: no",
