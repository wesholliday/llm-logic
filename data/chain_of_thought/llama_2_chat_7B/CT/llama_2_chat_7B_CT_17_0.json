Therefore, if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta (conclusion)\nNow, let's evaluate each premise and determine whether we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\nReasoning: This premise states that if Ben consumed pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad. It does not provide any information about Ben's or Kate's preferences or habits, only that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. Therefore, this premise is true.\nPremise 2: If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\nReasoning: This premise states that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben must have not eaten pasta. Again, it does not provide any information about Ben's or Kate's preferences or habits, only that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, this premise is also true.\nNow, let's combine both premises:\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad (premise 1)\nIf Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta (premise 2)\nTherefore, we can infer that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\nAnswer: yes",
