Premise 2: If the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James (deductive conclusion from premise 1)\n3. Conclusion: If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James (deduced from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let's evaluate the argument:\nIs the conclusion logically valid? Yes, it is. The argument follows a valid deductive structure, with each premise leading directly to the conclusion.\nSo, can we infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' from the given premises? Answer: yes.",
