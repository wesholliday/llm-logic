Conclusion: If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\nNow, let's analyze each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nThis means that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim.\nPremise 2: The pants were not denim.\nThis means that the pants are not made of denim.\nNow, let's apply the logical rules of inference to reach the conclusion:\nIf the shirt was cotton (premise 1), then the pants were denim (premise 1).\nBut the pants are not denim (premise 2).\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\nAnswer: yes",
