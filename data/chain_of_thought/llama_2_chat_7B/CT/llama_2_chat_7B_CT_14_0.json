Conclusion: Therefore, the wolf is not in the den.\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear is present in the cave, then the wolf must be present in the den.\n2. The bear is not in the cave. This means that the bear is not present in the cave, and therefore the wolf cannot be present in the den either.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the wolf is not in the den. Since the bear is not in the cave, the wolf cannot be in the den either.\nAnswer: yes",
