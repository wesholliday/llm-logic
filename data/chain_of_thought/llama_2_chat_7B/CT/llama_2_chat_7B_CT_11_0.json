Conclusion: Therefore, the cake was not chocolate.\nNow, let's analyze each premise and see if we can infer the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nThis means that if the cake had the characteristic of being chocolate, then the muffins must have had the characteristic of being blueberry.\nPremise 2: The muffins were not blueberry.\nThis means that the muffins did not have the characteristic of being blueberry.\nNow, let's apply the logical rules of inference to draw a conclusion:\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (Premise 1).\nBut the muffins were not blueberry (Premise 2).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate (Conclusion).\nAnswer: yes",
