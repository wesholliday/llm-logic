Premise 2: If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race (to be inferred)\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\nStep 1: We know that Alex finished the race (premise 1).\nStep 2: We want to infer whether Chris finished the race if Alex did not finish it.\nStep 3: If Chris did not finish the race, then we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race either (using premise 1 and the logical rule of inference \"If A, then B\").\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
