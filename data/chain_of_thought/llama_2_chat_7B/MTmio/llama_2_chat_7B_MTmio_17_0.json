In this case, we can conclude that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad either.\nStep 3: We are given an additional piece of information - \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\nConclusion: Based on the premises and the additional information, we can infer that Kate did not eat salad. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
