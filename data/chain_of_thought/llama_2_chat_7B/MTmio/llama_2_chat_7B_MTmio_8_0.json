The statement only suggests that the mummy might not have been awake, which does not provide any information about the vampire.\nFrom the second premise, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This means that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy cannot be awake either.\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion based on the premises\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy cannot be awake either, as per the second premise. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
