In this case, we cannot infer \"The car was not red.\"\nOn the other hand, if the truck must have been blue if the car was red, then it is impossible for the car to have been red and the truck not to have been blue. In this case, we can infer \"The car was not red.\"\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
