If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (conclusion)\n3. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (inference)\nNow, let me evaluate each step of the argument:\n1. This premise is true. We don't know what Mark has or hasn't bought.\n2. This conclusion follows logically from the premise. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, since they are mutually exclusive.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Yes, that is correct!",
