From the second statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have also been at the wedding.\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion\nBased on the statements provided, we can conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue must have also not been at the wedding. This is because if Mary was not at the wedding, then the second statement does not hold true, and therefore Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain.\nStep 4: Formulate an answer\nAnswer: yes",
