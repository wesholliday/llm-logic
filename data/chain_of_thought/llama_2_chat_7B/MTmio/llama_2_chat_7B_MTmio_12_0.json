Premise 2: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n3. Inference: Therefore, Joe did not go to the park.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nIf Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, then it is possible that she did not go to the zoo. If Joe went to the park, then by the second premise, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the conclusion follows that Joe did not go to the park.\nAnswer: yes",
