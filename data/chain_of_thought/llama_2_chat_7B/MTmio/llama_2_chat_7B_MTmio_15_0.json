This is because if she might not have taken a train, then it's possible that she didn't take one.\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that Sam took a plane. This is because if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\nStep 4: Since we know that Erin did not take a train, and Sam took a plane, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
