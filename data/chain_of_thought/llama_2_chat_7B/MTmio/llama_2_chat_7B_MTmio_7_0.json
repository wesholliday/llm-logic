Premise 2: If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (given)\n3. Inference: Therefore, Alex did not finish the race (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise states that Chris might not have finished the race, which means that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race. The second premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, which means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\nTherefore, based on these two premises, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race. So, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
