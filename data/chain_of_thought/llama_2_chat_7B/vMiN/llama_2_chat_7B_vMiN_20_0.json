It is a true statement, as there is no guarantee that the sunglasses are in the person's bag. Therefore, Premise 1 is valid.\nPremise 2: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\"\nThis premise is based on a negation of the idea that the sunglasses are necessarily in the person's bag. It implies that there is no logical necessity for the sunglasses to be in the bag, which is also true. Therefore, Premise 2 is valid.\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid\nBased on our evaluation of the premises, we can determine if the argument is logically valid. If the argument is logically valid, then the conclusion must follow logically from the premises.\nIn this case, both premises are valid, and the conclusion \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" follows logically from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
