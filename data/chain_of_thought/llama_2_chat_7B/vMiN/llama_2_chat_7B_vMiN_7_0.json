It's possible that Alex may have finished the race but chose not to reveal it, or that he encountered an obstacle during the race and was unable to complete it. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce from the first premise that Alex must have not finished the race.\nThe second premise \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" is a tautology, which means it is true by definition but does not provide any new information or insight. This premise does not help us determine whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion cannot be deduced with absolute certainty from the premises using logical reasoning.",
