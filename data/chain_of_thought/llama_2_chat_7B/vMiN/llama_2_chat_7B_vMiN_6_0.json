Modus ponens is a valid form of reasoning if the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them. In this case, the premises are \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" and \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" Using modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from these premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
