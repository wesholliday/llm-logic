Therefore, the premise is neither true nor false.\nStep 3: Evaluate the logical validity of the argument.\nAn argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" does not necessarily follow from the premise \"The toy might not be in the toy box\". The argument is not logically valid.\nAnswer: no",
