However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the griffin must have been somewhere else in the forest. It could be anywhere, or maybe it's not even in the forest at all. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" is not logically deduced from the premise.\nAnswer: no",
