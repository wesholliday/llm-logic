Conclusion: It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\nTo reach this conclusion, we are using the logical rule of inference known as modus tollens. Here's how it works:\nIf P (the pen might not be in my bag) \u2192 \u00acQ (it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag),\nwhere P is the premise and Q is the conclusion.\nSo, if the premise \"The pen might not be in my bag\" is true, then we can logically deduce the conclusion \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\". Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
