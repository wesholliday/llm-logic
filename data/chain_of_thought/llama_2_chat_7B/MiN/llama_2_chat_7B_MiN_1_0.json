            "content": "Okay, let me break down the argument step by step:\n1. Premise 1: Mary might not have been at the wedding.\nThis premise is a possibility, as we don't know for sure whether Mary was present at the wedding or not. It's possible that she had other commitments or simply didn't feel like attending.\n2. Premise 2: If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\nThis premise follows logically from the first premise. If there is a possibility that Mary wasn't at the wedding, then it's not true that she must have been there.\n3. Conclusion: It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\nBased on the two premises, we can conclude that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
