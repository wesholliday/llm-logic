Premise 2: It's possible for something to exist and not be in a particular place (e.g., a book could be on a shelf in another room).\n3. Conclusion: It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: Premise 1 states that the notebook might not be in the drawer, and Premise 2 states that it's possible for something to exist and not be in a particular place. From these two premises, we can conclude that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
