Conclusion: Therefore, it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each step:\n1. Premise 1: This premise is based on the fact that we don't know what Sue actually chose to eat. We can infer that she might have chosen something else instead of pizza.\n2. Premise 2: This premise is a logical consequence of the fact that if Sue had chosen pizza, then she would have eaten it. If she didn't eat it, then she must not have chosen it.\n3. Conclusion: Based on the above two premises, we can conclude that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
