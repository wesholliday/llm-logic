    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the given information\nThe given information can be summarized as follows:\n* The flinker, dringen, and n\u00fcffen are the top prospects for having a breakout season next year.\n* Talent scouts believe it's highly probable that the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen.\n* The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible scenarios\n\nBased on the given information, there are three possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Flinker has a breakout season\n\n* The flinker has a breakout season, and hence the dringen does not have a breakout season.\n* Since the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot, it is unlikely to have a breakout season in this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: Dringen has a breakout season\n\n* The dringen has a breakout season, and hence the flinker does not have a breakout season.\n* Since the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot, it is unlikely to have a breakout season in this scenario.\n\nScenario 3: N\u00fcffen has a breakout season\n\n* The n\u00fcffen has a breakout season, and hence neither the flinker nor the dringen has a breakout season.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion based on the given information\n\nBased on the given information, it can be concluded that if the flinker does not have a breakout season, then it is likely that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. This is because the dringen is unlikely to have a breakout season in either scenario 1 or scenario 2, and hence the n\u00fcffen is the only remaining option for having a breakout season if the flinker does not.\nAnswer: Yes",
