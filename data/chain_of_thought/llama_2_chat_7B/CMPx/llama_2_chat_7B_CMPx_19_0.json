    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the situation\nThe given scenario involves three candidates - a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk - competing for the position of \"domer of the year.\" Experts believe that the garplex is the most likely to win, followed by the beelhet, with the peedonk having the lowest chance. If the beelhet doesn't become domer, and the garplex doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer.\nStep 2: Identify the possible outcomes\nThere are three possible outcomes in this scenario:\n1. Garplex becomes domer\n2. Beelhet becomes domer\n3. Peedonk becomes domer\n\nStep 3: Analyze the probability of each outcome\n\nProbability of Garplex becoming domer: 0.5 (since experts think it's most likely to win)\nProbability of Beelhet becoming domer: 0.4 (since it's the second most likely candidate)\nProbability of Peedonk becoming domer: 0.1 (since it has the lowest chance)\n\nStep 4: Determine the conditional probability of each outcome given the previous outcome\n\nGiven that the garplex doesn't become domer, the probability of the peedonk becoming domer is:\nProbability = (0.1) x (0.8) = 0.08\n\nGiven that the beelhet doesn't become domer, the probability of the peedonk becoming domer is:\nProbability = (0.1) x (0.9) = 0.09\n\nAnswer: Yes",
