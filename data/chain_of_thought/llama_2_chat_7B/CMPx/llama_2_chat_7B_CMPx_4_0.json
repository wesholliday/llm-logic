    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the situation\nThe given statement describes a scenario where three candidates - Crinel, Nafiz, and Tomul - are competing for the position of Snarggle on the next year's Laggle team. The Crinel is considered the frontrunner, followed by the Nafiz, while the Tomul is a long shot. If the Nafiz isn't named Snarggle, and the Crinel isn't named Snarggle, then the Tomul will be named Snarggle.\nStep 2: Identify the possible outcomes\n\nThere are three possible outcomes in this scenario:\n\n1. The Crinel is named Snarggle - In this case, the Nafiz won't be named Snarggle, and the Tomul will be named Snarggle.\n2. The Nafiz is named Snarggle - In this case, the Crinel won't be named Snarggle, and neither will the Tomul.\n3. The Tomul is named Snarggle - In this case, neither the Crinel nor the Nafiz will be named Snarggle.\n\nStep 3: Determine the probability of each outcome\n\nProbability of outcome 1: The Crinel is named Snarggle\n\nThe probability of the Crinel being named Snarggle is 50%, as there are only two candidates competing for the position.\n\nProbability of outcome 2: The Nafiz is named Snarggle\n\nThe probability of the Nafiz being named Snarggle is also 50%, as there is no information to suggest that they have a lower chance of being selected.\n\nProbability of outcome 3: The Tomul is named Snarggle\n\nThe probability of the Tomul being named Snarggle is 25%, as they are considered a long shot compared to the other two candidates.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of the Tomul being named Snarggle if the Crinel isn't named Snarggle\n\nTo calculate the probability of the Tomul being named Snarggle if the Crinel isn't named Snarggle, we need to multiply the probability of the Crinel not being named Snarggle (50%) with the probability of the Tomul being named Snarggle in that scenario (25%). Therefore, the probability of the Tomul being named Snarggle if the Crinel isn't named Snarggle is 12.5%.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
