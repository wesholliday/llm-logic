    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the given information\nThe given information can be summarized as follows:\n* The fantug is considered the front runner for Blither of the Year.\n* If the loperit doesn't win, and the fantug doesn't win, then the frallon will win.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible outcomes\n\nBased on the given information, there are three possible outcomes:\n\n1. Fantug wins Blither of the Year.\n2. Loperit wins Blither of the Year.\n3. Frallon wins Blither of the Year.\n\nStep 3: Determine the probability of each outcome\n\nProbability of Fantug winning: 0.7 (based on it being the front runner)\nProbability of Loperit winning: 0.2 (based on it being a heavy underdog)\nProbability of Frallon winning: 0.1 (based on it being an underdog)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of Frallon winning if Fantug doesn't win\n\nIf Fantug doesn't win, then the only remaining option is Loperit or Frallon. Since Loperit is also a heavy underdog, the probability of it winning is negligible (0.2). Therefore, the probability of Frallon winning if Fantug doesn't win is:\nProbability of Frallon winning if Fantug doesn't win = Probability of Frallon winning / (Probability of Fantug winning + Probability of Loperit winning)\n= 0.1 / (0.7 + 0.2)\n= 0.143 (or approximately 14.3%)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
