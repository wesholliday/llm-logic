    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the given information\nThe trendel is considered the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum. The doffen is a long shot to win. If the laxum doesn't win Best Ploggel, and the trendel doesn't win, then the doffen will win.\nStep 2: Analyze the argument\nThe argument states that if the laxum doesn't win Best Ploggel, and the trendel doesn't win, then the doffen will win. We need to determine whether this conclusion follows logically from the given information.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) if the laxum doesn't win Best Ploggel, and (2) if the trendel doesn't win, then the doffen will win. The first premise implies that the laxum is not the winner of Best Ploggel. The second premise implies that the trendel is not the winner of Best Ploggel. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nAnswer: Yes",
