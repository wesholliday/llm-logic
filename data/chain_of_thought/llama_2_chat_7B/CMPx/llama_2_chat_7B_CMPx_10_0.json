    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: Understand the given information\nThe information provided is as follows:\n* The fantole, dribban, and cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month.\n* Market watchers expect the fantole to retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower.\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion being drawn\nThe conclusion being drawn is that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be.\nStep 3: Break down the argument step by step\n\n* Premise 1: The fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower.\n* Premise 2: If the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the dribban won't be.\n* Conclusion: Therefore, it's likely that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument\nThe argument is based on two premises. Premise 1 provides evidence that the fantole is likely to be the most downloaded app, while Premise 2 provides evidence that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the dribban won't be. The conclusion follows logically from these premises.\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is strong or weak\nThe argument is strong because it is based on two premises that are supported by evidence. Premise 1 is based on the expectations of market watchers, while Premise 2 is based on the fact that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the dribban won't be.\nAnswer: Yes",
