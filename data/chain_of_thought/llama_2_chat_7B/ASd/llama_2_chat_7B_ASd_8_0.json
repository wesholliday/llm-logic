If the package has shipped, then it must have left the sender's location and is in transit.\n2. If the package was misrouted, then it means that it was sent to a wrong address or location.\n3. Since the package has already left the sender's location and is in transit, it cannot be delivered to a wrong address or location.\n4. Therefore, if the package has been misrouted, it will still arrive at its intended destination today.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
