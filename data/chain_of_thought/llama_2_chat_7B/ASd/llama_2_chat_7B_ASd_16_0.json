In this case, it does. The premise states that fertilizing the lawn will make it lush and green, and the conclusion extends this statement to include the possibility of a drought. Therefore, the argument is valid.\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nBased on the evaluation in step 3, we can conclude that the argument is valid and the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
