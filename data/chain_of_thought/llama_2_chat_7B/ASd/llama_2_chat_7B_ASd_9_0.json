In this case, the conclusion is \"the student will get an A.\"\nStep 2: Identify the premises of the argument. The premises are the reasons or evidence that support the conclusion. In this case, the premise is \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\"\nStep 3: Determine whether the premises logically lead to the conclusion. In other words, can we infer the conclusion from the premises?\nIn this case, the premise \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" is a direct cause-and-effect relationship.
