In this case, the inference is based on the idea that if getting enough sleep helps avoid fatigue, then doing hard labor (which is physically demanding) will also help avoid fatigue.\nStep 4: Make a decision\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that the inference \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" is valid. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
