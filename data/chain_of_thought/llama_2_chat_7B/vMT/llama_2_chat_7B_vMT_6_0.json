This means that if Sue made a particular choice (pizza), then Bob must have made the opposite choice (pasta).\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise of the argument\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Bob did not choose pasta\". This means that Bob did not make the opposite choice to what Sue chose.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nBased on the premises, the conclusion of the argument is \"Sue did not choose pizza\". This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, but since Bob did not choose pasta, Sue must not have chosen pizza.\nAnswer: yes",
