This means that if Tom engaged in one activity (watching football), then Jen must have engaged in another activity (basketball).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe are asked to determine whether the argument is logically valid. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth value of each premise.\nPremise 1: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" - This premise is true. If Tom watched football, then it is reasonable to assume that Jen watched basketball, as they are related activities.\nPremise 2: \"Jen did not watch basketball\" - This premise is also true. We are given that Jen did not watch basketball, which means that the second part of the argument (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball) does not hold.\nStep 3: Conclude whether the argument is logically valid\nBased on our evaluation in step 2, we can conclude that the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" cannot be drawn from the premises given.\nAnswer: no",
