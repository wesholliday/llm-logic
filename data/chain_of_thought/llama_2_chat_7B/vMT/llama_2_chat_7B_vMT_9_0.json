            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This means that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, it must be true that Mark purchased the blue shirt.\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise of the argument\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". This means that Mark did not purchase the blue shirt, which is one of the options mentioned in the first premise.\nStep 3: Conclude whether the argument is logically valid or not\nBased on the two premises provided, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" follows directly from the premises, which means that if the first premise is true (i.e., Lisa bought the red shirt), then the conclusion must be true as well.\nAnswer: yes",
