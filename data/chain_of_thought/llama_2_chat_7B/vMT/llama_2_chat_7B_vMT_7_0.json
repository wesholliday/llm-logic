This means that if Alex completed the race, then it must be true that Chris also completed the race.\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise of the argument\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Chris did not finish the race\". This means that Chris did not complete the race, which in turn implies that Alex did not complete the race either, since the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nBased on the two premises, the conclusion of the argument is \"Alex did not finish the race\".\nAnswer: yes",
