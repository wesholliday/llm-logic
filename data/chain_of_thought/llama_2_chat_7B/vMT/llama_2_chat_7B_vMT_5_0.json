            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This means that if Jeff engaged in one activity (basketball), then Amy must have engaged in another activity (tennis).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe are asked to determine whether the argument is logically valid. To do this, we need to evaluate the truth value of each premise.\nPremise 1: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" - This premise is true. If Jeff played basketball, then by logical implication, Amy must have played tennis.\nPremise 2: \"Amy did not play tennis\" - This premise is also true. We are given that Amy did not play tennis, which means that the second part of the argument's condition is satisfied.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Jeff did not play basketball\". This follows logically from the premises, as if Jeff played basketball (which he did not), then Amy played tennis (which she did not). Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball.\nAnswer: yes",
