Let's evaluate the truth value of this premise. If the muffins were actually blueberry, then the argument would be valid. However, since we are given that the muffins were not blueberry, we can conclude that the second premise is false. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The cake was not chocolate\". Since the argument is logically invalid, the conclusion must also be false.\nAnswer: yes",
