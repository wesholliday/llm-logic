            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\". This means that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest.\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise of the argument\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The unicorn was not in the forest\". This means that the unicorn is not present in the forest.\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion of the argument\nBased on the premises, the conclusion of the argument is \"The griffin was not in the forest\". This means that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn must also not be in the forest.\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" does follow necessarily from the premises \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The unicorn was not in the forest\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
