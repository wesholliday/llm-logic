Let's evaluate the truth value of this premise. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the conclusion that the alien did not visit Mars follows logically. Therefore, the second premise is true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nSince both premises are true, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
