To do this, we ask ourselves whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we want to know whether the conclusion is a necessary result of the premises.\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" logically follows from the premises \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were not denim\". Therefore, the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
