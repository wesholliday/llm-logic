            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". This means that if the dog is inside some location, then the cat must be outside that location.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the second premise \"The cat was not outside\" separately.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nIf both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, since the first premise states that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside, and the second premise states that the cat is not outside, it means that if the dog is inside, then it cannot be outside, which leads to the conclusion that the dog was not inside.\nStep 4: Confirm the validity of the argument\nBased on our evaluation, we can confirm that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
