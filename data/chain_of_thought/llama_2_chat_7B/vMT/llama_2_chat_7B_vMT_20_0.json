            "content": "Step 1: Identify the type of argument\nThe argument provided is a categorical syllogism, which is a type of deductive argument that follows the form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: Therefore A\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premises\nLet's evaluate each premise of the argument:\nPremise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nThis premise is true by definition. Red apples and yellow bananas are mutually exclusive properties, so if an apple is red, it cannot be a banana.\nPremise 2: The banana was not yellow.\nThis premise is also true by definition. We know that the banana is not yellow because it has a different color property than the apple.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow, let's determine whether the argument is logically valid or invalid. To do this, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" logically follows from the premises \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was not yellow\". Therefore, the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
