(Assuming this is true)\nPremise 2: Erin did not take a train. (Given)\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, since the second premise states that Erin did not take a train, and the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\nAnswer: yes",
