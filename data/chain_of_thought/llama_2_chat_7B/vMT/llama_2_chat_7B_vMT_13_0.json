This means that if the car had a certain property (i.e., being red), then the truck must have another property (i.e., being blue).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The truck was not blue\". This means that the truck does not have the property of being blue, which is the opposite of what the first premise states.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nBased on the truth or falsity of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. If both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, since the second premise is false (the truck was not blue), the argument is invalid. Therefore,\nAnswer: no",
