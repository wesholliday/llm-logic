This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then it is true that Sue attended the wedding as well.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"Sue was not at the wedding\". We must determine whether this premise is true or false.\nAnswer: Yes, the second premise is true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nUsing the truth of the premises, we can now evaluate the validity of the argument. If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, then the argument is valid.\nAnswer: No, the argument is not valid. The conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" does not logically follow from the premises.\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid.",
