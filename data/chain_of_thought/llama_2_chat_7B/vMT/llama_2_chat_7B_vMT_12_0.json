            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if Joe visited the park, it must be true that Lucy visited the zoo.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nWe are asked to evaluate the truth of each premise separately. Let's consider the second premise \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This is a statement of fact, and we can verify its truth or falsity by checking our observations or evidence. If Lucy did not actually visit the zoo, then the second premise is true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, the conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" follows directly from the premises \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
