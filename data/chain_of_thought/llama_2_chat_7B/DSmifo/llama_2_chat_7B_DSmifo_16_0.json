Premise 1: The pen might not be on my desk.\nThis premise is a possibility, as I may have left the pen somewhere else in the room or outside of the room altogether.\n2. Premise 2: Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\nThis premise is true by definition of the terms \"on my desk\" and \"in my bag\". If the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n3. Conclusion: The pen is in my bag.\nFrom the two premises above, we can conclude that the pen must be in my bag because it cannot be on my desk if it is not there.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
