Premise 1: The book might not be resting on the table.\nThis premise implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. It could be somewhere else in the room or even outside of the room.\n2. Premise 2: Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\nThis premise states that there are only two possible locations for the book: either it is resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This means that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n3. Conclusion: The book is on the shelf.\nBased on the two premises provided, we can conclude that the book is most likely to be on the shelf. This is because if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf by default.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
