Premise 2: It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the pen is in my bag.\nNow, let me explain why I think this inference is valid:\nThe argument is based on two premises, which are both true by definition of the terms. The first premise simply states that there are only two possible locations for the pen: either it's in the bag or it's on the desk. The second premise negates the possibility that the pen must be on the desk, which means that if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\nSo, based on these two premises, we can logically conclude that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
