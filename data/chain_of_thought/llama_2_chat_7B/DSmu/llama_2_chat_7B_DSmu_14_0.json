Premise 2: It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the milk is on the counter.\nNow, let me explain why I think this inference is valid:\nThe argument is structured as a disjunctive syllogism, where we are given two alternatives (the milk is either on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge) and then told that one of these alternatives is false (it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge). Since we know that the second premise is true, and the first premise presents two mutually exclusive possibilities, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
