Premise 2: It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the remote control is on the coffee table.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise states that the remote control can be in one of two places: either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. The second premise negates the possibility that it must be hiding under the couch. Since the second premise eliminates one possible location for the remote control, the only remaining option is that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically and we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\nAnswer: yes",
