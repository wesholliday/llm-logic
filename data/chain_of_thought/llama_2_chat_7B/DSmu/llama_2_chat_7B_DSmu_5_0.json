Premise 2: It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n3. Inference: From the two premises, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\nMy reasoning is as follows:\nIf the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (which is the case according to Premise 2), then they must be in the jar (according to Premise 1). Therefore, the conclusion that the cookies are in the jar follows logically from the two premises.\nAnswer: yes",
