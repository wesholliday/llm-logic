Premise 2: It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n3. Inference: Therefore, the cat is napping on the couch.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises. The first premise tells us that the cat can be either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. The second premise tells us that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. From these two premises, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
