From \"The splat is not quanked,\" we know that the splat is not in a state of being quanked.\n2. From \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed,\" we know that either the splat is in a state of being quanked, or it is in a state of being morphed.\n3. Since the splat is not quanked (according to premise 1), the only option left is that it is morphed.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\nAnswer: yes",
