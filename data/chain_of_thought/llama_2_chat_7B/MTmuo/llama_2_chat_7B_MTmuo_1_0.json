            "content": "Okay, let me break down the argument and explain my reasoning:\nStep 1: We are given two premises - \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\nStep 2: From the first premise, we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding. This is because if Sue must have been at the wedding (according to the second premise), then she would have been at the wedding, but since it's not the case that she must have been at the wedding, she cannot have been there.\nStep 3: Now, we can use the second premise again to infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is because if Mary was at the wedding, then according to the second premise, Sue must have been at the wedding as well.\nStep 4: However, we have already established in step 2 that Sue was not at the wedding. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding either, since if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well.\nAnswer: yes",
