In this case, we can deduce that either Joe did not go to the park or Lucy did not go to the zoo.\nStep 3: Since we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, and we are given that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
