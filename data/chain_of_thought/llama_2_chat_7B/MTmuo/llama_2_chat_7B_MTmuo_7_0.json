This is because if Chris must have finished the race, then he would have finished it, but since it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race, he did not finish it.\nStep 3: Now, we use the second premise to deduce a conclusion. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (by transitivity of \"must\" - if A must B, and B is true, then A is true). But since we just inferred that Chris did not finish the race, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race either.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
