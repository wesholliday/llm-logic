Let's do this by using the logical operator \"must\" in both premises.\nPremise 1: It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\nPremise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nStep 3: We can now use the logical operator \"not\" to negate the conclusion of Premise 2, which gives us:\nConclusion: The bear was not in the cave.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
