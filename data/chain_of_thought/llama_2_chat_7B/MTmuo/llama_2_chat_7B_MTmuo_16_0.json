It does not provide any information about the material of the shirt.\nStep 2: We are also given \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\nThis statement tells us that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim.\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\nStep 3: We can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim by the second statement.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
