This statement provides additional information about the possible locations of the pen.\nStep 3: Infer the location of the pen\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the pen is either in the speaker's bag or on their desk. Since it is not the case that the pen must be on the speaker's desk, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the speaker's bag.\nAnswer: yes",
