Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement is a logical contradiction, as it implies that there are only two possible locations for Fido (inside and garden), but then immediately rules out one of those locations (the garden).\n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement is true, as we cannot infer that Fido must be in the garden based on the given information.\n3. Can we infer that Fido is inside?\nNo, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the given information, as there is no evidence to suggest that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
