This means that the only possible locations for the missing sock are the laundry basket and under the bed.\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nSince it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed, we can infer that it is likely to be in the laundry basket. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
