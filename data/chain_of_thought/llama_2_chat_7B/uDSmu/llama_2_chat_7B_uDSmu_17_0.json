This statement provides additional information about the possible locations of the scarf.\nStep 3: Infer the location of the scarf\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack. Since it is not necessary for the scarf to be on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that it is stuffed in the backpack.\nAnswer: yes",
