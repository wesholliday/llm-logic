This statement eliminates one possible location for the milk, which is the fridge.\nStep 3: Infer the location of the milk\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the milk is most likely on the counter. This is because there are only two possible locations for the milk, and the second statement eliminates one of those locations (the fridge). Therefore, the probability of the milk being on the counter is higher than the probability of it being in the fridge.\nAnswer: yes",
