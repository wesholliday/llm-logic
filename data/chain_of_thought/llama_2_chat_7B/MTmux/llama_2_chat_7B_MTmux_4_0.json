If something is snurgled, it necessarily has crinkles. Therefore, this premise is valid.\nStep 2: The conclusion \"The fribble was not snurgled\" is being inferred from the premise. However, we are given additional information in the form of the premise \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\". This means that the fribble did not necessarily have crinkles, even if it was snurgled. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically follows from the premises, and the argument is not sound.\nAnswer: no",
