Conclusion: Therefore, the pen is in my bag.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the pen isn't on my desk.\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the pen: either it is in my bag or it is on my desk.\nSince we know that the pen isn't on my desk, the only remaining possibility is that it is in my bag. Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\nAnswer: yes",
