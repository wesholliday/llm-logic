Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack (conclusion)\n3. The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack (premise)\n4. Therefore, the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack (conclusion)\nMy reasoning is as follows:\nIf the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be either stuffed in my backpack or draped somewhere else. Since we know that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack, the only possible location left is my backpack. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically: the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\nAnswer: yes",
