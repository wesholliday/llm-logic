Premise 2: Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the book is on the shelf.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) The book isn't resting on the table, and (2) Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. From these premises, we can deduce that if the book isn't resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf. This is because there are only two options for where the book could be: either on the shelf or resting on the table. Since the book isn't resting on the table, the only remaining option is that it is on the shelf.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
