Premise 2: Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n3. Conclusion: The notebook is in the drawer.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand. From premise 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the notebook: either it is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand. Since the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, the only remaining option is that it is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\nAnswer: yes",
