If the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. - This is the conclusion that we want to draw from the premise.\nNow, let me think about this argument and evaluate its validity:\nStep 1: The watch isn't on his wrist. (Premise)\nStep 2: If the watch isn't on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. (Conclusion)\nMy reasoning is as follows:\nIf the watch isn't on his wrist, then it must be somewhere else. Since we know that the watch isn't on his wrist, the only other possible location for the watch is the dresser. Therefore, the conclusion that we want to draw from the premise is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
