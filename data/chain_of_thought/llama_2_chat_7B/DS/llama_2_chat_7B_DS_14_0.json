Premise 2: Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the milk is on the counter.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This means that if the milk is anywhere, it must be on the counter or somewhere else outside of the fridge.\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the milk: the counter or the fridge. Since the milk isn't in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\nAnswer: yes",
