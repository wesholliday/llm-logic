Conclusion: Therefore, Fido is inside.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on a logical principle called modus ponens, which states that if A implies B and B is true, then A must be true. In this case, premise 1 states that Fido is not in the garden, and premise 2 states that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. Since we know that Fido is not in the garden, we can conclude that Fido must be inside using modus ponens.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
