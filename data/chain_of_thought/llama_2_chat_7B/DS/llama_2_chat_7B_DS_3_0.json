Premise 2: Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the keys are in the drawer.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nFrom premise 1, we know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet. This means that if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, they must be in the drawer.\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the keys: the drawer or the cabinet. Since we have already ruled out the possibility that the keys are dangling in the cabinet (premise 1), this means that the keys must be in the drawer.\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\nAnswer: yes",
