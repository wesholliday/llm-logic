            "content": "Okay, let's break this down step by step:\nStep 1: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\nReasoning: This statement is a logical consequence of the fact that apples and bananas are different fruits with distinct colors. Red is the typical color of apples, while yellow is the typical color of bananas. Therefore, if an apple is red, it means that it is an apple, and as apples are known to be red, the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" follows logically.\nStep 2: Now, we are asked to infer whether if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\nReasoning: Based on the previous step, if the banana was yellow, it means that it is a banana, and as bananas are known to be yellow, we can conclude that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\nAnswer: Yes",
