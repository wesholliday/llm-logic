In other words, we need to decide whether the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" can be inferred from the original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\nBased on the information provided, it is logical to conclude that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
