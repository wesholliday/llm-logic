Therefore, we can infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on the principle of transitivity, which states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, premise 1 implies premise 2, and premise 2 implies the conclusion. Therefore, we can infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\nAnswer: yes",
