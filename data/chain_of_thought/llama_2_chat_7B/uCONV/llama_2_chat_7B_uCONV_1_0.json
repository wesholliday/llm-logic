In this case, we have two premises: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1), and If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding (premise 2). By applying the principle of transitivity, we can conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
