            "content": "Okay, let me break down the argument step by step:\nStep 1: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is given.\nStep 2: We are asked to infer whether we can conclude that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\nStep 3: To determine this, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\nStep 4: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the doll's material and the truck's material. If the doll is made of plastic, it means that the truck must be made of something else (metal).\nStep 5: Now, we are asked to apply this logical relationship to the opposite scenario: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\nStep 6: Using the same logic as before, we can see that if the truck is made of metal, it means that the doll must be made of something else (plastic).\nStep 7: Therefore, we can conclude that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\nAnswer: yes",
