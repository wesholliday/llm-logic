Conclusion: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\nNow, let me evaluate the validity of this argument:\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.\nExplanation: The argument follows a valid form of reasoning, known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a type of logical rule that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, where one of the premises is a conditional statement. In this case, the argument starts with two premises, both of which are true, and then logically deduces the conclusion based on those premises. Therefore, the argument is valid.",
