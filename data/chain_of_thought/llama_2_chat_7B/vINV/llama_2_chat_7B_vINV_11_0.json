This is because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\nPremise 1 states that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. However, Premise 2 states that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are not blueberry. These two premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\nTherefore, the argument is NOT logically valid.\nAnswer: no",
