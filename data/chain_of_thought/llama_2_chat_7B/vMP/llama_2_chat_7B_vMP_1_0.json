            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then it is necessarily true that Sue attended the wedding as well.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the truth of each premise separately:\nPremise 1: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\nTruth value: True\nThis premise is logically valid, as it simply states a logical consequence of the fact that Mary attended the wedding. If Mary did attend the wedding, then it follows necessarily that Sue also attended the wedding.\nPremise 2: \"Mary was at the wedding\"\nTruth value: True\nThis premise is also true, as we are assuming that Mary did indeed attend the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nNow that we have evaluated the truth of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" follows necessarily from them. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
