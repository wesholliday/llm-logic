This means that if the dog is inside some location, then the cat must be outside that location.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the second premise \"The dog was inside\" and see if it is true or false.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nIf both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So, we need to determine whether the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
