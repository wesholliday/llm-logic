This means that if Sue made a particular choice (pizza), then Bob must have made the opposite choice (pasta).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's assume that Sue and Bob are individuals who actually exist and have made choices related to food.\nPremise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\nTruth value: True (assuming Sue actually chose pizza)\nPremise 2: Sue chose pizza\nTruth value: True (assuming Sue actually chose pizza)\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\nIn this case, the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" follows necessarily from the premises \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Sue chose pizza\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
