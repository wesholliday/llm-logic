            "content": "Step 1: Identify the type of argument\nThe argument provided is a categorical syllogism, which is a type of deductive argument that follows the form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B\nPremise 2: A\nConclusion: Therefore B\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument\nTo determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In this case, let's analyze each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\nThis premise is true based on our assumption that the shirt and pants are related in some way (e.g., they belong to the same person).\nPremise 2: The shirt was cotton\nThis premise is true, as we have been given that the shirt was indeed made of cotton.\nConclusion: Therefore the pants were denim\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (according to the first premise). Since we know that the shirt was cotton (according to the second premise), we can conclude that the pants were denim (according to the conclusion). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
