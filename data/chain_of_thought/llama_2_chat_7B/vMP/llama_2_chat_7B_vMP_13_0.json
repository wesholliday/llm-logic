            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car had a certain property (i.e., being red), then the truck must have another property (i.e., being blue).\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of each premise\nThe second premise of the argument is \"The car was red.\" To determine whether this premise is true or false, we need to consider evidence or reasons that support or refute it. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the car was indeed red.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the conclusion\nBased on the two premises, the conclusion of the argument is \"The truck was blue.\" To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, we need to ask ourselves if the conclusion is true only if the premises are true.\nAnswer: Yes",
