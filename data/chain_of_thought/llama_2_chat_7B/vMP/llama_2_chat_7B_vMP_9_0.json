Let's assume that Lisa actually did buy a red shirt in this scenario.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the conclusion based on the premises\nUsing the first premise and the second premise, we can conclude that \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
