Let's evaluate the truth of each premise separately:\nPremise 1: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\nTruth value: True\nWe can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo because there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.\nPremise 2: \"Joe went to the park\"\nTruth value: True\nAssuming this premise is true, we can conclude that Joe did indeed go to the park.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth of each premise, let's determine whether the argument is logically valid. A logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\nIn this case, the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" follows directly from the premises \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Joe went to the park.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
