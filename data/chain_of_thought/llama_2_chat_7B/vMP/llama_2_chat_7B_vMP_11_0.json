In this case, let's analyze each premise and see if they are true or false:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\nThis premise is true.\nPremise 2: The cake was chocolate\nThis premise is also true.\nConclusion: Therefore the muffins were blueberry\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nBased on our evaluation in step 2, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
