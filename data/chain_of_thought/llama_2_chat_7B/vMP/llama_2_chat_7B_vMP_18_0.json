In this case, let's analyze each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nThis premise is true based on our understanding of the properties of plastic and metal.\nPremise 2: The doll was plastic.\nThis premise is also true, as we know that the doll was made of plastic.\nConclusion: Therefore the truck was metal.\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Just because the doll was plastic, it does not mean that the truck was metal. The two objects have different properties and cannot be directly inferred to have a causal relationship. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\nAnswer: no",
