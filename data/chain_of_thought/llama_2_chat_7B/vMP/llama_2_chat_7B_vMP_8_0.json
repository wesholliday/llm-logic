            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of each premise\nWe need to determine whether each premise is true or false. Let's evaluate the truth value of each premise separately:\nPremise 1: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\nTruth Value: True\nThis premise is logically valid, as it simply states a causal relationship between two events (the vampire being awake and the mummy being awake).\nPremise 2: \"The vampire was awake\"\nTruth Value: True\nThis premise is also true, as we have assumed that the vampire is awake for the purpose of this argument.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth value of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\nIn this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
