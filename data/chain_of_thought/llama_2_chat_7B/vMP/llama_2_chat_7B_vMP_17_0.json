It is a type of argument that uses premises to reach a conclusion based on the laws of logic.\nStep 2: Evaluate the premises\nLet's evaluate the first premise: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\"\nThis premise is true by definition. If Ben ate pasta, then it is logical to conclude that Kate ate salad, as these are two separate actions that do not necessarily have a causal relationship.\nNow let's evaluate the second premise: \"Ben ate pasta.\"\nThis premise is also true. If Ben ate pasta, then we can conclude that the first premise is true.\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Kate ate salad.\"\nBased on the premises provided, it is logical to conclude that Kate ate salad. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
