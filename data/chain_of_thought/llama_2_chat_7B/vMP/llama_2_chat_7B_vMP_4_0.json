This means that if the alien visited the planet Mars, then the robot must have visited the planet Jupiter.\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of each premise\nWe need to evaluate whether each premise is true or false.\nPremise 1: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" - This premise is true.\nPremise 2: \"The alien visited Mars\" - This premise is also true.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth value of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises.\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The robot visited Jupiter\" follows necessarily from the premises \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The alien visited Mars\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
