Sue did not choose pizza (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and whether we can infer anything about Bob's choice based on Sue's choice.\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue made one choice, Bob must have made the opposite choice (pasta).\nSue did not choose pizza. This means that Sue did not make the choice that would lead to Bob making the choice \"pasta\".\nBased on these premises, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta. The reasoning is as follows: if Sue didn't choose pizza, then Bob must have chosen the opposite option (pasta), but since Sue didn't choose pizza, Bob didn't choose pasta either.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
