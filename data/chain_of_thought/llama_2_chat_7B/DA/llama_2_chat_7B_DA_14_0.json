Premise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (given)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the wolf was not in the den (inference)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: The bear was not in the cave. This is a given fact, so it does not affect the inference.\nPremise 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is a logical implication, as the wolf is assumed to be in the den if the bear is in the cave.\nConclusion: Therefore, the wolf was not in the den. This is the inference drawn from the premises, which means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den either.\nAnswer: yes",
