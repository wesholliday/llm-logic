Sam did not take a plane (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and whether we can infer anything about Erin's action based on them:\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam's mode of transportation is different from the one Erin took, then Erin must have taken a train.\nSam did not take a plane. This means that Sam's mode of transportation is the same as Erin's, which we know to be a train.\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can infer that Erin took a train.\nAnswer: yes",
