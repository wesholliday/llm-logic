Ben did not eat pasta (premise 2)\nNow, let me think about how these premises relate to each other and whether we can infer anything about Kate's behavior based on them.\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. This means that if Ben had eaten pasta, Kate would have eaten the salad as well.\nBen did not eat pasta. This means that Ben did not fulfill the condition of the first premise, which means that Kate did not eat the salad either.\nTherefore, based on these two premises, we can infer that Kate did not eat the salad.\nAnswer: yes",
