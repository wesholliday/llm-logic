Conclusion: Therefore, Sue was not at the wedding.\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on two premises: Premise 1 states that Mary was not at the wedding, and Premise 2 states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. By using modus ponens (a form of logical reasoning), we can infer that since Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding either. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
