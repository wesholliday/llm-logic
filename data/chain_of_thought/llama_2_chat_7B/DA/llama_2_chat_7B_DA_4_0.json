The alien did not visit Mars (premise)\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n3. Can we infer 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'?\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. If the alien did not visit Mars, then it is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter. However, if the alien visited Mars, it does not necessarily follow that the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot infer 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'.\nAnswer: no",
