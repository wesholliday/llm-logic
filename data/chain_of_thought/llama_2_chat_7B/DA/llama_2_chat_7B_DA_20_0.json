Conclusion: Therefore, the banana was not yellow (inferred from premises 1 and 2)\nNow, let me evaluate each premise and determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\nPremise 1: The apple was not red (given)\nThis premise is true, as we are given that the apple was not red.\nPremise 2: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (given)\nThis premise is also true, as we are given that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nConclusion: Therefore, the banana was not yellow (inferred from premises 1 and 2)\nSo, based on the given premises, we can logically conclude that the banana was not yellow.\nAnswer: yes",
