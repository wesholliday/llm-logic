Conclusion: Can we infer 'The pants were not denim'?\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\nIf the first premise is true (the shirt was not cotton), then the second premise becomes irrelevant, as there is no cotton shirt to which the second premise could apply. In other words, the second premise only makes sense if the shirt is cotton, but since the shirt was not cotton, the second premise does not apply.\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the pants were not denim.\nAnswer: yes",
