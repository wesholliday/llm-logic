Let's evaluate the first premise: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This premise is true, as there are only two possible locations for Fido: either he is inside or he must be in the garden.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nNow that we have evaluated the truth of each premise, we can determine the validity of the argument. To do this, we need to ask whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Fido is inside.\" Let's see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\nPremise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\nConclusion: Fido is inside.\nBased on the premises, it appears that the conclusion logically follows. Therefore, we can say that the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
