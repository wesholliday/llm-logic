In this case, let's analyze the conclusion: \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\nIf the first premise is true, then the only other option is that the shoes must be lined up by the door. However, the second premise states that this is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet, which means that the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
