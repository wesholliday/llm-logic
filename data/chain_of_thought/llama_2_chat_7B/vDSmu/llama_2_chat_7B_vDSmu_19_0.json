It simply states a logical dichotomy, which means that there are only two possible options for the location of the watch.\nPremise 2: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" - This premise is also valid. It negates the idea that the watch must be on the person's wrist, which means that there are other possible locations for the watch.\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\nBased on the evaluation of the premises, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\nAnswer: yes",
