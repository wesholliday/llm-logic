The first premise states that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper: either it's in the driveway or it's on the porch. The second premise negates the possibility that the newspaper must be on the porch. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway, which is the conclusion of the argument.",
