In this case, the premise \"The dreb was vroombed\" implies that the dreb was in a certain state, and the conclusion \"The dreb was spened\" implies that the dreb was in another state. Therefore, we need to determine if these two states are logically related.\nStep 4: Make a decision\nBased on the premises given, we cannot infer that the dreb was spened. The argument is invalid because the premise \"The dreb was vroombed\" does not necessarily imply that the dreb was spened. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: no'.",
