The flob did not move (conclusion)\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\nStep 1: If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not move\nReasoning: This premise is stating that if the flob had been skizzled, it would have meant that the flob was in a state of being frozen or immobile. Therefore, if the flob did not move, it means that it was not skizzled.\nStep 2: The flob did not move\nReasoning: This conclusion is based on the premise that the flob did not move.
