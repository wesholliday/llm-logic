If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed (conclusion)\nTo infer whether we can draw the conclusion from the premises, we need to follow the logical structure of the argument:\n1. If A, then not B.\n2. If B, then A.\nFrom the premises, we can see that the conclusion follows logically: if the splat was morphed (A), then it did not quank (not B). And if the splat quanked (B), then it was not morphed (A). Therefore, we can infer that if the splat quanked, then it did not morph.\nAnswer: yes",
