Conclusion: If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed (inferred)\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between them.\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which means that if the premise \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" is true, then the conclusion \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" must also be true.\nSo, to answer your question:\nAnswer: yes",
