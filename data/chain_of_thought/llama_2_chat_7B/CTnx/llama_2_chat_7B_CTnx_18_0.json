(Assumed to be true)\nPremise 2: The shank was not nugged. (Assumed to be true)\nStep 2: Apply the argument form\nThe argument form is a logical implication, which means that if the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true. In other words, if the shank was plooked, then it cannot have been nugged.\nStep 3: Conclude\nBased on the premises and the argument form, we can conclude that if the shank was plooked, then it was not nugged. Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
