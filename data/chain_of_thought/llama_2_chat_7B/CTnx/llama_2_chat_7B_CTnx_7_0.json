Conclusion: Therefore, the whiffle was not shanked.\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n1. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink. This means that if the whiffle had been hit with a sharp object (i.e., \"shanked\"), it would not have made a sound (i.e., \"tink\").\n2. The whiffle did tink. This means that the whiffle did make a sound, which contradicts the first premise.\n3. Therefore, the whiffle was not shanked. This conclusion follows logically from the two premises, as if the whiffle had been shanked, it would not have made a sound.\nSo, based on the argument provided, we can infer that if the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
