If the shipment lifted the zone, then the shipment was not shipped. (Premise 2)\n3. The shipment did not lift the zone. (Premise 3)\nFrom these premises, we can conclude:\n4. Therefore, the shipment was not shipped. (Conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning:\nThe argument is based on a logical deduction from the given premises. Premise 1 states that if the shipment was shipped, then it did not lift the zone. This means that if the shipment was shipped, it must have been unable to lift the zone. On the other hand, premise 2 states that if the shipment lifted the zone, then it was not shipped. This means that if the shipment lifted the zone, it must have been able to lift the zone because it was not shipped. Therefore, we can conclude that the shipment did not lift the zone, which means that it was not shipped.\nSo, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
