(Assumed to be true for the sake of the argument)\nPremise 2: If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged. (Given in the argument)\nStep 2: Apply the logical rules\nUsing the transitive property of inference, we can infer that if the wug was sproinged and it was not garpled, then it must be true that if the wug was garble, it was not sproinged.\nTherefore, our conclusion is:\nAnswer: yes",
