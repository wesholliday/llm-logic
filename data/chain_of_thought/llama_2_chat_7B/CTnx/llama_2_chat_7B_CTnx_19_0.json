Premise 2: If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled (given)\n3. Conclusion: If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\nNow, let's evaluate the argument step by step:\nStep 1: Identify the conclusion and premises\nConclusion: If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\nPremise 1: If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged.\nPremise 2: If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\nStep 2: Determine the type of argument\nThe argument is a logical deduction, which means it is an inference drawn from the premises to the conclusion using logical reasoning.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nTo evaluate the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises, so the argument is valid.\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nBased on the evaluation in step 3, the answer to the question \"Can we infer...?\" is yes. Therefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
