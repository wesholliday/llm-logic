This means that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal.\nPremise 2 states that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This means that if the truck is metal, the doll must be plastic.\nNow, let's assume that the doll was plastic and the truck was metal. Using Premise 1, we can conclude that the truck was metal. But using Premise 2, we can also conclude that the doll was plastic. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
