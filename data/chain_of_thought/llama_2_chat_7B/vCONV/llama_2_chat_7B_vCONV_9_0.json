Therefore, we need to evaluate whether the antecedent is true.\nIf Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\nThis means that if Mark purchased the blue shirt, then Lisa must have purchased the red shirt.\nStep 4: Determine the answer to the question.\nBased on our evaluation in step 3, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
