This means that there exists a situation where the car is red and the truck is blue.\nThe second premise states that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. This means that there exists a situation where the truck is blue and the car is red.\nSince both premises are true, we can conclude that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
