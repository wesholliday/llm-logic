            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument\nThe argument has two premises:\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Mary \u2192 Sue)\nPremise 2: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding (Sue \u2192 Mary)\nStep 2: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises\nThe conclusion of the argument is: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\nTo determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the argument form is valid. A valid argument form means that the conclusion logically follows directly from the premises without any unnecessary steps or assumptions.\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument form\nThe argument form of this argument is a logical implication, which is a valid form of argument. An implication is a logical relationship between two statements where if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. In this case, if Sue was at the wedding (premise 2), then Mary was at the wedding (conclusion).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
