Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a conditional statement. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because if the unicorn was in the forest (premise 1), then the griffin was also in the forest (premise 2). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
