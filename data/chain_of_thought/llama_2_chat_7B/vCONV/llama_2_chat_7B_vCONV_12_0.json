Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a conditional statement. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because if the first premise is true (Joe went to the park), then the second premise must also be true (Lucy went to the zoo). Therefore, the conclusion that Joe went to the park if Lucy went to the zoo can be deduced.",
