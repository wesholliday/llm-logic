A syllogism consists of three parts:\n1. All A are B\n2. Some C are B\n3. Therefore, some A are C\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. Based on these two premises, we can deduce the conclusion that some book written by James is a mystery novel.\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: yes",
