This means that there are only two possible locations for Fido - inside or outside (in the garden).\nStep 3: From the second premise, we can infer that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\nStep 4: Since we have established that there are only two possible locations for Fido - inside or outside (in the garden), and we have also established that Fido might not be in the garden, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
