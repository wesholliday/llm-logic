The premise \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the umbrella: either it's in the car or it's in the closet.\n2. The additional premise \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet\" tells us that we can't rule out the possibility that the umbrella is in the car.\n3. Therefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the umbrella is likely to be in the car.\nAnswer: yes",
