Premise 2: Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the pen is in my bag.\nNow, let me explain why I think this argument is valid and how we can infer 'The pen is in my bag' from the given premises:\nPremise 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk. This means that there are two possible locations for the pen: either it is in my bag or it is on my desk.\nPremise 2 tells us that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag. This means that if the pen might not be on my desk (according to Premise 1), then it must be in my bag (according to Premise 2).\nTherefore, based on these two premises, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag. So, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
