Premise 1: The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\nThis premise implies that there is a possibility that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, which means it could be somewhere else.\n2. Premise 2: Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\nThis premise states that there are only two possible locations for the phone: either it is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n3.
