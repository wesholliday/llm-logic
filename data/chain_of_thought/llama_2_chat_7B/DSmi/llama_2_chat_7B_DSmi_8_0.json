The premise \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the remote control: either it's on the coffee table or it's hiding under the couch.\n2. The additional premise \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" eliminates the possibility that the remote control is hiding under the couch, leaving us with only one possible location: the coffee table.\n3. Therefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the remote control is most likely to be found on the coffee table.\nAnswer: yes",
