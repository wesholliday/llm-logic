Premise 1: The watch might not be on his wrist.\nThis premise implies that there is a possibility that the watch is not on the person's wrist, which means it could be somewhere else.\n2. Premise 2: Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\nThis premise states that there are only two possible locations for the watch: either it is charging on the dresser or it is on the person's wrist.\n3. Conclusion: The watch is charging on the dresser.\nBased on the two premises, we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser because there is no other possible location for it. Therefore, our answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
