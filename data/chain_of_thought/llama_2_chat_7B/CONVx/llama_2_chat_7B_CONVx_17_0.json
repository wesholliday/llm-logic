If the flob moved, then the flob was skizzled (conclusion)\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion from the premise, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\nThe argument is an example of a valid inference, as the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The word \"then\" in the conclusion indicates that the second statement is a result or consequence of the first statement, which means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\nTherefore, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved.\nAnswer: yes",
