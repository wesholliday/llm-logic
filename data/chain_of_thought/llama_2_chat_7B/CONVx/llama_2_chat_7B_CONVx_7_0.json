In this case, the premise \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" implies that if the whiffle was shanked (i.e., had a sharp edge), it would tink (i.e., make a high-pitched sound). Therefore, the conclusion \"If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked\" logically follows from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
