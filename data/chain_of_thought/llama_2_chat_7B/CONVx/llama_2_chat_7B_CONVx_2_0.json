In other words, can we infer the conclusion from the premise?\nMy reasoning is as follows:\nThe word \"flopped\" in the premise means that the wug's ears are folded back against its head. The word \"bimmed\" means that the wug hit something with its nose.\nTherefore, if the wug was flooped (i.e., had its ears folded back), then it must have bimmed the zoint (i.e., hit something with its nose).\nSo, based on the premise and conclusion, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, then it bimmed the zoint.\nAnswer: yes",
