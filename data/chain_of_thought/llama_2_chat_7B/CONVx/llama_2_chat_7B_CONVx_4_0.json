In this case, the premise \"If the fribble was snurgled\" implies that the fribble underwent a certain state or action (snurgling). The second premise \"Then the fribble crinked\" implies that the fribble also underwent another state or action (crinking). Since both premises are related to the same object (the fribble), it is reasonable to conclude that if the fribble crinkled, then it was snurgled.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
