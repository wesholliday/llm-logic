In this case, the premise \"If the zinger was fraggled\" implies that the zinger has been damaged or altered in some way, and the premise \"then the zinger was smoogled\" suggests that the zinger is now in a state of disrepair or chaos. Therefore, if the zinger was not fraggled, it would not be in a state of disrepair or chaos, which means it was not smoogled.\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: yes",
