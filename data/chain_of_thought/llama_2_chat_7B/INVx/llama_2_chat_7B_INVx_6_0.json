It means that if a certain condition (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then another condition (the grommet plopping the frink) will also be true.\nStep 2: Identify the condition\nIn this sentence, the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" is the antecedent of the conditional clause \"then the grommet plopped the frink\".\nStep 3: Determine the logical outcome\nBased on the structure of the sentence, we can infer that if the grommet was not sploffed (i.e., the condition in the antecedent is false), then the grommet did not plop the frink (i.e., the consequence).\nAnswer: yes",
