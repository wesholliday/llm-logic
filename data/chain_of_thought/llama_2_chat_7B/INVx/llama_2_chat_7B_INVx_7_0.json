In this case, the premise \"If the whiffle was shanked\" implies that the whiffle was hit with a certain type of swing, and the premise \"then the whiffle tinked\" implies that the ball flew in a certain direction after being hit. Therefore, if the whiffle did not tink, it means that it was not shanked, which is the conclusion of the argument.\nAnswer: yes",
