In this case, the premise \"If the flugel was blimmed\" implies that the flugel underwent a certain action (blimming). The conclusion \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" logically follows from the premise, as the absence of blimming would imply the absence of zargling. Therefore, we can infer that if the flugel was not blimmed, it was not zargled.\nAnswer: yes",
