So, the negation of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\nStep 4: Evaluate the negation\nWe are asked to infer whether \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" can be inferred from the given statement. To do this, we need to compare the two statements and determine if they have the same logical structure.\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the analysis above, we can see that both statements have the same logical structure, with \"then\" serving as the connective between the two conditions. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\nAnswer: yes",
