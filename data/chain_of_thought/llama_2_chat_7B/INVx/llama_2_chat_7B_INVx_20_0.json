Conclusion: Therefore, it did not surn.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between them.\nThe argument is a valid form of reasoning known as modus ponens. This means that if the first premise is true and the second premise is false, then the conclusion must be true.\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
