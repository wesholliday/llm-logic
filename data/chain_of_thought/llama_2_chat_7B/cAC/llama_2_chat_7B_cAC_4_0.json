It is simply an assumption.\nStep 2: The fact that the robot visited Jupiter is a known and true statement.\nStep 3: From Step 2 and Step 1, we can conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This conclusion is also a known and true statement.\nBased on the above evaluation, my answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
