We don't know if it's true or not.\nStep 2: This is a premise that we are given. It's true by definition.\nStep 3: This is the conclusion that we want to draw. Based on the premises, can we conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt?\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, do we have enough information to know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt?\nBased on the given information, it seems that way. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, since they are mutually exclusive items (red and blue). Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt:\nAnswer: yes",
