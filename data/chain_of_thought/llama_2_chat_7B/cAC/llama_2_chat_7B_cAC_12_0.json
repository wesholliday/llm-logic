(premise 1)\nLucy went to the zoo. (premise 2)\nUsing logical reasoning, we can conclude that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must also be true. In this case, if Joe went to the park implies Lucy went to the zoo, and Lucy did go to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
