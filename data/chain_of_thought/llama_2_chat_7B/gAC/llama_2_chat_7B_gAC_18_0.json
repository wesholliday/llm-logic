            "content": "Okay, let me break down the argument step by step:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (premise 1)\n2. The truck was metal (premise 2)\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the doll was plastic (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\nThis statement is true because plastic and metal are mutually exclusive materials. A doll cannot be made of both plastic and metal at the same time. Therefore, if the doll is plastic, it means that the truck cannot be metal.\nPremise 2: The truck was metal\nThis statement is true based on the information provided in the argument.\nConclusion: Therefore, the doll was plastic\nNow, let me explain why this conclusion follows logically from the premises:\nIf the doll was plastic (premise 1), and the truck was metal (premise 2), then it logically follows that the doll was not metal. Since the truck was metal, and the doll was not metal, it means that the doll must have been plastic. Therefore, the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" logically follows from the premises.\nAnswer: yes",
