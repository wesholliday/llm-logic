Therefore, it follows that the dog was inside? (conclusion)\nTo determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the argument is valid or not. A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premises without any contradictions or absurdities.\nIn this case, let's analyze the conclusion: \"Therefore, it follows that the dog was inside.\" If the cat was outside, then the dog could have been inside, but we are given that the cat was outside. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dog was inside based solely on the premises provided.\nSo, the answer is:\nAnswer: no",
