So, we need to determine whether the first premise implies that the car had the property of being red.\nStep 5: Let's think about it... if the car had the property of being red, then it would have the same property as the truck (according to the first premise). Therefore, if the truck was blue, then the car must also be blue.\nStep 6: So, we can conclude that \"The car was red\" is true, given the two premises.\nAnswer: yes",
