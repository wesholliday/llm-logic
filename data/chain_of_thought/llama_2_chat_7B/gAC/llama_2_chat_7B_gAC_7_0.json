Therefore, Alex finished the race (conclusion)\nNow, let me explain my reasoning for each premise and the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\nPremise 2: Chris finished the race. This is the given statement, and we are asked to assume its truth for the purposes of the argument.\nConclusion: Therefore, Alex finished the race. Based on premises 1 and 2, if Chris finished the race (which we are assuming to be true), then Alex must have also finished the race.\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
