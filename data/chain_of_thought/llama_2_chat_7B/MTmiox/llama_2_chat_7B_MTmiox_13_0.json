It simply states that the glip might not have traveled.\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that if the glip was slogged (whatever that means), then it must have traveled.\nStep 3: Use the statements to draw a conclusion\nNow, let's use both statements together to draw a conclusion. If the glip was slogged, then it must have traveled. But we know from the first statement that the glip might not have traveled. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip did not travel.\nAnswer: yes",
