It is a possibility but not a certainty.\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if the flug was blummed (whatever that means), then it must have been zimmed. This implies that being blummed is a necessary condition for being zimmed.\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the flug was not blummed, then it was not zimmed. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer: yes",
