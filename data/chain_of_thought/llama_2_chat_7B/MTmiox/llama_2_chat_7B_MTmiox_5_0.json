It only suggests that it might not have been smoogled.\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\nStep 3: Use the statements to draw a conclusion\nBased on the second statement, if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. Since we know that the zinger might not have been smoogled (according to the first statement), we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\nAnswer: yes",
