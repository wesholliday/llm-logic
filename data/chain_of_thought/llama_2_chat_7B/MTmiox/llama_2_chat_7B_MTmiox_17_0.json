From the second premise, if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. Therefore, we can infer that if the flob was not skizzled, then it did not move.\nStep 3: Determine the answer to the question\nBased on the above reasoning, we can conclude that \"The flob was not skizzled\" and therefore \"The flob did not move\".\nAnswer: yes",
