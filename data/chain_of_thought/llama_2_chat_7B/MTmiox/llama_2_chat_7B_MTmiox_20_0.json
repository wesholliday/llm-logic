It only suggests that the fleeg might not have been surned.\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\nStep 3: Use the statements to draw a conclusion\nNow, let's use both statements together to draw a conclusion. If the fleeg was bluttered (according to the second statement), and it must have been surned (according to the first statement), then we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\nAnswer: yes",
