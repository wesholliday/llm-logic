It only suggests that the shank might not have been nugged.\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\nStep 3: Use the statements to draw a conclusion\nNow, let's use both statements together to draw a conclusion. If the shank was plooked (according to the second statement), and the shank might not have been nugged (according to the first statement), then we can conclude that the shank was not nugged.\nAnswer: yes",
