It only suggests that the grommet might not have done so.\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that if the grommet was sploffed (whatever that means), then it must have plopped the frink.\nStep 3: Use the information from both statements to make an inference about the grommet's behavior\nBased on the second statement, if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. However, we cannot conclude that the grommet was sploffed based on the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet did not sploff itself and therefore did not plop the frink.\nAnswer: yes",
