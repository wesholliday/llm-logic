In this case, since \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\", and \"The clug might not have been snugged\", it means that if the clug was fleeked, it would have been snugged. However, we are given that the clug might not have been snugged, which implies that the clug was not fleeked. Therefore, the conclusion \"The clug was not fleeked\" logically follows from the premises, and our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
