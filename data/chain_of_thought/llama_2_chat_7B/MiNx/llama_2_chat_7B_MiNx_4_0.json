Here is my reasoning:\nStep 1: Identify the premise of the argument\nThe argument is based on the following premise: \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\"\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion\nThe conclusion that can be inferred from the premise is: \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\"\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nBased on the premise and conclusion, we can evaluate the strength of the argument as follows:\n* If the premise is true, then the conclusion is also true.\n* If the premise is false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\nTherefore, to determine whether we can infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from \"The fribble might not have been snurgled,\" we need to evaluate the truth of the premise.\nStep 4: Provide the answer\nBased on my evaluation, I conclude that the argument is valid and the conclusion can be inferred from the premise. Therefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
