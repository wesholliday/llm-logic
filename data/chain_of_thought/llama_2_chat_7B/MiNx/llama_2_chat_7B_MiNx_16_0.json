The statement is \"The sneg might not have been crampled.\"\n2. If the sneg might not have been crampled, it means that there is a possibility that the sneg was not cramped.\n3. If there is a possibility that the sneg was not cramped, then it's not the case that the sneg must have been cramped.\n4.
