Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\nStep 1: Identify the premise of the argument\nThe argument is based on the premise \"The glip might not have been slogged.\"\nStep 2: Consider the possible conclusions that can be drawn from the premise\nFrom the premise, we can infer two possible conclusions:\nConclusion 1: It's possible that the glip was not slogged.\nConclusion 2: It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged.\nStep 3: Evaluate the strength of each conclusion based on the premise\nConclusion 1 is stronger than Conclusion 2 because it simply states that the glip might not have been slogged, while Conclusion 2 goes further to say that it's not the case that the glip must have been slogged.\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the strength of the conclusions\nSince Conclusion 1 is stronger than Conclusion 2, we can infer that \"It's possible that the glip was not slogged\" and \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged.\" Therefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
