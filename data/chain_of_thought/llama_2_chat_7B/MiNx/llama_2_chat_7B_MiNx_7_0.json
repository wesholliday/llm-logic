Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe statement is \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"\nStep 2: Identify the logical operators involved\nThe statement contains two logical operators: \"might\" and \"not.\"\nStep 3: Determine the scope of each operator\n* \"Might\" implies a possibility or an uncertainty about the whiffle being shanked. It does not necessarily imply that the whiffle was shanked.\n* \"Not\" negates the idea that the whiffle was shanked.\nStep 4: Draw conclusions based on the operators' scopes\nGiven the scope of the logical operators, we can conclude that:\n* It is possible (or might be) that the whiffle was not shanked.\n* It is not the case (or not) that the whiffle must have been shanked.\nStep 5: Summarize and answer the question\nBased on our analysis, we can answer the question as follows:\nAnswer: yes",
