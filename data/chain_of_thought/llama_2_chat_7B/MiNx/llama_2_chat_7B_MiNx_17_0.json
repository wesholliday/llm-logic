Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\nStep 1: Understand the meaning of \"skizzled\" in the context of the sentence. Based on the provided sentence, it seems that \"skizzled\" is a verb that means something like \"to completely destroy or eliminate something.\"\nStep 2: Identify the subject of the sentence. The subject of the sentence is \"the flob.\"\nStep 3: Determine the scope of the statement. Based on the sentence, we can infer that the statement is making a claim about the flob, i.e., it's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\nStep 4: Evaluate the logical implications of the statement. If the flob was not skizzled, then it must still exist or have existed at some point in time. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\"\nTherefore, my answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
