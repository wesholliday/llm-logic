Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\nStep 1: Identify the premise of the argument\nThe argument is based on the following premise: \"The wug might not have been sproinged.\"\nStep 2: Consider the meaning of the words involved\n* \"Wug\" refers to an unspecified entity.\n* \"Sproinged\" means to cause something to become sprung or stretched.\nStep 3: Evaluate the logical implications of the premise\nGiven the premise \"The wug might not have been sproinged,\" we can infer that it's possible (or even likely) that the wug has not been sproinged. This means that the statement \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" is true, as there is no logical necessity for the wug to have been sproinged in the first place.\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the above analysis\nTherefore, our answer is:\nAnswer: yes",
