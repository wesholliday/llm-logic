We know that \"if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement where the presence of the dog inside implies the absence of the cat outside.\n2. However, we don't have enough information to conclude that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be not outside. There could be other possibilities - for example, the cat might be in another part of the house or somewhere else entirely.\n3. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
