In logic, this does not allow us to directly infer \"if not p, then not q\". This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n3. So, even though it might seem intuitive or likely, we cannot definitively say that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
