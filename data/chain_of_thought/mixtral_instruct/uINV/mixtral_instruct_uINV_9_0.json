            "content": " Let's think through this:\n\n1. The given statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". \n   - Here, P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\n2. The question now asks if we can infer \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q).\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a true conditional statement is also true. \n\nSo, if Lisa buying the red shirt implies that Mark bought the blue shirt, then it follows that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
