            "content": " Let's think through this:\n\n1. The given statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q,\" where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n2. We are now asked if, given this information, we can infer that \"if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This is a contrapositive statement of the original conditional statement.\n3. The truth of a conditional statement does imply the truth of its contrapositive. \n4. However, we cannot definitively say that the contrapositive is true based solely on the given information. We do not know if Joe's visit to the park is required for Lucy to go to the zoo. It could be that Lucy goes to the zoo regardless of whether Joe goes to the park.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.",
