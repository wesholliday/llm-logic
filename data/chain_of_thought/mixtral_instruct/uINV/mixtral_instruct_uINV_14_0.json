We know that \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This is a conditional statement known as a hypothesis (the 'if' part) implying its consequent (the 'then' part).\n2. However, we don't know if the converse is true - i.e., \"if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" This statement isn't provided or implied by the original statement.\n3. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: No.",
