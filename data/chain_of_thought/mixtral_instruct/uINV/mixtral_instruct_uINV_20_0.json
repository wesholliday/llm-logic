We know that \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement known as a hypothesis (the 'if' part) and conclusion (the 'then' part).\n2. Now we want to consider the opposite of the hypothesis: \"if the apple was not red.\"\n3. To determine if the conclusion follows, we need to think about whether there could be any exceptions or alternative possibilities where the apple is not red but the banana is still yellow.\n4. However, since the original statement only provides information about when the apple is red and its corresponding outcome for the banana, it does not give us enough information to conclude what happens when the apple is not red.\n5. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
