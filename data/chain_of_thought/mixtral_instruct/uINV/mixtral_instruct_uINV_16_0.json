In this case, we don't know what the material of the pants is because the given statement only tells us about the relationship between cotton shirts and denim pants.\n\n2) There is no information provided about any pairings except for cotton shirts with denim pants.\n\nSince there is no information suggesting that non-cotton shirts are always paired with non-denim pants, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: No.",
