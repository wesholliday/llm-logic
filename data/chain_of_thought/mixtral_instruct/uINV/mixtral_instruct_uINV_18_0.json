We know that \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement where the doll being plastic implies the truck being metal.\n2. However, we don't have information about what happens when the doll is not plastic. In logic, when there's no explicit information about the opposite case, we cannot make assumptions.\n3. Therefore, without further information, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: No.",
