We know that \"if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, often written as \"Vampire awake -> Mummy awake\" (where '->' represents 'implies').\n2. However, just because the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, it doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire not being awake implies the mummy not being awake. \n3. This is because there could be other factors at play that we don't know about - for example, maybe the mummy wakes up regardless of whether the vampire is awake or not.\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
