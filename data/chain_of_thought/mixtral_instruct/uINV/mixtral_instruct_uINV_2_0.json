We know that \"if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. However, we don't know if the presence of the griffin is the only condition for the unicorn to be in the forest. It could be that the unicorn is always in the forest, regardless of whether the griffin is there or not.\n3. Without more information about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, we cannot definitively say that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
