            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. We know that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue was also there. This is called a conditional statement and can be written as \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. However, just because we know that if A is true, then B is also true, it doesn't necessarily mean that if A is false, then B must be false as well. This is a different scenario, which can be written as \"If not A, then not B.\"\n3. In this case, since the original statement only tells us about the relationship between A and B when A is true, we cannot infer anything conclusive about what happens when A is false.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether Sue would not have been at the wedding if Mary hadn't attended.\n\nAnswer: No.",
