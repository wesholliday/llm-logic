We know that \"if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement known as an implication or a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. However, we don't have enough information to conclude the converse of this statement, which would be \"if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n3. The original statement only tells us what happens when Tom watches football, but it doesn't specify what happens when he doesn't.\n4. It is possible that even if Tom didn't watch football, Jen could still have watched basketball. We cannot make a definitive conclusion without more information about their viewing habits.\n\nAnswer: No.",
