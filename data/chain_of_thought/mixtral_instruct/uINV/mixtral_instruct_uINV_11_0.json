We know that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is called a conditional statement and can be written as: C -> B, where C represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and B represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. Now we want to determine if \"if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This is another conditional statement that can be written as: ~C -> ~B, where ~C represents \"the cake was not chocolate\" and ~B represents \"the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\n3. From the given information, we cannot directly infer ~C -> ~B because there could be situations where the cake is not chocolate but the muffins are still blueberry. The original statement only tells us about one possible scenario (C -> B), not all possible scenarios.\n\nTherefore, Answer: no.",
