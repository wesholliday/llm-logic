However, we are now asked to consider the opposite scenario - what if Alex did not finish the race?\n3. The given statement does not tell us anything about what happens when Alex doesn't finish the race. It only tells us about when Alex finishes.\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine whether Chris would or wouldn't finish the race if Alex didn't.\n\nAnswer: No.",
