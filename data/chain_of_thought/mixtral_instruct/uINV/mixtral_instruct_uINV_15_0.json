However, we don't have any information about what happens if Sam doesn't take a plane. In other words, we don't know whether there's a connection between Sam not taking a plane and Erin not taking a train.\n3. It could be that Erin only takes the train when Sam takes the plane (maybe they're traveling together), but it could also be that she has her own means of transportation and takes it regardless of what Sam does.\n4. Without further information, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No.",
