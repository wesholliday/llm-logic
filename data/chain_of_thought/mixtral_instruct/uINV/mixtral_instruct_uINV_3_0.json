The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is in the form of an implication (also known as a conditional statement).\n2. This implies that if the book was not written by James, we cannot directly infer whether it is or isn't a mystery novel since there could be other authors who write mystery novels too.\n3. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot make the inference that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No.",
