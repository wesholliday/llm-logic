It is also stated that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, which means the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet as dangling items has been ruled out.\n3. Since we only have two options for the location of the keys (drawer or cabinet), and one option (dangling in the cabinet) has been eliminated, by process of elimination, the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
