This means that there are only two possible locations for the pen - your bag or your desk.\n2. Then you mentioned that it's not the case that the pen must be on your desk. This implies that the pen cannot definitely be found on your desk, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of the pen being on your desk entirely.\n3. Based on these statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in your bag because there remains a possibility that the pen could still be on your desk.\n\nAnswer: No.",
