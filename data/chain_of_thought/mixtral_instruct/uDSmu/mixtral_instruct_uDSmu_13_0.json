It is also stated that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, which means the toy could still potentially be there, but it isn't required to be there.\n3. Since we have no information suggesting the toy's location other than these two possibilities, and one of those options (the toy being on the bookshelf) has been explicitly stated as not necessarily true, we can infer that the remaining option is likely where the toy is.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
