However, we are also told that it's not necessarily the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This statement implies that there could be a situation where the missing puzzle piece is neither in the box nor blending in on the floor.\n3. But since our original options were exhaustive (either in the box or blending in on the floor), and we now know that there can be a situation where it's neither, this means that the initial assumption about the missing puzzle piece being in one of those two places was flawed.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: No.",
