You also told us that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n3. From point 2, we can infer that there is no obligation for the scarf to be on the coat rack, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the scarf being there.\n4. However, since we only have two options and one of them has been ruled out (the scarf being obligated to be on the coat rack), and considering that you didn't mention any other location for the scarf, we can infer that the remaining option is true by process of elimination.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
