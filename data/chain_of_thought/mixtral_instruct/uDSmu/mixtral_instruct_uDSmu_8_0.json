We know that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch (but not both at the same time).\n2. The statement \"it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that there is a possibility that the remote control could be somewhere else, but it does not necessarily mean it is on the coffee table.\n3. Since we only have two options given (coffee table or under the couch), and we know for sure that it cannot be under the couch, then by process of elimination, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
