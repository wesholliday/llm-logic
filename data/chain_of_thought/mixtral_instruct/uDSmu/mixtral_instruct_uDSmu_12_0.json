We are also told that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, which means there is at least one other possibility for the jacket (i.e., it could be somewhere else or we might not know where it is).\n3. However, just because the jacket doesn't have to be hanging in the closet doesn't necessarily mean that it is draped over the chair. It could be located anywhere else.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based on the given information.",
