This gives us two possible locations for the missing sock.\n2. It is not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed, which means there is a possibility that the missing sock could still be somewhere else other than under the bed.\n3. However, since we only have two possible locations for the missing sock (laundry basket or under the bed), and it has been confirmed that the missing sock does not have to be under the bed, then by process of elimination, the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
