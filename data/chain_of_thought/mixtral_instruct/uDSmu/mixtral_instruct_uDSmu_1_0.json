This is a statement of exhaustive possibilities, meaning one of these two things must be true.\n2. It's also stated that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This negates the second possibility from our initial statement.\n3. Since the second possibility has been ruled out, by process of elimination, the first possibility must be true.\n4. Therefore, Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
