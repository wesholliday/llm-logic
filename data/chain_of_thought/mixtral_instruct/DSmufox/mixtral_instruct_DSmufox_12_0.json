We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\" and \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the smip to be lupped, which means that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped.\n3. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the smip to be lupped, we can conclude that the second possibility in the second statement must be true: the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
