We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the wug must be garbled\" and \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged\".\n2. The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the wug to be garbled, meaning there are other possibilities besides garbling.\n3. The second statement presents two options: either the wug must be garbled or it is sproinged. Since we know from the first statement that the wug doesn't have to be garbled, we can eliminate that option.\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that \"the wug is sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
