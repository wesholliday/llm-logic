We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" and \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked\".\n2. The first statement \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" means that there is no obligation or requirement for the shank to be nugged. It could still be nugged, but it doesn't have to be.\n3. The second statement \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked\" presents us with two possibilities: either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that there is no obligation for the shank to be nugged, we can rule out the first possibility in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that \"the shank is plooked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
