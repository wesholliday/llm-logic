We are given two statements:\n   a) It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n   b) Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\n2. The first statement (a) tells us that the zinger does not necessarily have to be smoogled; there are other possibilities for the zinger's state.\n\n3. The second statement (b) presents two options: either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. Since we know from statement (a) that the zinger doesn't have to be smoogled, we can eliminate the first option in statement (b).\n\n4. With the first option eliminated, only one possibility remains: the zinger is fraggled.\n\nNow that we've thought through the problem step by step, we can provide our answer:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
