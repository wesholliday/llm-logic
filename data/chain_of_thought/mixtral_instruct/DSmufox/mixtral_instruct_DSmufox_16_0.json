We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" and \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\".\n2. The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the sneg to be sprotet, which means that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sprotet.\n3. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the sneg to not be sprotet, we can conclude that the second part of the second statement must be true: the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
