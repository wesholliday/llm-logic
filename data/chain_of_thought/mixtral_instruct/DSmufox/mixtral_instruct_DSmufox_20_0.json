We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" and \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\".\n2. The first statement tells us that the fleeg does not need to be surned, which means that the second part of the second statement (\"it is bluttered\") must be true because the whole disjunction needs to be true.\n3. Therefore, we can indeed infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
