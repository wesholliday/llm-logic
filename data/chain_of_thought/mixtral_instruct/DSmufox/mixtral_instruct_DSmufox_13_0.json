We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" and \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\".\n2. The first statement \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" means that there is no necessity for the glip to be tragged, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the glip being tragged.\n3. The second statement \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\" presents two options: either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that there is no necessity for the glip to be tragged, we can consider the second option in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
