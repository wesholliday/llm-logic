We know that \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\" which means that it is possible for the fribble to exist without being crinkled.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true.\n3. Since we know from point 1 that it's possible for the fribble to exist without being crinkled, the first part of the disjunction \"the fribble must be crinked\" cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, since one part of the disjunction must be true, the second part \"it is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
