We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" and \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\".\n2. The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the flob to be movated, which means that there are possible situations where the flob is not movated.\n3. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled. Since we know from the first statement that the flob does not have to be movated, this leaves us with the second possibility: the flob being skizzled.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements and our reasoning, we can indeed infer 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
