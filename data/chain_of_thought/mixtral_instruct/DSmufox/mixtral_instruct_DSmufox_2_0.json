We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\" and \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\"\n2. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed,\" means that there is no necessity for the wug to be bimmed; it could be unbimmed or have some other state.\n3. The second statement, \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped,\" presents us with two possibilities: either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that there is no necessity for the wug to be bimmed, we can rule out the first possibility in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
