We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" and \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\"\n2. The first statement means that there is no requirement for the sprocket to be daggled; it could be in some other state.\n3. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket does not have to be daggled, we can rule out the first possibility in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that \"the sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
