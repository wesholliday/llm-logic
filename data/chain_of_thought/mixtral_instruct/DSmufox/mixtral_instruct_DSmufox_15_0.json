We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spent\" and \"Either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed\".\n2. The first statement tells us that the dreb does not necessarily need to be spent.\n3. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: either the dreb must be spent, or it is vroombed.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the dreb doesn't have to be spent, we can eliminate the first possibility in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is \"it is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
