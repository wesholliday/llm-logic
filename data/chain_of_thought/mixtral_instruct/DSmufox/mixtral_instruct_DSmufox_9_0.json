We have the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This means that it is possible for the twonk to not be plinked.\n2. Next, we have the statement \"Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished.\" This is a disjunction (an 'or' statement), which can be broken down into two cases:\n   a) The twonk must be plinked.\n   b) The twonk is varnished.\n3. From the first statement, we know that option a) is not necessarily true because it's possible for the twonk to not be plinked.\n4. Therefore, since one of the two options in our disjunction must be true, and option a) cannot be true based on the information given, then option b) must be true: The twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
