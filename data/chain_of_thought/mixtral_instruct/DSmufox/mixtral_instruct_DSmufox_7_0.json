We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked\" and \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\"\n2. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked,\" means that there is no obligation or requirement for the whiffle to be tinked. It could still be tinked, but it doesn't have to be.\n3. The second statement, \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked,\" presents two possibilities: either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. Since we know from the first statement that there is no requirement for the whiffle to be tinked, we can eliminate that possibility.\n4. Therefore, since the only remaining possibility in the second statement is that \"it is shanked,\" and there are no other options presented, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
