If it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race, then there is a possibility that he did not finish the race. This can be expressed as Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nA logically valid argument is one where the truth of the premise(s) guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, since the negation of 'must' implies 'might not', the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
