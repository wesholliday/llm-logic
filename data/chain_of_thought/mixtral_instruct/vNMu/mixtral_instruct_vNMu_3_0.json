In this case, if it's not true that the book must have been written by James, then there is room for the possibility that the book was not written by James.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument form is logically valid.\nThe logical structure of the argument is not perfectly valid because the negation of a necessity claim does not strictly imply a possibility claim. However, it is very close to being valid and is often treated as such in everyday reasoning. This type of argument is called a \"plausible argument\" or an argument with \"practical validity.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes, the form of argument is logically plausible and practically valid.",
