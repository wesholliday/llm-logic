This implies that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag.\n2. The conclusion then restates this possibility, stating that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nThe argument form is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. If it's possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag (as stated by the premise), then indeed, the sunglasses might not be in her bag (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
