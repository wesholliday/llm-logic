In this case, \"It's not necessary that the shoes must be in the closet\" implies \"It's possible that the shoes are not in the closet,\" which can be restated as \"The shoes might not be in the closet.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
