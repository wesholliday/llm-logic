            "content": "Step 1: Identify the logical form of the argument. The logical form of the argument is:\n\nPremise: Not (Mary must have been at the wedding)\nConclusion: Mary might not have been at the wedding\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical relationship between the premise and conclusion. In this case, the negation of \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that there is a possibility that she was not at the wedding. This can be expressed as \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise(s). In this case, the negation of \"Must\" implies \"Might not,\" so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
