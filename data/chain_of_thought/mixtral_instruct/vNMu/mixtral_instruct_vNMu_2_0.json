This possibility does not exclude other possibilities, such as the griffin being in the forest or being extinct.\n3. Therefore, saying that \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that \"the griffin might not have been in the forest.\"\n4. The argument is not logically valid because the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
