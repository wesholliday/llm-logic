In other words, \"It's not the case that X must be true\" implies \"X might not be true.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument follows a logically valid form.\nIn this case, the logical structure of the argument is as follows:\n1. Not (Alien must have visited Mars)\n2. Therefore, Alien might not have visited Mars\n\nThis argument follows the logically valid form of modus tollens in modal logic, where the necessity operator (\"must\") is replaced by its corresponding possibility operator (\"might not\").\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes",
