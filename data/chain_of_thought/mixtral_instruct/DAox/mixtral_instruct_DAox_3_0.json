The second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. \n3. In this case, if the condition (the splat being morphed) is not met, then the consequence (the splat quanking) does not necessarily follow.\n4. Since we know that the splat was not morphed, the condition of the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the splat quanked or not based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
