We also know that \"if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" exists as a conditional statement.\n3. However, since we know that \"the sneg was not crampled,\" this means that the condition of the if-then statement has not been met.\n4. Since the condition has not been met, we cannot make any conclusions about the second part of the if-then statement, which is \"then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
