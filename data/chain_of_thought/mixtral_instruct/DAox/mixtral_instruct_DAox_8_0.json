And we have the conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. To determine if \"the sprocket was not daggled\" is a valid inference, let's examine whether the given information contradicts this possibility.\n4. Since we know that the sprocket was not cranked, and the condition only applies when the sprocket is cranked, there is no information provided about what happens to the sprocket when it is not cranked.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether \"the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
