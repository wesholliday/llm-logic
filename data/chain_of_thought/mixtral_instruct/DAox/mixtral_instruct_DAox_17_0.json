From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The flob was not movated'. \n4. This is because even if the flob wasn't skizzled, it doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't movated. The second statement only tells us that if the flob were skizzled, then it would have movated. But since we know it wasn't skizzled, this conditional statement does not apply here.\n\nAnswer: No.",
