From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"the clug was not snugged\" because the given conditional statement only tells us what happens when the clug is fleeked. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the clug isn't fleeked.\n4. In other words, just because the clug wasn't fleeked, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wasn't snugged. There could be other reasons for the clug to have been snugged or not snugged.\n\nAnswer: No.",
