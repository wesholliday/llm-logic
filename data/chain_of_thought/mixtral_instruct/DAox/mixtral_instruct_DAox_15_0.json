This conditional statement is in the form of a hypothetical syllogism, which means it's an \"if-then\" statement.\n4. Given that the condition (the dreb being vroombed) is not met, we cannot make any conclusions about the consequence (the dreb being spened).\n5. In other words, since the dreb was not vroombed, the rule \"If the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened\" does not apply in this case.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The dreb was not spened' based on the given information.",
