From these two statements, we want to infer whether 'The whiffle did not tink'.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it would have tinked.\n5. However, since we know from the first statement that 'The whiffle was not shanked', this means that the condition of the second statement is not met.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether the whiffle tinked or not because the condition for it to tink (i.e., being shanked) was not met.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The whiffle did not tink' from the given statements.",
