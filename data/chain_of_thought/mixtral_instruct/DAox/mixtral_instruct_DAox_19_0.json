From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"the smonk was not plagged\" because there is no explicit connection between the smonk being not vreebled and it not plagging.\n4. The given conditional statement only tells us what happens if the smonk is vreebled, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the smonk is not vreebled.\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine whether the smonk was or was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: No.",
