It means that if the condition (the fleeg being bluttered) is true, then the consequence (it surned) must also be true.\n\nNow let's consider whether we can infer 'The fleeg did not surn' based on these statements:\n\nSince the first statement explicitly tells us that \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" the condition in the second statement is false. According to the rules of logic, if the condition in an \"if-then\" statement is false, then the entire statement becomes vacuously true, meaning it doesn't provide any information about the truth value of the consequence.\n\nIn this case, since we don't have enough information to determine whether the fleeg surned or not based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'The fleeg did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
