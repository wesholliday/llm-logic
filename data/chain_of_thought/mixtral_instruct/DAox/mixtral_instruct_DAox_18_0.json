We also know that \"if the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". \n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that \"the shank was not nugged\". This is because the second statement only tells us what would happen if the shank were plooked. It does not give any information about what happens when the shank is not plooked. Therefore, it's possible that the shank could still be nugged even if it wasn't plooked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
