We also know that \"if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n3. From these two statements, we want to infer whether \"the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n4. Since we already know that \"the smip was not shripped,\" it means the condition for the second statement has not been met.\n5. Therefore, even though the second statement tells us that if the smip were shripped, it would have lupped the zoint, this does not necessarily mean that the smip did lup the zoint because we don't know if the condition was ever met.\n6. In fact, since \"the smip was not shripped,\" there is no reason to assume that \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The smip did not lup the zoint' from these statements alone.",
