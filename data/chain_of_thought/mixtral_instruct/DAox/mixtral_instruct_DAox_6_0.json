We also know that \"if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether the grommet plopped the frink or not because there is no explicit information about the grommet plopping the frink when it did not sploff.\n4. The given conditional statement only applies if the grommet was sploffed, which we know didn't happen.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that \"the grommet did not plop the frink\" based on the provided information.",
