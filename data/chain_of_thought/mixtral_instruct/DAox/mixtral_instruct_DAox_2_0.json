The second statement tells us, \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"the wug did not bim the zoint\" because there is no information given about whether or not the wug bimmed the zoint when it wasn't flooped.\n4. The second statement only provides a conditional relationship between flooping and bimming the zoint, but it doesn't cover all possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: No.",
