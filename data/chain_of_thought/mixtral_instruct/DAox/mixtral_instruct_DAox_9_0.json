The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (in this case, the twonk being plinked) is true.\n4. However, since we already know that the twonk was not plinked, the condition of the second statement is false.\n5. When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement becomes true by default, but it doesn't provide any information about whether the twonk was varnished or not.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"the twonk was not varnished\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
