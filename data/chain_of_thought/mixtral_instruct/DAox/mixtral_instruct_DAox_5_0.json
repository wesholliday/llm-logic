Since we now know that the zinger is not fraggled, we cannot use the second statement to infer anything about whether the zinger is smoogled or not. This is because the condition (the zinger being fraggled) stated in the second sentence is not met.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether the zinger was smoogled or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
