We also know that \"if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"the flugel was not zargled\" because the given conditional statement only applies when the flugel is blimmed.\n4. Since the flugel is not blimmed, the condition stated in the second sentence does not apply here.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that \"the flugel was not zargled\" based on the given statements.",
