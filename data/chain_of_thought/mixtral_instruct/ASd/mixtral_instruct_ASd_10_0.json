This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\", where p represents 'the order is placed' and q represents 'the item will ship'.\n3. Now, we want to determine if the following statement can be inferred: \"If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship.\"\n4. This new statement introduces an additional condition (the item being out of stock) that was not present in the original statement.\n5. The presence of this new condition makes it impossible to infer the truth of the second statement from the first one because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the item is out of stock.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship\" based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
