The original statement is \"If I change the oil, the car will run smoothly.\" This implies that changing the oil is a sufficient condition for the car to run smoothly.\n2. However, it does not tell us whether a shot transmission has any impact on the car running smoothly after an oil change. \n3. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that even if the transmission is shot, changing the oil will ensure the car runs smoothly.\n4. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
