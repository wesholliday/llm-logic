We cannot infer that if the match is struck and soaked in water, it will still light because the original statement does not account for external factors like the match being wet.\n3. The truth of the original statement only implies that under normal circumstances, striking the match will cause it to light.\n4. Adding an additional condition (the match being soaked in water) changes the scenario and is not covered by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
