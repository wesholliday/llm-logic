The original statement only mentions studying hard and passing the test. It does not specify any conditions about the language of the test.\n2. Adding a new condition (the test being in Chinese) to the premise changes the meaning of the implication.\n3. Without further information regarding the individual's proficiency in Chinese or their ability to pass tests in that language, we cannot infer that studying hard will result in passing a Chinese language test.\n\nAnswer: No.",
