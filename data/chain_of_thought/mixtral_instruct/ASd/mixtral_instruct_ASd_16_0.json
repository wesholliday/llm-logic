The condition here is 'fertilizing the lawn.'\n\nStep 3: Now consider the proposed inferred statement - \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\"\n\nStep 4: Analyze this statement for its conditions. There are two conditions here: 'fertilizing the lawn' and 'there being a drought.'\n\nStep 5: Compare these conditions with those in the given statement. While the first condition (fertilizing the lawn) is present in both statements, the second condition (drought) is not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nStep 6: Consider how this new condition might affect the outcome of the statement. A drought typically causes problems for plant growth due to lack of water.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we cannot infer that 'If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green' because the original statement does not account for potential adverse effects of other conditions like droughts.\n\nAnswer: No.",
