The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog is in the yard, then it is barking.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"the dog is in the yard\" and Q represents \"it is barking.\"\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the new conditional statement: \"If the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is barking.\" This can be represented as (P ^ R) -> Q, where R represents \"it is asleep.\"\n3. To infer the new statement from the original one, we would need to know that being in the yard and sleeping implies barking (i.e., P ^ R -> Q). However, the original statement only tells us that if the dog is in the yard, it is barking. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the dog is both in the yard and asleep.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer the new conditional statement based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
