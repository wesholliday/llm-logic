            "content": " Step 1: Identify the given statement - \"If I take medication, I will feel better.\"\nStep 2: Analyze the structure of the given statement. It is in the form of a hypothetical conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. The condition (if part) is \"I take medication,\" and the consequence (then part) is \"I will feel better.\"\nStep 3: Identify the logical operator connecting the two parts of the given statement - in this case, it is implication (\u2192).\nStep 4: Consider whether taking expired medication leads to feeling better. Expired medication may not have the same potency or effectiveness as non-expired medication and could potentially cause harm.\nStep 5: Recognize that the original statement does not account for exceptions, such as taking expired medication.\nStep 6: Conclude that we cannot infer 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better' from the given statement because it introduces an exception to the condition.\n\nAnswer: No.",
