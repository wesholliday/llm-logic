In this case, the calories consumed from eating junk food might outweigh the calories burned through exercise, potentially leading to weight gain or preventing weight loss rather than causing weight loss.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, based on our analysis, we cannot infer that if someone exercises and eats junk food, they will lose weight.\n\nAnswer: No.",
