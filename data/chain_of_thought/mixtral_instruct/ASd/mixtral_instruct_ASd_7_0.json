            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement, which states that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\n2. However, the second statement introduces a new condition - the pilot light being out. This additional condition changes the scenario described in the first statement.\n3. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the second statement because it includes an extra condition that was not present in the initial statement.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm' from 'If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
