If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\n\nThis statement is in the form of an implication, where if the condition (the package has shipped) is true, then the consequence (it will arrive today) follows. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the package is misrouted.\n\nNow let's consider the proposed statement:\n\n2. If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\n\nThis statement introduces a new condition (it was misrouted) that wasn't present in the original statement. The truth of this new condition does not necessarily follow from the original statement because there is no information provided about how misrouting affects the delivery time.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer the proposed statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
