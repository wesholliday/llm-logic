The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' tells us that if a certain condition is met (the doll being plastic), then a consequence follows (the truck being metal).\n4. However, it does not tell us whether or not the condition is actually met - it only establishes a relationship between the condition and the consequence.\n5. Since we already know that 'The truck was metal' independently of this conditional statement, this information doesn't help us determine whether or not the condition (the doll being plastic) is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
