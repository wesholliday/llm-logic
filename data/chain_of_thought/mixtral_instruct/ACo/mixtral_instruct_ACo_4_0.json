We also know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (let's call this statement I).\n\nWhat we want to find out is whether the alien visited Mars (let's call this statement A).\n\nFrom statement I alone, we cannot directly infer that A is true because it only tells us about a relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter. It does not explicitly state that the alien visited Mars.\n\nHowever, given R and I together, we can conclude that A is indeed true. Here's why:\n\n- If A were false (meaning the alien did not visit Mars), then statement I would be false as well because its condition would not be met. But since we know R is true, having both R and a false I contradicts our initial information.\n- Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, A must be true (the alien visited Mars).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
