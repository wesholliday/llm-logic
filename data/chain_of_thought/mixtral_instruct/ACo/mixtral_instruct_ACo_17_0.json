We also know that if 'Ben ate pasta' is true, then 'Kate ate salad' must be true (from the second statement).\n3. However, just because 'Kate ate salad' is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that 'Ben ate pasta' is true. It could be the case that Ben didn't eat pasta and Kate still ate salad for some other reason.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer that 'Ben ate pasta'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
