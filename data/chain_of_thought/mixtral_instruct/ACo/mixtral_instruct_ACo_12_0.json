However, the second statement ('If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo') only tells us that *if* Joe went to the park, *then* Lucy would go to the zoo. It doesn't necessarily mean that Joe going to the park is the only condition for Lucy to go to the zoo.\n3. Therefore, based solely on these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
