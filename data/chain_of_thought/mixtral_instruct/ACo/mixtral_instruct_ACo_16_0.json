We also know that \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nFrom these two statements, can we infer that \"the shirt was cotton\"? \n\nTo answer this question, let's consider what the second statement means. It tells us that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (the pants being denim) follows. However, it doesn't tell us whether the condition is actually true or not.\n\nSince we already know that the pants are denim, this fact alone does not necessarily mean that the shirt must be cotton. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the shirt were cotton, but it doesn't require the shirt to be cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
