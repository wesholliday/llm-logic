We also have the conditional statement: \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer \"the bear was in the cave,\" we need to check if the given information satisfies the condition stated in step 2.\n4. In this case, since we already know that \"the wolf was in the den\" is true, and it's the consequent of our conditional statement, the antecedent must also be true for the implication to hold.\n5. Therefore, since the wolf is in the den, the bear must be in the cave as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
