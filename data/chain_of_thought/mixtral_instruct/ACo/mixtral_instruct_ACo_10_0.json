To use this information to infer whether 'The dog was inside', we need to see if the given condition (the dog being inside) leads to the observed result (the cat being outside).\n4. In this case, since we already know that 'The cat was outside', it means that the condition 'The dog was inside' holds true for the given statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
