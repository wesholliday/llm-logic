The second statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there.\n3. Since we already know that Sue was at the wedding, it means that someone else (in this case, possibly Mary) could have been at the wedding as well.\n4. However, just because Sue was at the wedding and the condition for Mary to be at the wedding is met, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was actually present. The given information does not explicitly confirm Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: No.",
