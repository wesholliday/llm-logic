We also know that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (premise 2).\n3. To determine if we can infer \"the cake was chocolate,\" let's use logical reasoning called \"modus ponens.\" Modus ponens states: If P \u2192 Q and P are true, then Q must be true.\n4. In our case, P represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n5. Premise 2 is in the form of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and premise 1 gives us Q.\n6. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to infer that P must be true, which means \"the cake was chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
