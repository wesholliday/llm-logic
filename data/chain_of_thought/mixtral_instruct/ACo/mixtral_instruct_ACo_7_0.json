(A -> C)\n\nStep 2: Identify what we want to infer.\nWe want to infer: Alex finishes the race. (A)\n\nStep 3: Analyze how the statements are connected.\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if its condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then its conclusion (Chris finished the race) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of its condition.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the inference can be made.\nSince we only know that Chris finished the race and there is no direct or indirect evidence regarding Alex's finishing the race, we cannot infer that Alex finishes the race based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
