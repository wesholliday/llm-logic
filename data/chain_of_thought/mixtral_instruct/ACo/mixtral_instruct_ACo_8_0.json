From these two statements, can we conclude that 'The vampire was awake'?\n4. To determine this, let's consider a truth table for the given statement:\n   - V: vampire is awake\n   - M: mummy is awake\n   - Statement 1: M\n   - Statement 2: (V -> M)\n5. Using a truth table, we see that both statements can be true if either 'V' or 'M' is true. However, they also hold true when 'V' is false and 'M' is true.\n6. Since we only know that 'M' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'V' must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: No.",
