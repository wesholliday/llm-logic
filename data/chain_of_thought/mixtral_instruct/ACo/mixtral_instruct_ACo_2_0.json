We also know that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (statement B).\n3. Statement B can be rephrased as \"If the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest.\"\n4. However, since we know from statement A that the unicorn is indeed in the forest, this does not give us any information about whether the griffin is in the forest or not.\n5. Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer that \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
