We know that there is a possibility that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n2. The statement does not claim that the sunglasses are definitely not in her bag; it only presents a possibility.\n3. To infer whether the sunglasses must be in her bag or not, we would need definitive information stating that they are indeed in her bag.\n4. Since we don't have such information and only know about a possibility, we cannot make a firm conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag because all we know is a possibility, not a certainty.",
