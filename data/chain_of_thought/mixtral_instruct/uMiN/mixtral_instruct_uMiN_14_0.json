The statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" implies that there is a possibility or uncertainty about the location of the milk.\n2. This does not rule out other possible locations for the milk, such as the refrigerator.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's absolutely necessary for the milk to not be on the counter since it could still be in its proper place inside the refrigerator or any other valid location.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.",
