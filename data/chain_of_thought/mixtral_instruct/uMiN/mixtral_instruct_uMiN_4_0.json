The use of \"might\" indicates a possibility, but it does not exclude other possibilities.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the alien is not required to have visited Mars, let's consider the given information:\n1. There is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars (the alien might not have visited Mars).\n2. However, there is no information provided that rules out the possibility of the alien visiting another planet or place instead.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that it must be the case that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.",
