When we say \"the jacket might not be draped over the chair,\" we are acknowledging the possibility that the jacket is not on the chair.\n\nNow, let's examine the statement \"it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\" This statement means that it is possible for the jacket to not be draped over the chair.\n\nGiven these meanings, we can see that both statements express a similar idea: there is a possibility that the jacket is not on the chair. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer anything contrary to this possibility.\n\nAnswer: No.",
