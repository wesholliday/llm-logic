We know that there is a possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n2. However, just because something is possible does not mean it is necessary or required to be true.\n3. In this case, the fact that the griffin might not have been in the forest doesn't rule out other possibilities where the griffin could be somewhere else.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is a requirement (i.e., must) for the griffin to be in the forest based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
