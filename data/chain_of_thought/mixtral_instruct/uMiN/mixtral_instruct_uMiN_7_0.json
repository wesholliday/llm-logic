In this case, it suggests that there is a chance that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about whether we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race. If we know that Alex might not have finished the race, then it means there is a possibility that he didn't complete the race. This implies that it cannot be definitively said that he had to finish the race since there is an alternative possibility where he did not finish.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
