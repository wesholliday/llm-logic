This does not definitively rule out the possibility that the toy could still be in the toy box, but it does mean that the toy being in the toy box is not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, given \"the toy might not be in the toy box,\" we cannot infer that \"it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\" The statement \"the toy might not be in the toy box\" does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the toy is not required or certain to be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: No.",
