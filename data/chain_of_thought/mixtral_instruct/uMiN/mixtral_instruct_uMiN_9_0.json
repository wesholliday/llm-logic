Now, when we say \"it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt,\" it means that it is possible for Lisa to not have bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, it implies that there is a possibility she didn't buy it, which aligns with \"it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" Both statements acknowledge the possibility of Lisa not purchasing the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
