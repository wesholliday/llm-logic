In our case, P represents 'Jeff played basketball' and Q represents 'Amy played tennis'.\n3. So, the first premise is (P -> Q), the second premise is not-Q, and the conclusion is not-P.\n4. This form of argument is logically valid because if the first premise (P -> Q) is true and the second premise (not-Q) is also true, then the conclusion (not-P) must be true as well.\n5. In other words, if it's true that 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', and it's true that 'Amy did not play tennis', then it necessarily follows that 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
