            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that the cat was not outside, or in logical notation, not-Q.\n3. Now we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from these two premises. To do this, let's assume for a moment that the conclusion is false, i.e., the dog was inside (P).\n4. According to our first premise, if the dog was inside (P), then the cat should have been outside (Q). However, we know from the second premise that the cat was not outside (not-Q).\n5. This creates a contradiction because in one hand we assumed that the dog was inside and thus the cat should be outside, but on the other hand, we know that the cat was not outside.\n6. Therefore, our initial assumption that the dog was inside must be incorrect, which means the dog was indeed not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid. It uses the principle of contrapositive in logic, where if \"if P, then Q\" is true, then \"if not-Q, then not-P\" is also true.",
