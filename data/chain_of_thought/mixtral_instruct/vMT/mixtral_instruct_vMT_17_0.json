In our case, P represents 'Ben ate pasta' and Q represents 'Kate ate salad'.\n3. If the first premise is true (if Ben ate pasta), and the second premise is true (Kate did not eat salad), then the conclusion must be true (Ben did not eat pasta).\n4. This is because if Kate did not eat salad, then the only way for the first premise to be true would be for Ben to have not eaten pasta.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
