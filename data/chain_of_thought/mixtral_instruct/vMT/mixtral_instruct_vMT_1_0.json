            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism or a conditional proposition.\n2. The second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding.\n3. To determine whether this argument form is logically valid, we need to consider whether it's possible for both premises to be true and yet have the conclusion be false.\n4. If Mary was indeed at the wedding (first premise is false), but Sue wasn't (second premise is true), then the conclusion 'Mary was not at the wedding' would be false.\n5. However, if both premises are true, i.e., if Mary wasn't at the wedding and Sue also wasn't at the wedding, then the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n6. Therefore, this argument form is logically valid only when both premises are true; otherwise, it can be invalid.\n\nAnswer: Yes, but only if both premises are true.",
