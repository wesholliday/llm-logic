This is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry.\n3. To determine whether the conclusion logically follows from these two premises, we can use a technique called logical transposition. Transposing the first premise gives us: if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n4. Given the second premise that the muffins were not blueberry, and applying our transposed statement, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
