The second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which is the negation of Q (not-Q).\n3. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n4. In this case, the conclusion is that Joe did not go to the park (not-P).\n5. Given the first premise and the second premise (not-Q), we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (not-P) because if he had, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo (which contradicts the second premise).\n6. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
