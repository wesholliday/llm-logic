This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical proposition or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second premise states that the banana was not yellow.\n3. To evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from these two premises, we can use a technique called logical contrapositive.\n4. The logical contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to 'If not-Q, then not-P'.\n5. Applying this rule to the first premise: If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q). Its contrapositive would be: If the banana was not yellow (not-Q), then the apple was not red (not-P).\n6. This contrapositive matches the given conclusion.\n7. Since the conclusion is the logical contrapositive of the first premise, and the second premise contradicts the antecedent of the first premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
