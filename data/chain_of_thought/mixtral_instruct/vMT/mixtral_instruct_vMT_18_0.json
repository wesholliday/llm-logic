The second premise states that the truck was not metal, or \"truck \u2260 metal\".\n3. If we assume the first premise is true and combine it with the second premise, then the truck being not metal means that the condition of the first premise cannot be met.\n4. Since the condition of the first premise cannot be met, the conclusion must be true by default, as there is no other possible outcome given the two premises.\n5. Therefore, the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
