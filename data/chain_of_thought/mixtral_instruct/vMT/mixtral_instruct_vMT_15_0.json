The second premise states that Erin did not take a train.\n3. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to see whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n4. If Erin did not take a train, then according to the first premise, Sam could not have taken a plane.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion 'Sam did not take a plane' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
