The second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (let's denote this as P2: ~M).\n3. The conclusion states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (let's denote this as C: ~L).\n4. To check if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n5. If Mark didn't buy the blue shirt (P2), then according to the first premise (P1), Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt either.\n6. Therefore, if both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
