This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the two premises.\n4. In this case, the conclusion is 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n5. Given that the second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest and the first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest, it follows that the griffin could not have been in the forest either.\n6. Therefore, the conclusion 'The griffin was not in the forest' necessarily follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
