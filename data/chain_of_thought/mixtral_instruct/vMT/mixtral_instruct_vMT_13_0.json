This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical proposition or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second premise states that the truck was not blue.\n3. To evaluate whether this form of argument is logically valid, we can use a technique called counterexample testing. A counterexample is a specific instance that contradicts the conclusion of an argument. If a counterexample can be found, then the argument is not valid; if no counterexample can be found, then the argument may be valid.\n4. To test this argument for validity using counterexamples, let's assume the opposite of the conclusion: the car was red.\n5. Given that the car is red, and according to the first premise, it follows that the truck must be blue.\n6. However, we know from the second premise that the truck was not blue. This creates a contradiction between our assumption (the car was red) and the given information (the truck was not blue).\n7. Since this contradiction exists, there is no way for both premises to be true while the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
