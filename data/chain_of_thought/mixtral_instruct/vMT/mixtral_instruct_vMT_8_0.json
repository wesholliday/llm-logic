            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This can be represented as \"Vampire awake -> Mummy awake\".\n2. The second premise states that the mummy was not awake, which can be represented as \"~Mummy awake\".\n3. The conclusion is that the vampire was not awake, which can be represented as \"~Vampire awake\".\n4. To test for logical validity, we assume the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true.\n5. If the vampire was awake (Vampire awake), then according to the first premise, the mummy would have been awake (Mummy awake). But this contradicts the second premise that states the mummy was not awake (~Mummy awake). Therefore, the assumption that the vampire is awake leads to a contradiction.\n6. Since assuming the premises are true led to a contradiction, we must conclude that the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake\" (~Vampire awake) must be true if the premises are true.\n7. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
