            "content": "Step 1: Identify the logical structure of the argument. The argument appears to follow Modus Tollens, which has the following form:\n\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: Not B\nC: Therefore, not A\n\nIn this case, \"A\" represents \"the book was written by James,\" and \"B\" represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical validity of the argument. To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, would it be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false?\n\nIn this case, if both premises are true (i.e., if the book was not written by James and is not a mystery novel), then the conclusion that the book was not written by James must also be true. It's inconceivable for the premises to hold and the conclusion to be false because the argument's structure guarantees that if the two premises are correct, the conclusion will always be accurate as well.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes",
