This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise states that Chris did not finish the race.\n3. If we assume the first premise to be true and combine it with the second premise, this would mean that since Chris didn't finish the race, Alex couldn't have finished the race either (because if Alex had finished, then Chris would have as well).\n4. Therefore, based on the given premises, we can logically conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
