In this case, P represents 'Tom watched football' and Q represents 'Jen watched basketball.'\n3. The first premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' can be rewritten as 'P implies Q.'\n4. The second premise 'Jen did not watch basketball' can be rewritten as 'Not Q.'\n5. The conclusion 'Tom did not watch football' can be rewritten as 'Not P.'\n6. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of a modus tollens, which is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
