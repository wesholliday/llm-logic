            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This is a negative statement about the robot's visit to Jupiter.\n3. The conclusion states that the alien did not visit Mars. This is also a negative statement about the alien's visit to Mars.\n4. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we can use a technique called \"contrapositive reasoning\". \n5. The contrapositive of the first premise would be 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'. This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n6. Given that the second premise matches the condition in the contrapositive, we can infer that the conclusion must be true.\n7. Therefore, if both premises are true, the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
