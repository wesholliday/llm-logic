            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism or implies that the truth of one condition depends on another condition being true (if A, then B).\n2. The second premise negates the claim made in the first premise by stating that the pants were not denim.\n3. Based on this information, we cannot conclude whether the shirt was cotton or not because there is no direct relationship established between the shirt and its material in either of the premises.\n4. The argument form is a fallacy known as denying the consequent, which occurs when someone concludes that if their initial assumption (in this case, 'If the shirt was cotton') is false, then the original statement must be false. However, there could be other reasons why the pants were not denim, unrelated to the material of the shirt.\n5. Therefore, the argument form is not logically valid because it does not follow a correct logical reasoning process.\n\nAnswer: No.",
