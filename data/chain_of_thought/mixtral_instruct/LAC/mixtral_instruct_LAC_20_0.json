            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical proposition in logic. It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) follows.\n2. We also know that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n3. However, just because the consequence of our first statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the condition was true. It could be that the condition was false and the apple wasn't red at all - this would still result in a yellow banana.\n4. Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot logically infer that 'The apple was red.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
