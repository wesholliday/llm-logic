Given statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (We can write this as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\")\n2. Given statement: Sue was at the wedding. (Sue)\n\nNow let's analyze these statements using logical reasoning:\n\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n- However, the truth of the conclusion (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily mean that the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true as well. This is because there could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding besides Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
