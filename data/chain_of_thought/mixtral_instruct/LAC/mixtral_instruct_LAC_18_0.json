            "content": " To approach this question, let's first break down the given statements:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Let's denote this as A -> B)\n2. The truck was metal. (Let's denote this as B)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can logically infer that 'The doll was plastic' (A). To do this, we need to see if the given statements support a logical relationship called Modus Ponens, which states:\n\nP -> Q\nP\n_______\nQ\n\nIn our case, P is 'The doll was plastic', and Q is 'The truck was metal'. We are given B (truck is metal), so we want to see if A can be inferred.\n\nLet's examine the given statements:\n1. If A, then B (If doll is plastic, then truck is metal)\n2. B (Truck is metal)\n\nSince there is no direct mention of 'The doll was plastic', we cannot use Modus Ponens to infer that it is true. However, the given statements do support another logical relationship called Modus Tollens:\n\nP -> Q\n~Q\n_______\n~P\n\nIn our case, ~Q is 'The truck is not metal'. Since we know B (truck is metal), this means ~Q is false, and thus, the conclusion would be ~P (doll is not plastic).\n\nSince we cannot use Modus Ponens to infer that 'The doll was plastic', and using Modus Tollens leads us to the opposite conclusion ('The doll was not plastic'), we cannot logically infer 'The doll was plastic' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
