            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic.\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P stands for \"Joe went to the park\" and Q stands for \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n2. We also know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (Q) is true.\n3. Now we want to find out if we can logically infer that \"Joe went to the park\" (P).\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if Joe didn't go to the park (~P). If Joe didn't go to the park, then according to our conditional statement, Lucy wouldn't have gone to the zoo either (~Q). However, we know that Lucy did go to the zoo (Q), so our assumption that Joe didn't go to the park (~P) must be false.\n5. Therefore, since ~P is false, P must be true. In other words, Joe did go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
