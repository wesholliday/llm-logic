We have the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical or an implication. It means that if the condition (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate eating salad) must also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"Kate ate salad\" is true.\n3. To determine if we can logically infer that \"Ben ate pasta,\" we need to see if the given information satisfies the condition of our conditional statement.\n4. In this case, the condition (Ben eating pasta) has not been explicitly stated as true or false.\n5. We only know that the consequence (Kate eating salad) is true.\n6. Since we don't have enough information to confirm whether Ben ate pasta, we cannot logically infer that he did.\n\nAnswer: No.",
