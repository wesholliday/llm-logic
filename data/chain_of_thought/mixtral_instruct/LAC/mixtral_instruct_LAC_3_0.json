            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic.\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"the book was written by James\" and Q represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n2. We also know that the book is a mystery novel (Q).\n3. Our goal is to determine if we can logically infer that the book was written by James (P).\n4. To do this, we need to consider whether the given information and the structure of the conditional statement support the logical inference of P from Q.\n5. In general, knowing that a consequence (Q) is true does not necessarily mean that its corresponding cause (P) is also true. This is because there could be other possible causes for the same consequence.\n6. In this case, since we only know that the book is a mystery novel (Q), it doesn't guarantee that James was the one who wrote it (P). There might be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n7. Therefore, based on the given information and logical principles, we cannot logically infer 'The book was written by James.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
