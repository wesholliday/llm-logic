            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement (also known as an \"if-then\" statement): \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be represented in logical notation as: (C \u2192 D), where C represents \"the shirt was cotton,\" and D represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n2. The second statement is that \"The pants were denim\" (D).\n3. We want to know if we can logically infer that \"The shirt was cotton\" (C) based on these two statements.\n4. To determine this, let's consider what would happen if the shirt were not cotton (~C). According to the contrapositive of the first statement, if the pants are denim (D), then the shirt must be cotton (C). This means that if the pants are denim (D) and the shirt is not cotton (~C), we have a contradiction.\n5. Since having both D and ~C would lead to a contradiction, it follows that the shirt must be cotton (C) based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
