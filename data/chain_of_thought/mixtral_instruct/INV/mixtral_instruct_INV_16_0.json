This does not cover all possibilities; it only tells us what happens when A is true (the shirt is cotton). It doesn't tell us anything about what happens when A is false (the shirt is not cotton).\n3. Specifically, the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility that the pants could be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
