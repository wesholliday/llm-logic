The given statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"if not q, then not p\". In other words, \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n3. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. It only tells us what happens when Sue chooses pizza (Bob chooses pasta), but it doesn't specify what happens when Sue chooses something other than pizza.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
