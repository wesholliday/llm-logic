This is called a conditional statement and it means that if the condition (p) is true, then the consequence (q) must also be true.\n2. We want to know if we can infer the converse of this statement, which would be \"if not p, then not q\". The converse switches the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement.\n3. However, just because the original statement is true, it doesn't automatically mean that its converse is also true. \n4. In this case, the original statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' does not provide enough information to conclude 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'. It could be that the book is still a mystery novel even if it wasn't written by James.\n\nAnswer: No.",
