            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statement and examine its logical structure:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It can be written in formal logic notation as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be ~Q \u2192 ~P, or in English, \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n3. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement (P \u2192 Q), meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n4. However, without knowing whether the original statement is true or false, we cannot definitively say whether its contrapositive is true or false. We can only determine logical relationships between statements based on their structure, not their truth values.\n5. In this case, since the original statement is a conditional statement and its contrapositive has the same logical structure but with negated components, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, assuming the original statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is true, we can infer that 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.' However, without knowing whether the original statement is true or false, we cannot definitively say whether its contrapositive is true or false.",
