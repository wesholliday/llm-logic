            "content": " To approach this question, let's first understand the given conditional statement:\n\nPremise: If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (S). This is represented as P -> S.\n\nNow we want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of the premise, which would be: If Kate did not eat salad (~S), then Ben did not eat pasta (~P).\n\nTo do this, let's analyze each possible scenario:\n1. Ben ate pasta and Kate ate salad (P and S): This satisfies the original statement.\n2. Ben did not eat pasta and Kate did not eat salad (~P and ~S): In this case, there is no conflict with the original statement.\n3. Ben did not eat pasta but Kate ate salad (~P and S): This scenario contradicts the original statement.\n4. Ben ate pasta but Kate did not eat salad (P and ~S): This scenario also contradicts the original statement.\n\nSince there is no scenario where Ben eats pasta and Kate does not eat salad, we cannot infer the contrapositive of the given conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot say that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: No.",
