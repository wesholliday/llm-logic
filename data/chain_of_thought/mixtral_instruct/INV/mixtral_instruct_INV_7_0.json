            "content": " To answer this question, let's first break down the given statement using logical symbols:\n\nGiven Statement: If Alex finished the race (A), then Chris finished the face (C). In logical notation, this is represented as A \u2192 C.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the following statement from the given one: If Alex didn't finish the race (\u00acA), then Chris didn't finish the race (\u00acC). In logical notation, this is represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acC.\n\nTo do this, let's analyze both statements using a truth table:\n\n| A   | C   | A \u2192 C |\n|---|---|---|\n| T   | T   | T    |\n| T   | F   | F    |\n| F   | T   | T    |\n| F   | F   | T    |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that the given statement A \u2192 C is only false when Alex finishes (A=T) but Chris doesn't (C=F). In all other cases, it holds true.\n\nNow let's examine the inferred statement \u00acA \u2192 \u00acC:\n\n| A   | C   | \u00acA  | \u00acC  | \u00acA \u2192 \u00acC |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T   | T   | F   | F   | T     |\n| T   | F   | F   | T   | T     |\n| F   | T   | T   | F   | F     |\n| F   | F   | T   | T   | T     |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that the inferred statement \u00acA \u2192 \u00acC is true in all cases except when Alex doesn't finish (\u00acA=T) but Chris does (\u00acC=F).\n\nSince there are situations where A \u2192 C holds true while \u00acA \u2192 \u00acC does not, we cannot infer that 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race' based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
