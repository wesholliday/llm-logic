            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, which can be written in formal logic as \"M -> S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"~S -> ~M\", where \"~\" denotes the negation (not) operator.\n3. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n4. However, we cannot directly infer the contrapositive just from the original statement without additional information. We need to assume that there are no other factors that could cause Sue to be at the wedding besides Mary's presence.\n5. If we make this assumption, then it would indeed follow that if Mary was not at the wedding, Sue also wouldn't be there. But remember, this inference relies on an additional assumption beyond the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot directly infer the contrapositive from the given statement without making further assumptions.",
