            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement in logic. It tells us that if one condition (the apple being red) is true, then another condition (the banana being yellow) is also true.\n2. However, the original statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the first condition is false. In other words, it doesn't address whether the banana can be any color other than yellow when the apple is not red.\n3. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. There could be other colors for the banana when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
