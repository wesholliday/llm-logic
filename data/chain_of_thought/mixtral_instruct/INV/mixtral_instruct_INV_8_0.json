            "content": " To answer this question, let's first break down the given statement:\n\nGiven: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\nThis is known as a conditional statement and can be represented as: Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and then reversing their order. So, let's find the contrapositive for our given statement:\n\nContrapositive: Not mummy awake \u2192 Not vampire awake\n\nTo determine if we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement, let's think about the logical relationship between them. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true because they are logically equivalent statements. In other words, if it's true that \"If the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake,\" then it must also be true that \"If the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake.\"\n\nTherefore, based on our reasoning, we can infer the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
