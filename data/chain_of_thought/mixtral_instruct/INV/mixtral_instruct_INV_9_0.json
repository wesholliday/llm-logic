            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if p then q\". \n2. In logic, we have something called contrapositive which states that for any conditional statement \"if p then q\", its contrapositive \"if not q then not p\" has the same truth value.\n3. So, if Lisa bought the red shirt (p) implies Mark bought the blue shirt (q), then it follows that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not q), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not p).\n4. However, we cannot directly infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the original statement because this is the contrapositive form and it assumes that Mark buying the blue shirt is a direct result of Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot directly infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statement without assuming additional information about the causality between Lisa's and Mark's actions.",
