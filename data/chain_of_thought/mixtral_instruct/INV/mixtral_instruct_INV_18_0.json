            "content": " To approach this question, let's first break down the given conditional statement:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThis statement is in the form \"if P, then Q\". In logic, we can negate conditionals as follows: not (if P, then Q) becomes \"P and not Q\" or \"P is true and Q is false.\"\n\nNow let's negate both parts of the original statement:\n- Not plastic doll: This is the opposite of 'the doll was plastic'.\n- Not metal truck: This is the opposite of 'the truck was metal'.\n\nSo, the negated conditional statement would be \"the doll is not plastic and the truck is metal.\" However, this is different from the desired inference: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nThe given statement only allows us to infer that if the doll is not plastic, we cannot definitively say whether the truck is metal or not. The original statement does not provide enough information to conclude 'if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
