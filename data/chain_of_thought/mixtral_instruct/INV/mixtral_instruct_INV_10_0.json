            "content": " Let's break down the given statement first:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form of \"if-then\". It tells us that if the condition (dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nNow let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n2. If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nThis statement is also a conditional statement but with a negated antecedent (dog not being inside). To determine if this inferred statement is valid, we need to examine whether its truth follows logically from the original statement.\n\nTo do this, let's analyze both possibilities for the dog's location:\n\na) Dog is inside: According to the given statement, if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. So, in this case, the inferred statement would hold true because the cat being outside corresponds to the cat not being inside.\n\nb) Dog is not inside: In this case, we don't have any information about the cat's location directly. However, since there are only two possibilities for the cat (inside or outside), and we know that when the dog is inside, the cat is outside, it follows logically that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must not be outside either.\n\nTherefore, based on our reasoning, we can infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
