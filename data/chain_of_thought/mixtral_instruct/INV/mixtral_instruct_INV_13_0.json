            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement in logic. It states that if the car had a certain property (being red), then the truck has another property (being blue).\n2. However, it does not specify what color the car or the truck are if the car is not red. \n3. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that if the car is not red, then the truck must be not blue. It could be the case, but it could also be that if the car is not red, the truck is still blue, or even some other color entirely.\n4. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
