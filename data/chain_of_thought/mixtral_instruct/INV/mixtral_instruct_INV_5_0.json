This does not necessarily mean that the converse \"if Q, then P\" is also true.\n3. In this case, P represents 'Jeff played basketball' and Q represents 'Amy played tennis'.\n4. The given statement only tells us about the relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff didn't play basketball, then Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nAnswer: No.",
