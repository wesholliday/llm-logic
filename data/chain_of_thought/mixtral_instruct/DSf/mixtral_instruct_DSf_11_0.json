We have two statements: A) The newspaper is either on the porch or in the driveway, and B) The newspaper is not on the porch.\n2. Our goal is to determine if we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway based on these two statements.\n3. Since statement B tells us that the newspaper is not on the porch, we know for certain that it cannot be in its first possible location mentioned in statement A.\n4. Therefore, since there are no other options provided, and we've confirmed that the newspaper is not on the porch, we can indeed infer that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
