            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n1. We have two possible locations for the notebook: on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n2. The statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" presents us with a logical disjunction (OR), which means that at least one of these statements must be true.\n3. The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" negates the first possibility, leaving us with only one remaining option.\n4. Since we know that the notebook is not on the nightstand and there are no other options provided, it follows logically that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
