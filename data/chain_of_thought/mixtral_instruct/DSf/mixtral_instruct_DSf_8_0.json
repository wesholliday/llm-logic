We have two statements: (A) \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" and (B) \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n2. Statement A provides us with two possible locations for the remote control: hiding under the couch or being on the coffee table.\n3. Statement B tells us that the first option from statement A (remote control hiding under the couch) is not true.\n4. Since we now know that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, there's only one remaining possibility from statement A: the remote control being on the coffee table.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
