            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n1. We have two statements: A) \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box\" and B) \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n2. Statement A presents us with a disjunction (OR statement), which means that at least one of its parts must be true. In this case, either the toy is on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\n3. Statement B tells us that the first part of statement A is false; hence, the toy cannot be on the shelf.\n4. Since we know that only one part of a disjunction can be true and the first part has been proven false, it follows that the second part must be true.\n5. Therefore, if the toy isn't on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
