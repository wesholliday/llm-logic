We have two statements: A) \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" and B) \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\"\n2. Statement A presents us with a disjunction (an 'or' statement), where one of the two possibilities must be true: either the scarf is on the coat rack, or it is in the backpack.\n3. Statement B negates the first possibility from statement A, telling us that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n4. Given that the first possibility (the scarf being on the coat rack) has been ruled out by statement B, we can now infer that the second possibility from statement A must be true: the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
