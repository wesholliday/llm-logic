We have two initial statements: a) \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\" and b) \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\"\n2. The second statement negates one of the possibilities from the first statement, leaving us with only one option remaining.\n3. In this case, since we know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then by process of elimination, it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
