We are told that either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside (exclusive OR). This means that only one of these statements can be true at a time.\n2. Next, we learn that Fido is not in the garden. \n3. Since Fido cannot be in both the garden and inside simultaneously due to the first statement, and now we know that Fido is not in the garden, it follows logically that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
