We have two statements: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" and \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\".\n2. The first statement presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece - either it's blending in on the floor or it's in the box.\n3. The second statement confirms that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, thus eliminating one possibility from the first statement.\n4. Since we now know that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, by process of elimination, it must be in the box (which was the other possibility presented in the first statement).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
