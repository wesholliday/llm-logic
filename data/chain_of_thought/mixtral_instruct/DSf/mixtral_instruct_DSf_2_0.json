We have two statements: A) The book is either on the table or on the shelf, and B) The book is not resting on the table.\n2. From statement B, we know that the first possibility in statement A (the book being on the table) is false.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the second possibility in statement A (the book being on the shelf) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
