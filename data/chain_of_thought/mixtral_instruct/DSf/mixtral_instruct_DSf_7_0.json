The statement 'Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car' presents us with an \"exclusive or\" situation, meaning only one of these options can be true at a time.\n3. The statement 'The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet' negates one of the possibilities from our initial list.\n4. Since we know that the umbrella is not in the closet, and based on the original \"exclusive or\" statement, it must follow that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
