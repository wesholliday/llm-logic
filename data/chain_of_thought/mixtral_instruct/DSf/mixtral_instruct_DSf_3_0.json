            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We have two statements: \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" and \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\".\n2. The first statement presents us with two possibilities for the location of the keys: either the cabinet or the drawer.\n3. The second statement confirms that the keys are not found at one of those locations (the cabinet).\n4. Since we only have these two options and one has been ruled out, it follows logically that the remaining option must be true.\n5. Therefore, if the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
