We have two possible locations for the cookies: the pantry or the jar (let's call this statement A).\n2. The second statement tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (let's call this statement B).\n3. Now, we want to find out if we can conclude that the cookies must be in the jar based on statements A and B.\n4. To do this, let's examine each possibility:\n   a. If the cookies were hidden in the pantry, then according to statement B, they cannot be there.\n   b. Therefore, by process of elimination, if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar (which is what we wanted to prove).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
