We have two possible states for the watch: it is either on his wrist or charging on the dresser.\n2. We are told that the watch is not on his wrist.\n3. Based on this information, we can infer that there's only one remaining option for the watch's location.\n4. Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
