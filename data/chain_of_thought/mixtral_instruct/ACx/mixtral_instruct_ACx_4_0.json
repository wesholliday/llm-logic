We have two statements: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" and \"The fribble crinked.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if some condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then another statement follows (the fribble crinked).\n3. The second statement tells us that the fribble did indeed crinkle.\n4. However, just because the fribble crinked doesn't necessarily mean it was snurgled. There could be other reasons for the fribble to crinkle.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
