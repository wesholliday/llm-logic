The grommet plopped the frink. (Statement B)\n\nNow, let's analyze whether Statement B implies Statement A using logical reasoning:\n\n- Statement B tells us that the grommet plopped the frink. However, it does not necessarily mean that the grommet was sploffed before plopping the frink.\n- The given conditional statement (A) has a specific condition: \"If the grommet was sploffed.\" This implies that there might be other reasons for the grommet to plop the frink, not just being sploffed.\n- Therefore, based on Statement B alone, we cannot infer that 'The grommet was sploffed.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
