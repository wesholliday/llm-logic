We have two statements: \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\".\n2. The second statement tells us that it is not necessary for the cookies to be in the pantry, which means they could still potentially be in the pantry, but they don't have to be.\n3. However, since the first statement only gives us two options (pantry or jar), and the second statement rules out one of those options (pantry), then by process of elimination, the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
