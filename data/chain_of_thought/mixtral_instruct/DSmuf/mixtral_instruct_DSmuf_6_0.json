We have two statements: (A) \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room\" and (B) \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n2. Statement A can be rephrased as \"Exactly one of these two statements is true: (1) The phone is ringing in the kitchen, or (2) The phone is in the living room.\"\n3. Statement B tells us that option 1 from statement A is not true, which means the phone cannot be ringing in the kitchen.\n4. Since we know that only one of the two options in statement A is true and option 1 has been proven false, it follows that option 2 must be true.\n5. Therefore, the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
