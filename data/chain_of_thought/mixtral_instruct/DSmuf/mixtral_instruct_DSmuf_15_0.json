We have two options for where the shoes can be: either they are lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\n2. It is stated that it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door, which means there is no obligation for the shoes to be placed there.\n3. Since we only have two options and one of them has been ruled out (the shoes being lined up by the door), we can infer that the remaining option is true.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The shoes are in the closet.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
