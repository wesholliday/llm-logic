We have two statements: \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" and \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\".\n2. The second statement means that there is no necessity for the missing sock to be under the bed, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the sock being under the bed.\n3. However, since the first statement presents only two possible locations for the missing sock (under the bed or in the laundry basket), and we know from the second statement that the sock is not necessarily under the bed, then by process of elimination, the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
