This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the toy: either on the bookshelf or in the toy box.\n2. It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This statement negates the first possibility mentioned earlier, meaning that the toy cannot be on the bookshelf.\n\nNow let's think about what we can infer from this information:\n- Since the toy cannot be on the bookshelf, and there are no other options given for its location, it must be in the only remaining place mentioned - the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
