We have the statement \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement given is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This negates the first part of the original statement.\n3. Since we know that at least one part of the original disjunction must be true, and the first part has been negated, it follows that the second part must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
