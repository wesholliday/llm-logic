We have two statements: \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\".\n2. The second statement means that the cat cannot only be playing in the bedroom, but it doesn't exclude other possibilities like the cat napping on the couch or being somewhere else entirely.\n3. Now let's consider the first statement again: \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\". Since we know from the second statement that the cat cannot only be playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
