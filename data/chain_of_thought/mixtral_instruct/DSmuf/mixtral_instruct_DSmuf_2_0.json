We have two statements: \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\".\n2. The second statement tells us that it is not necessary for the book to be on the table, which means the book could still be on the table but it's not required to be there.\n3. However, since we only have two options - the table or the shelf - and the first option has been ruled out as unnecessary, then by process of elimination, the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
