We are given the statement \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This creates two possibilities for the location of the scarf.\n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\" This eliminates one of the possibilities from our initial statement.\n3. Since the first possibility (the scarf being draped on the coat rack) has been eliminated, only the second possibility remains: the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and reasoning, we can infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
