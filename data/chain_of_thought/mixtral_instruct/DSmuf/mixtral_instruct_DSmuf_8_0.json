We have two statements: (A) \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" and (B) \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\".\n2. Statement A gives us two possibilities for the location of the remote control: hiding under the couch or on the coffee table.\n3. Statement B negates the possibility that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This does not mean that the remote control cannot be under the couch, but rather it cannot be a certainty that the remote control is there.\n4. Since statement B eliminates the possibility of the remote control being certainly under the couch, and since statement A states that if the remote control is not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
