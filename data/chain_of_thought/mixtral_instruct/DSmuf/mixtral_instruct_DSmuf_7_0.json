We have the statement \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This presents us with two possibilities for the location of the umbrella.\n2. The second statement given is \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\" This negates the first possibility from our initial statement, leaving us only with the option that the umbrella is in the car.\n3. Therefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can infer 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
