We have the statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" This means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n2. Then we have the statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This is an 'exclusive or' statement, meaning only one of these conditions can be true at any given time.\n3. Based on the first statement, it's possible that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n4. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then according to the second statement, they must be in her bag.\n5. Therefore, from these two statements together, we can infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
