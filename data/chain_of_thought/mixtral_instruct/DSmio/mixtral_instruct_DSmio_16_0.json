We know that the statement 'The pen might not be on my desk' does not confirm whether the pen is on the desk or not; it only tells us that there is a possibility that the pen is not there.\n2. The second statement, 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk', presents two possibilities: either the pen is in the bag or it is on the desk.\n3. Since we cannot confirm that the pen is on the desk due to the first statement, we are left with the possibility that the pen is in the bag.\n4. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
