This means that the notebook could potentially be somewhere else other than the nightstand.\n2. Then we are told that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. \n3. Since we already know that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, this implies that it's possible for the notebook to be in the drawer.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
