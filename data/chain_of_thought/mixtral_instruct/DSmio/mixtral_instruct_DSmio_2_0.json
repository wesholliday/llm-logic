            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements here: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" and \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\".\n2. The first statement tells us that it's possible for the book to not be on the table, but it doesn't rule out other locations like the shelf.\n3. The second statement gives us two options: either the book is on the shelf or it's resting on the table.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the book might not be on the table, this means that the only remaining option from the second statement is that the book is on the shelf.\n5. Therefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
