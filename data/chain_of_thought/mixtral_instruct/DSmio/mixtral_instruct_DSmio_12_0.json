This means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in its usual place, i.e., the closet.\n2. The second statement tells us that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the jacket.\n3. Given that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, and considering the second statement, we can infer that the jacket must be in the other possible location mentioned - draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
