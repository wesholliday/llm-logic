We have the statement \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that there is a possibility that the cat is not in the bedroom playing.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" This is an 'exclusive or' statement, meaning one of these two options must be true and they cannot both be true at the same time.\n3. From the first statement, we know that there is a possibility that the cat is not in the bedroom playing.\n4. If the cat is not in the bedroom playing, then according to the second statement, the only other option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n5. Therefore, based on these two statements together, if the cat is indeed not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The cat is napping on the couch' if both statements are true and the cat is not playing in the bedroom.",
