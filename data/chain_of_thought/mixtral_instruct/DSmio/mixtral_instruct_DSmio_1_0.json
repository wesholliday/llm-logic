This means that it's possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it doesn't definitively say where Fido is or isn't.\n2. The second statement is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'. This is a disjunction, meaning one of the two parts must be true. \n3. However, neither of these statements contradict each other. It's possible that Fido is not in the garden (as stated in the first statement), and it's also possible that Fido is inside (as stated in the second statement).\n4. Therefore, having 'Fido might not be in the garden' does not allow us to infer 'Fido is inside'. \n\nAnswer: No.",
