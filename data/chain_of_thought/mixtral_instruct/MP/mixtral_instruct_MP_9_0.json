            "content": " To approach this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is that Lisa actually did buy the red shirt (P).\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt (Q) based on these two statements.\n4. Given that P is true and P -> Q is also true, we can indeed conclude that Q is true according to Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic.\n5. Modus Ponens states that if P is true and P -> Q is true, then Q must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
