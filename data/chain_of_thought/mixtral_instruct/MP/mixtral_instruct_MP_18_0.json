            "content": " To approach this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the doll was plastic' and Q represents 'the truck was metal.'\n2. The second statement is that 'the doll was plastic,' which is represented as P.\n3. Now we want to know if we can infer 'the truck was metal' (Q) based on these two statements.\n4. To make this inference, we need to apply Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic that states: If P -> Q is true and P is true, then Q must be true.\n5. In our case, P -> Q represents 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,' and P represents 'the doll was plastic.' Since both P -> Q and P are true, we can apply Modus Ponens to infer that Q, or 'the truck was metal,' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
