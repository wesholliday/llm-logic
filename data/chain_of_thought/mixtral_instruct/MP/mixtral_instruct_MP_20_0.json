            "content": " To approach this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement (also known as an \"if-then\" statement): If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the apple was red' and Q represents 'the banana was yellow'.\n2. The second statement is that the apple was red (P).\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow (Q) based on these two statements.\n4. According to Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic, from P -> Q and P, we can indeed infer Q.\n5. Therefore, given 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The apple was red', we can infer 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
