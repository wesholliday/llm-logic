            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement (also known as an \"if-then\" statement): If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'Tom watched football' and Q represents 'Jen watched basketball'.\n2. The second statement is that Tom did indeed watch football: P.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer that Jen watched basketball (Q) based on the given statements.\n4. To make this inference, we need to apply Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus Ponens states that from P -> Q and P, we can infer Q.\n5. In our case, P -> Q represents 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', P is 'Tom watched football', and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'.\n6. Since the given statements match the premises of Modus Ponens, we can indeed make the inference that Jen watched basketball (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
