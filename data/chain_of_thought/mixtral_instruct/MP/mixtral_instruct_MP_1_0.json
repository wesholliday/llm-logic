Given statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (We can write this as P -> Q, where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".)\n2. Also given: Mary was at the wedding (P is true).\n3. We want to find out if we can infer that Sue was at the wedding (Q is true).\n4. To do this, let's use Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic which states that from P -> Q and P, we can deduce Q.\n5. In our case, since we know that Mary was at the wedding (P is true) and the given statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (P -> Q), we can indeed infer that Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
