The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the car was red', and Q represents 'the truck was blue'.\n2. The second statement is 'The car was red' or simply P.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer that 'The truck was blue' or Q based on the given statements.\n4. Given that P is true, and P -> Q is also true, then according to the principle of Modus Ponens in logic, we can indeed infer that Q (the truck was blue) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
