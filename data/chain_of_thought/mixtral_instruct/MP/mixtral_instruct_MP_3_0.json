            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have been given two statements:\n   - Statement A: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This statement represents a conditional relationship between two propositions \u2013 that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n   - Statement B: \"The book was written by James.\"\n\n2. Our goal is to determine whether we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' based on these two statements.\n\n3. To do this, let's use Modus Ponens, a valid form of logical reasoning that states:\n   - If P -> Q (if P, then Q), and\n   - P (P is true)\n   Then we can infer Q (Q is true).\n\n4. In our case, P represents \"The book was written by James,\" and Q represents \"The book is a mystery novel.\" So, the given statement A matches the form P -> Q. And Statement B provides us with P being true.\n\n5. Therefore, using Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer that 'The book is a mystery novel' based on the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
