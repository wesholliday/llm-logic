Now let's consider the inferred statement:\n\nInferred statement: \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"\n\nThis statement is expressing a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed, which aligns with the interpretation of the given statement. Since there are possible scenarios where the flugel was not blimmed (as per the given statement), it is reasonable to infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
