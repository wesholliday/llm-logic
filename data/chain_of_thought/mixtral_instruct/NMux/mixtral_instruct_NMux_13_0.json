It asserts that it is not required or compulsory for the glip to be slogged.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inferred statement: \"The glip might not have been slogged.\" This statement expresses a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first one, let's analyze their logical relationship. The given statement denies the necessity of the glip being slogged, which implies that there is no obligation or requirement for it to happen. This opens up the possibility for the glip not being slogged since there is no compulsion for it to be slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we can infer 'The glip might not have been slogged' from 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
