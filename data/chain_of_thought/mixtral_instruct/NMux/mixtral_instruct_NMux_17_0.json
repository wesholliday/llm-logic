In other words, it's saying that it's possible for the flob to exist or occur without being skizzled.\n\nInferred statement: \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\"\n\nThis statement is expressing the possibility of the flob not being skizzled.\n\nNow let's analyze if the inferred statement follows logically from the given statement.\n\nBy denying that the flob must have been skizzled, the speaker is acknowledging the possibility of the flob not being skizzled. This implies that there are scenarios where the flob can exist or occur without being skizzled. Therefore, the inferred statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" does follow logically from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
