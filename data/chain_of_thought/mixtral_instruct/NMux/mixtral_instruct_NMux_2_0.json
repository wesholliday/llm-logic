The original statement is \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped.\"\n2. This statement can be interpreted as a negation of the necessity of the event 'the wug being flooped'.\n3. When we say that something is not necessary, it implies that there is a possibility for that thing to not occur.\n4. Therefore, if the wug's flooping is not necessary, then there is a chance that the wug was not flooped.\n5. This leads us to the statement \"The wug might not have been flooped.\"\n\nNow that we have thought through the reasoning, let's provide the answer:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
