The original statement is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\"\n2. This can be rephrased as \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" or \"It is possible that the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n3. Both statements convey the same idea: there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked.\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'The whiffle might not have been shanked' from 'It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
