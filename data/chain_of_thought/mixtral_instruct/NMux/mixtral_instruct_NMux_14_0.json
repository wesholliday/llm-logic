In other words, it's saying that it's possible for the clug to NOT be fleeked.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inferred statement: \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\" This statement is expressing a possibility that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nSince both statements are expressing the same idea (that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked), we can infer the proposed statement from the given one.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
