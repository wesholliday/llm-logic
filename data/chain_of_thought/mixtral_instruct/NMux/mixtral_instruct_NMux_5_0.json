The original statement is \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled.\"\n2. This statement can be rephrased as \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" or \"It is possible that the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n3. Both statements express a sense of uncertainty about whether the zinger was fraggled or not.\n4. In this context, the negation in the original statement (\"not the case\") implies that there is some possibility for the opposite scenario (the zinger not being fraggled).\n5. Therefore, the given statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" can be inferred to mean \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
