In other words, it's saying that it's possible for the dreb to NOT be vroombed. \n\nNow let's consider the inferred statement: \"The dreb might not have been vroombed.\"\n\nThis statement is expressing a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed. Since the given statement already implies this possibility, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
