The original statement is \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged.\"\n2. This statement negates the necessity of the wug being sproinged. In other words, it asserts that it is possible for the wug to exist or occur without being sproinged.\n3. Now, let's consider the proposed inferred statement: \"The wug might not have been sproinged.\"\n4. This statement expresses a possibility \u2013 that the wug may not have undergone the action of being sproinged.\n5. Given the original statement, which denies the necessity of the wug being sproinged, it is reasonable to infer that there is a possibility for the wug to not be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
