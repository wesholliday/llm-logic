In other words, it states that it is not required or compulsory for the sneg to be crampled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The sneg might not have been crampled.\" This statement expresses possibility \u2013 that there is a chance or likelihood that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first one, let's think about what each statement implies:\n1. The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the sneg to be crampled, which means there are possible scenarios where the sneg is not crampled.\n2. Based on this information, we can indeed infer that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled, as suggested by the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
