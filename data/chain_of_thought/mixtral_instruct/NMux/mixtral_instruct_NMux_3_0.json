Given statement: \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\"\n2. This statement is logically equivalent to saying, \"The splat might not have been morphed,\" because both statements convey the same idea \u2013 there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n3. The first statement uses a double negative (it's not the case that... must not have been), which can sometimes make it more challenging to recognize its logical meaning. However, when we simplify the statement by removing the double negatives, we arrive at the second statement.\n4. Therefore, both statements convey the same idea and are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
