In other words, it suggests that the twonk might not necessarily be plinked.\n\nInferred statement: \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\"\n\nNow let's analyze if this inferred statement follows logically from the given statement. The inferred statement is expressing a possibility that the twonk was not plinked, which aligns with the original statement's implication that the twonk's plinking is not a certain event.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer 'The twonk might not have been plinked' from 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked'.",
