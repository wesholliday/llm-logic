            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel.'\n2. Next, we are told that 'the book is a mystery novel,' which corresponds to statement Q in our conditional statement.\n3. To determine if we can deduce 'The book was written by James,' we need to check if the given information supports P (the antecedent) or Q (the consequent). In this case, we are given Q and want to find out if that implies P.\n4. However, just because the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Therefore, having only the conditional statement and knowing that 'the book is a mystery novel' is not enough to deduce 'The book was written by James.'\n5. Answer: No.",
