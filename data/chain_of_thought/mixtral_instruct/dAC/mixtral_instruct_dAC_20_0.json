We also know that the banana was yellow (let's call this statement B).\n3. However, just because the banana being yellow follows from the apple being red, it doesn't mean that the apple being red is the only way for the banana to be yellow. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that B is true, we cannot definitively conclude that A is true based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
