The truck was metal. (Let's denote this as B)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can deduce that 'The doll was plastic' based on these statements. To do so, let's consider the following:\n- Statement A -> B is a conditional statement, which means that *if* A is true, then B must be true as well.\n- However, it does not mean that if B is true, then A must also be true. This type of reasoning falls under the fallacy known as 'affirming the consequent'.\n\nIn this case, since we only know that the truck was metal (B), but have no information about the material of the doll (A), we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
