We have the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is also known as a material implication, where the truth of the entire statement depends on both its antecedent (Sam took a plane) and consequent (Erin took a train).\n2. Next, we are given that \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n3. To determine if \"Sam took a plane\" is true, we need to examine the conditional statement's truth table:\n   - If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (true).\n   - In this case, since the antecedent (Sam took a plane) and consequent (Erin took a train) are both true, the entire conditional statement is true.\n4. Since the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true when both its antecedent and consequent are true, we can indeed deduce that \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
