            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is also known as a material implication, which can be symbolized as P \u2192 Q (where P represents 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q represents 'Sue was at the wedding').\n2. We are also told that 'Sue was at the wedding' (Q).\n3. Now we want to determine if we can deduce 'Mary was at the wedding' (P) based on this information.\n4. In order to establish P, we would need either a direct statement or an argument leading to its truth. However, no such information is provided in the given statements.\n5. Instead, what we have is only one half of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), which tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was too. But it does not guarantee that Mary was indeed present.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude 'Mary was at the wedding.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
