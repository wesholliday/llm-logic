The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be represented as: Sue(pizza) -> Bob(pasta).\n2. The second statement is that Bob indeed chose pasta: Bob(pasta).\n3. To determine if Sue chose pizza, we need to check if the given information satisfies the condition in the first statement.\n4. In this case, since Bob did choose pasta (as stated in the second statement), the condition for Sue choosing pizza is met.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
