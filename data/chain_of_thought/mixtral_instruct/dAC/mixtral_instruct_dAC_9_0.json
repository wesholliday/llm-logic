            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and use logical reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as p -> q, where p represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is that \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is represented as q.\n3. We want to find out if we can deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt (p) based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, let's consider what the first statement tells us about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt (p) and Mark buying the blue shirt (q). It says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n5. Now we know that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt (q), so we need to determine whether this means Lisa must have bought the red shirt (p).\n6. However, there is no information given that guarantees that Lisa's buying the red shirt is the only way for Mark to buy the blue shirt. It could be possible that Mark would buy the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa buys the red shirt or not.\n7. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt (p).\n\nAnswer: No.",
