The second premise introduces doubt about the second option, suggesting that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n3. Based on this information, we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser because there is a possibility that the watch is neither on his wrist nor charging on the dresser (e.g., it could be elsewhere).\n4. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
