This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true.\n2. The second premise suggests that we cannot rule out the possibility that the sock is not under the bed. \n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sock is in the laundry basket. It could also be elsewhere. \n4. Therefore, even though the conclusion follows from the first premise (if the sock is neither under the bed nor in the laundry basket, then the argument would be invalid), it does not follow logically from both premises together. \n\nAnswer: No.",
