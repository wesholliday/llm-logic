The second premise introduces uncertainty about Fido's presence in the garden.\n3. However, this uncertainty does not affect the validity of the first premise. It still holds that Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n4. Since there is no information suggesting that Fido cannot be inside, and given the absence of any other location mentioned, it seems reasonable to conclude that Fido is indeed inside.\n5. Therefore, the argument's form can be considered valid because if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
