This means that there is no overlap between these two possibilities; if one is true, the other cannot be.\n2. The second premise introduces uncertainty about the second option by stating that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Based on this information, we can infer that since there are only two possible locations for the keys and one of them has been cast into doubt, the remaining possibility (that the keys are in the drawer) must be true.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
