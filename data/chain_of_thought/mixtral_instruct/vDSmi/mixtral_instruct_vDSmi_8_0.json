This can be represented as P or Q.\n2. The second premise states that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, which means it could still be on the coffee table. This can be represented as not Q.\n3. The conclusion then states that the remote control is on the coffee table, which is represented as P.\n\nThe argument follows this structure:\nP or Q\nnot Q\ntherefore P\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because if the first premise is true and the second premise denies one of the possibilities in the first premise, then the remaining possibility must be true. In this case, if the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch, and it's not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
