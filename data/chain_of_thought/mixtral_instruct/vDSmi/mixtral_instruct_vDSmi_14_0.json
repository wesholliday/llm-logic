The second premise suggests that there is a possibility that the milk might not be in the fridge.\n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the milk must be on the counter. It could also be somewhere else entirely.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'The milk is on the counter' does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
