This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true.\n2. The second premise introduces some uncertainty about the second option - the notebook might not be on the nightstand. \n3. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the first option (the notebook being in the drawer) is true. It could also be that we haven't checked other possible locations.\n4. Therefore, even though the conclusion follows from the information given, it doesn't necessarily follow logically because there could be other possibilities not considered in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
