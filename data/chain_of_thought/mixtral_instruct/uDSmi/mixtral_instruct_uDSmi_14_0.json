This is a statement of logical exhaustion, meaning there are no other possibilities.\n2. However, we also know that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. This doesn't necessarily mean it's on the counter; it could be anywhere else as well (like in the freezer or spilled on the floor).\n3. Without more information, we cannot definitively say where the milk is. It could be on the counter, but it could also be somewhere else.\n\nAnswer: No.",
