We are also told that the notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer. The second statement tells us only about the possibility of the notebook not being on the nightstand, but it doesn't provide any information about where the notebook could be if it isn't there. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot make a certain inference about the location of the notebook.\n\nAnswer: No.",
