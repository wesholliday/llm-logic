However, we also know that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. \n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table. The remote control could still be in another location besides the coffee table or the couch. For example, it could be in a drawer, with someone else, or anywhere else. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot make a certain inference about the location of the remote control.\n\nAnswer: No.",
