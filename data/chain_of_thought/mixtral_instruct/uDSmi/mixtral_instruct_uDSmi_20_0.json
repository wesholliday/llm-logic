We also know that it's possible that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag because there is still a possibility that they could be somewhere else or even lost. The given information only allows us to know that the sunglasses are either in her bag or not perched on her head, but it doesn't confirm their location with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No.",
