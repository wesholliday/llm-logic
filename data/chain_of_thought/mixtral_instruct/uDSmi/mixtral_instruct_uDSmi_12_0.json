This is a statement of exhaustive possibilities, meaning one of these two things must be true.\n2. However, we are also told that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. The word \"might\" here introduces uncertainty - it doesn't rule out the possibility that the jacket could still be hanging in the closet.\n3.
