This means there are only two possible locations for Fido - inside or in the garden.\n2. We also know that it's possible that Fido might not be in the garden. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Fido is inside because we still have one location (inside) unaccounted for.\n3. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" could mean that Fido could be somewhere else entirely, not just inside.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the given information.",
