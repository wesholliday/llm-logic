We know that \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" means that it is possible for the cat to not be playing in the bedroom, but it doesn't necessarily mean the cat isn't there or that it's napping on the couch.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch,\" presents two possibilities: a) the cat is playing in the bedroom, or b) the cat is napping on the couch.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the cat not to be playing in the bedroom, this implies that the second possibility (b) must be true, i.e., the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
