This means that there is no requirement or necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head.\n2. Then we are given the statement 'Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag'. Since we've established that it's not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head, we can eliminate the first part of this disjunction (the 'or').\n3. This leaves us with only one option: the sunglasses are in her bag.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
