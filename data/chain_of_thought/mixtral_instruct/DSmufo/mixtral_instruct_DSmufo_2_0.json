We have the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that it is possible for the book to not be on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the book is definitely not on the table.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the book to not be on the table, then by process of elimination, the book must be on the shelf.\n3. However, keep in mind that these statements only allow us to infer that the book is on the shelf based on the given information; they do not guarantee this fact absolutely. There could still be other possibilities outside the scope of these two statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
