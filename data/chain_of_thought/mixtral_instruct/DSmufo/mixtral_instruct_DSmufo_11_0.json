We know that \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\" which means that it is possible for the newspaper to not be on the porch.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\". Since we already know from point 1 that the newspaper does not have to be on the porch, this leaves us with only one option: the newspaper being in the driveway.\n3. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer that 'The newspaper is in the driveway'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
