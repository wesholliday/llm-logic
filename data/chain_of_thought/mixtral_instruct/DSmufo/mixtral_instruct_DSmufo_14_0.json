We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n2. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" means that there is no requirement for the milk to be in the fridge; it could be somewhere else.\n3. The second statement, \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter,\" presents us with two possibilities: either the milk is in the fridge (which we now know isn't required), or it is on the counter.\n4. Since there is no obligation for the milk to be in the fridge, and since the only other option given is that the milk is on the counter, we can infer that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
