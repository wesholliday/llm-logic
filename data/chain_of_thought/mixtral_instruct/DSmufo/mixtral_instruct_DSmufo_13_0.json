We know that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" which means that it is possible for the toy to not be on the bookshelf.\n2. Then we are given the statement \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box\". This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements must be true.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the toy to not be on the bookshelf, the other part of the disjunction must be true, i.e., \"the toy is in the toy box\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
