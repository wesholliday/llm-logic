We know that \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" which means that it is possible for the umbrella to not be in the closet.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\". This is a statement in the form of \"either P or Q\", where P represents \"the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" and Q represents \"it is in the car\".\n3. Since we know from point 1 that it's possible for the umbrella to not be in the closet, then P cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, since the statement \"Either P or Q\" must be true, and P is false, it means that Q must be true.\n5. So yes, we can infer 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
