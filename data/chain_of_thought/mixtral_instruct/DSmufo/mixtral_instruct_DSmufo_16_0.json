We know that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" which means that it is possible for the pen to not be on the desk.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\". Since we already know that it's possible for the pen to not be on the desk, this statement implies that the pen must be in the bag.\n3. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
