It doesn't necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden, just that he doesn't have to be there.\n2. \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\" presents two possibilities: either Fido has to be in the garden, or he is inside.\n3. From the first statement, we know that Fido doesn't have to be in the garden. \n4. Therefore, based on the second statement, since Fido doesn't have to be in the garden, it must be the case that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
