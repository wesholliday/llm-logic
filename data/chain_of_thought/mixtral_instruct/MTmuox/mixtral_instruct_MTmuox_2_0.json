We know that \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint\" which means that it is possible that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n2. Then we are given \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\". This is a conditional statement where if the condition (the wug being flooped) is true, then the consequence (the wug bimming the zoint) must also be true.\n3. However, since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the wug not to have bimmed the zoint, this implies that the condition in the second statement cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that 'The wug was not flooped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
