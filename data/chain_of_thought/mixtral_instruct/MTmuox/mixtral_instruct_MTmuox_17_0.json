We also know that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved (let's call this statement B).\n3. From these two statements, we want to determine whether the flob was not skizzled (let's call this statement C).\n4. If statement B were true, then if the flob was skizzled, it would have moved. However, since statement A tells us that it's not the case that the flob must have moved, we can infer that the flob cannot be both skizzled and moving.\n5. Therefore, if the flob was skizzled (statement C), then it would contradict our knowledge that the flob did not move (statement A).\n6. Since there is no contradiction in assuming that the flob was not skizzled (statement C is false), we can conclude that this is indeed the case.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The flob was not skizzled'.",
