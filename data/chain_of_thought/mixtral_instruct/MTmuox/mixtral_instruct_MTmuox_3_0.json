We know that \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" means that it is possible for the splat to exist without quanking. In other words, the splat's existence does not necessarily imply that it quanked.\n2. The second statement says, \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This implies that if the splat underwent morphing, then we can be sure that it quanked.\n3. However, since we know from the first statement that the splat's existence does not necessarily imply that it quanked, it is possible for the splat to exist without quanking.\n4. Therefore, if the splat can exist without quanking, then it is possible for the splat to be un-morphed (i.e., in its original state).\n5. Since we cannot rule out the possibility that the splat did not undergo morphing based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
