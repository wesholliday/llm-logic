We know that \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\" This means that it is possible for the flugel to not be zargled.\n2. We also know that \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it would definitely be zargled.\n3. However, we already established that it is possible for the flugel to not be zargled.\n4. Therefore, since the flugel can be in a state where it's not zargled, and being blimmed leads to zargling, it follows that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
