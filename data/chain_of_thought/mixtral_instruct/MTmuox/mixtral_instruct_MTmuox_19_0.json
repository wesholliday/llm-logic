We know that \"it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\" which means that it is possible for the smonk to not have plagged.\n2. We also know that \"if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\". This is a conditional statement where if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged.\n3. However, we already established that it's possible for the smonk to not have plagged. Therefore, it cannot be true that the smonk was vreebled and did not plag (because if it were vreebled, it would have had to plag).\n4. So, based on this information, we can infer that \"the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
