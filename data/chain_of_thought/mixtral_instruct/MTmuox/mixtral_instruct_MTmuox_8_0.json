            "content": "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" which means that it is possible for the sprocket to not be daggled.\n2. We also know that \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\". This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the 'if' part) is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and the consequent (the 'then' part) is \"the sprocket must have been daggled\".\n3. From these two pieces of information, we want to infer whether or not the sprocket was cranked.\n4. Since it's possible for the sprocket to not be daggled (from point 1), this implies that the sprocket might not have been cranked because if it were cranked, then it should have been daggled (from point 2).\n5. Therefore, based on our reasoning, we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
