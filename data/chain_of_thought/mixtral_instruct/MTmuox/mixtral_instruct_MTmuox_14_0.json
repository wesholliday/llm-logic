We know that \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\" means that it is possible for the clug to exist without being snugged.\n2. Then we are given \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\". This means that if the clug has been fleeked, then it must also have been snugged at some point.\n3. Now, let's consider whether we can infer 'The clug was not fleeked'. If the clug being fleeked implies that it must have been snugged and it is possible for the clug to exist without being snugged, then there is a possibility where the clug exists but wasn't fleeked.\n4. However, we cannot definitively conclude 'The clug was not fleeked', because the given information does not exclude the possibility that the clug could have been both fleeked and snugged at different times.\n\nAnswer: No.",
