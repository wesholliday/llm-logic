We know that \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed\" which means that it is possible for the flug to not be zimmed.\n2. Then we are given \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\". This is a conditional statement where the condition (flug being blummed) leads to a consequence (flug must have been zimmed).\n3. However, since we already know from point 1 that it's possible for the flug to not be zimmed, this contradicts the consequence in point 2.\n4. Therefore, if the consequence is false, then the condition cannot be true.\n5. So, based on these premises, we can indeed infer 'The flug was not blummed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
