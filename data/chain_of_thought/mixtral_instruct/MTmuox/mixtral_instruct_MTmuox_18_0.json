We know that \"it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\" means that it is possible for the shank to not be nugged.\n2. We also know that \"if the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\" means that if the shank was plooked, then it would necessarily be nugged.\n3. However, just because the shank can be nugged without being plooked (as stated in point 1), we cannot conclude that the shank was not plooked. It's possible for the shank to be both plooked and nugged, or plooked and not nugged.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The shank was not plooked'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
