We know that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned\" which means that it is possible for the fleeg to not be surned.\n2. Then we are given \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\". This is a conditional statement where the condition (fleeg being bluttered) leads to a consequence (fleeg being surned).\n3. However, from our first point, we know that it's possible for the fleeg to not be surned. \n4. Therefore, if the fleeg can be not surned even when it is bluttered, then the condition \"If the fleeg was bluttered\" cannot be inferred to lead to the consequence \"then it must have been surned\".\n5. Thus, based on this information, we cannot conclude that 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
