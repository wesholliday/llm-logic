We also know that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. \n3. Now we need to determine whether we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled based on this information.\n4. To do this, let's consider a scenario where the fribble was snurgled. According to our second piece of information, if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n5. However, we know from our first piece of information that the fribble might not have crinked at all. This creates a contradiction because if the fribble was snurgled, it should have crinked, but we're told that it might not have crinked.\n6. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
