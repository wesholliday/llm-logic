This means that there is no necessity for the sneg to have sprouted the frink.\n2. We also know that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sprotet the frink (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B, we can infer that if the sneg was crampled, then it is not the case that the sneg must not have sprouted the frink (because if it was crampled, it had to sprout the frink).\n4. However, statement A tells us exactly the opposite: that it's not the case that the sneg must have sprotet the frink.\n5. Therefore, the only way for both statements A and B to be true is if the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
