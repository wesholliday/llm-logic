We have two possible locations for the notebook: the drawer or the nightstand (exclusive options).\n2. The statement 'The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand' implies that it cannot be found at that location.\n3. Since there are no other mentioned possibilities, and we know it's not on the nightstand, it must be in the only remaining option - the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
