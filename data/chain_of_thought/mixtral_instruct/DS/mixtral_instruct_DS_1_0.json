We are told that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden (but not both). This statement can be represented as a disjunction: P \u2228 Q, where P represents 'Fido is inside', and Q represents 'Fido is in the garden'.\n2. Next, we learn that Fido is not in the garden (~Q).\n3. Now, let's analyze what we know using logical rules. Since we have a disjunction (P \u2228 Q), if one of its parts (Q) is false, then the entire statement is equivalent to the other part being true (P).\n4. Therefore, since Fido is not in the garden (~Q), it follows that Fido must be inside (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
