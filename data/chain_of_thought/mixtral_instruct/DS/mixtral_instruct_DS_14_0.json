We have two possible locations for the milk: on the counter or in the fridge (chilling).\n2. The second statement tells us that the milk is not in the fridge.\n3. Since there are only two options, and one of them has been ruled out, we can infer that the remaining option must be true.\n4. Therefore, if the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
