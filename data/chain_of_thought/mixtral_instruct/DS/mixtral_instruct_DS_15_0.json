We have two possible locations for the shoes: the closet or lined up by the door.\n2. The second statement tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n3. Since we know that one of the two possibilities must be true, and the other option (shoes being lined up by the door) has been ruled out, it follows that the remaining possibility (shoes being in the closet) must be true.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and applying logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that 'The shoes are in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
