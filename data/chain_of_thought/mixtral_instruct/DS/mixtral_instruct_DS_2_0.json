We have two statements about the book's location: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" and \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n2. The first statement presents two possible locations for the book: the shelf or the table.\n3. The second statement confirms that the book is not at one of those locations (the table).\n4. Since there are no other options given, and we know the book isn't on the table, it must be in the remaining location mentioned in the first statement: the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
