We are given the statement: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\" This is an example of a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. Next, we are told that \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\" This negates one part of the original disjunction.\n3. Since the statement \"The missing sock is under the bed\" has been proven false, by process of elimination, the only remaining option from the original disjunction must be true: \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
