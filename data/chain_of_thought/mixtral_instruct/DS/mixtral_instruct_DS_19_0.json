We have two possible locations for the watch: either it's charging on the dresser or it's on his wrist.\n2. Then we are told that the watch is not on his wrist.\n3. Since the only other option provided is that the watch is charging on the dresser, and we know it's not on his wrist, we can infer by process of elimination that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
