We have two possible states for the jacket: it is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n2. We are told that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n3. Based on this information, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n4. This is an application of the process of elimination, which is a valid form of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
