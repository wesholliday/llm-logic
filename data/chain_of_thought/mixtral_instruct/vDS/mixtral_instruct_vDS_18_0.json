This can be represented as P or Q (P = Notebook is in the drawer, Q = Notebook is on the nightstand).\n2. The second premise eliminates one option by stating that the notebook is not on the nightstand (~Q).\n3. The conclusion then affirms the remaining option, that the notebook is in the drawer (P).\n\nThis form of argument follows a structure known as Disjunctive Syllogism, which is logically valid. It eliminates one possibility and concludes with the other possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
