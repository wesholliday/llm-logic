This is a disjunction, represented as P v Q.\n2. The second premise rules out one of those possibilities by stating that the missing sock is not under the bed. This negates Q, giving us ~Q.\n3. The conclusion then affirms that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. This is the remaining possibility from the first premise, represented as P.\n4. Given these steps, if both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true because there's no other possible location for the missing sock.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid according to the principles of deductive reasoning.",
