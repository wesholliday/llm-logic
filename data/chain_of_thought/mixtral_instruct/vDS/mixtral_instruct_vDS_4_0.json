The second premise asserts that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n3. Given these two premises, there are no other possibilities for the cat's location except the couch since it cannot be in the bedroom.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the cat is napping on the couch logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
