            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise presents two mutually exclusive options: either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry. This can be represented as P v Q, where P represents 'the cookies are in the jar' and Q represents 'the cookies are hidden in the pantry'.\n2. The second premise states that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry, which is the negation of Q (~Q).\n3. The conclusion asserts that the cookies are in the jar, which is P.\n4. Given the first and second premises, if Q is false (the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry), then P must be true (the cookies are in the jar) for the argument to hold. This follows the rules of logical disjunction (P v Q).\n5. Therefore, if both premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
