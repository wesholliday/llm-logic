This is an example of a disjunction, which means that one (and only one) of these statements must be true.\n   \n2. The second premise asserts that the pen is not on the desk. \n\n3. Given the truth of the second premise, we can eliminate the possibility that the pen is on the desk from our consideration.\n\n4. With only one possibility remaining (the pen being in the bag), and no information provided to contradict this possibility, it follows that the pen must be in the bag.\n\n5. Therefore, the conclusion 'The pen is in my bag' is a logical consequence of the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
