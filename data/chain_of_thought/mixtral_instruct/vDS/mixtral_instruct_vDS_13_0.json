This is an example of a disjunction, which means that one (and only one) of these statements must be true.\n2. The second premise asserts that the toy is not on the shelf.\n3. Given the first and second premises, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box because it cannot be on the shelf. This follows logically from the initial disjunction presented in the first premise.\n4. Therefore, if both premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
