This is an example of a disjunction, which means that one (and only one) of these statements must be true.\n2. The second premise asserts that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n3. Given the first and second premises, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece must therefore be in the box. This follows logically from the principle of disjunction elimination (also known as proof by cases), which states that if you have established that one or more disjuncts must be true, and you have also established that some particular disjunct is true, then you can validly infer that that disjunct is the true one.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
