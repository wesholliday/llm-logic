This is a disjunction, meaning that one (and only one) of these possibilities must be true.\n2. The second premise asserts that the second possibility - the milk being in the fridge - is not the case.\n3. Given the first and second premises, we can infer that the other possibility - the milk being on the counter - must be the case.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that 'The milk is on the counter' logically follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
