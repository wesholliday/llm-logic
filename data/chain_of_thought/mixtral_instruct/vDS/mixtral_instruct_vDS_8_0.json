This can be represented as P v Q, where P represents 'the remote control is on the coffee table' and Q represents 'it is hiding under the couch'.\n2. The second premise rules out one of those possibilities by stating that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch (~Q).\n3. The conclusion then asserts that the remote control must be on the coffee table (P).\n\nThis form of argument follows a pattern known as disjunctive syllogism, which is logically valid. Disjunctive syllogism involves rejecting one possibility from a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and concluding that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
