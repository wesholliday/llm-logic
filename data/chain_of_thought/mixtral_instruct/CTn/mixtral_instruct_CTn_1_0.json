            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then q\". Specifically, it says \"if Mary was at the wedding (p), then Sue was not at the wedding (not q)\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"if Sue was at the wedding (q), then Mary was not at the wedding (not p)\".\n3. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n4. However, just because two statements are logically equivalent does not mean that one can be inferred from the other based on the information given.\n5. In this case, we do not have enough information to determine whether Sue was or was not at the wedding, so we cannot definitively say whether the contrapositive is true or false.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' based solely on the given statement.",
