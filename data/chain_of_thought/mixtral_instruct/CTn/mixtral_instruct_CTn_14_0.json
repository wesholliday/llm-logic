            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be written as P -> Q, where P represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q represents \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is (~Q) -> (~P), or \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n3. To find the contrapositive, we negate both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and reverse their order. The negation of P is ~P, which means \"the bear was not in the cave,\" and the negation of Q is ~Q, which means \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n4. Thus, the contrapositive is indeed (~Q) -> (~P), or \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n5. In logic, the contrapositive of a true statement is also true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, we can infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes, if the original statement is true, we can infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.'",
