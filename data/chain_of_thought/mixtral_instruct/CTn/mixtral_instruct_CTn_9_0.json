            "content": " To answer this question, let's first break down the given conditional statement and then examine whether its converse holds true.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: Lisa(red) -> ~Mark(blue).\n\nNow, let's consider the desired statement: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This is represented as: Mark(blue) -> ~Lisa(red).\n\nTo determine if these two statements are logically equivalent, we can use a truth table or apply logical transformations. Here, I'll demonstrate using logical equivalences.\n\n1. Start with the original statement: Lisa(red) -> ~Mark(blue)\n2. To negate this implication, we can apply De Morgan's law and Material Implication: ~(Lisa(red) -> ~Mark(blue)) = Lisa(red) ^ Mark(blue)\n3. Now, let's derive the desired statement from the result above:\n   a. Lisa(red) ^ Mark(blue) (given)\n   b. To get the desired implication, we need to show that if Mark bought the blue shirt (Mark(blue)), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~Lisa(red)).\n   c. From step 3a, since both Lisa and Mark have bought their respective shirts, removing one part of the conjunction leaves us with Mark(blue).\n   d. However, this does not provide enough information to infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
