            "content": " To approach this question, let's first break down the given conditional statement:\n\n1. If the apple was red (A \u2192 R), then the banana was not yellow (\u00acY).\n\nThe arrow represents implication, and the negation symbol (\u00ac) denotes 'not'. Now, we want to determine if the converse of this statement is true. The converse switches the hypothesis and conclusion:\n\n1. If the banana was yellow (B \u2192 Y), then the apple was not red (\u00acR).\n\nTo decide whether these two statements are equivalent, let's consider their truth values. There are four possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The apple is red, and the banana is yellow. In this case, both the original statement and its converse would be false.\n\nScenario 2: The apple is not red (it could be green or any other color), and the banana is not yellow (it could be green, brown, or any other color). In this case, both statements would be true.\n\nScenario 3: The apple is red, and the banana is not yellow. This scenario makes the original statement true but its converse false.\n\nScenario 4: The apple is not red, and the banana is yellow. This scenario makes the original statement false but its converse true.\n\nSince there are scenarios where only one of the statements is true (while the other is false), we cannot infer that 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'. They are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
