The original statement can be written as \u00acA -> \u00acB, where '->' denotes implication (if...then) and '\u00ac' denotes negation.\n\nNow we want to determine if the converse of this statement is true: \u00acB -> \u00acA, which states \"If the pants are denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\"\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement does not necessarily have to be true just because the original statement is true. However, in some cases like this one, it can be shown that the converse is indeed logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo show this equivalence, we can use a technique called contrapositive transformation. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \u00acA -> \u00acB is B -> A. If we negate both sides of our given statement, we get:\n\n\u00ac(\u00acA -> \u00acB) = A ^ B (where '^' denotes conjunction, or 'and')\n\nNow, taking the contrapositive of A ^ B gives us \u00acB -> \u00acA, which is exactly what we wanted to prove. Therefore, yes, we can infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement.",
