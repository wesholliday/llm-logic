            "content": " To answer this question, let's first examine the given statement:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\". In this case, P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n2. If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nThis is also a conditional statement but in reverse order. To determine if this can be inferred from the original statement, let's analyze both statements together.\n\nIf the first statement is true (P -> Q), we cannot directly infer the second statement (Q -> P) without additional information. The first statement only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the mummy is awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
