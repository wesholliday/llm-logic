The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. So, the contrapositive of \"James wrote \u27f9 \u00acMystery\" is:\n\nContrapositive: Mystery \u27f9 \u00acJames wrote\n\nSince this is a logically equivalent form of the original statement, we can infer that 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
