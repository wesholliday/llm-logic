            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given conditional statement and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents 'Joe went to the park' and Q represents 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\". In our case, this translates to 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'.\n3. To form the contrapositive, we negate both parts of the original statement and reverse their order:\n   - Not Q: Lucy went to the zoo\n   - Not P: Joe went to the park\n4. Comparing the given statement with the inferred contrapositive, we can see that they are logically equivalent since they only differ in the order of their components.\n5. Therefore, based on the logic rules, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
