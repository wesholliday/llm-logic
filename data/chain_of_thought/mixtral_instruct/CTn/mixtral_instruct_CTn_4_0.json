The first statement is in the form P -> Q, where P represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q represents \"the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n2. To check if we can infer the second statement, which is in the form R -> S (where R stands for \"the robot visited Jupiter\" and S stands for \"the alien did not visit Mars\"), we need to examine the relationship between P and Q and see if it implies a relationship between R and S.\n3. In this case, the first statement tells us that the presence of an alien on Mars excludes the possibility of a robot visiting Jupiter (and vice versa).\n4. However, this information does not directly link the robot's visit to Jupiter with the alien's absence on Mars or vice versa.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
