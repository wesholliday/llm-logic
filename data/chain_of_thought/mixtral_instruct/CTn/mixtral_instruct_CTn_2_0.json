If the griffin was in the forest (G \u2192 F), then the unicorn was not in the forest (\u00acU).\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this conditional statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. So, let's find the contrapositive:\n\n1. If the unicorn was in the forest (U), then the griffin was not in the forest (\u00acG).\n\nSince this is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer it as true if the original statement is true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
