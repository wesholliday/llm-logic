If Jeff played basketball (antecedent), then Amy did not play tennis (consequent).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer the converse of this statement:\n\n2. If Amy played tennis (antecedent), then Jeff did not play basketball (consequent).\n\nTo determine whether the given statement implies its converse, let's consider two possible scenarios where the original statement is true:\n\nScenario A: Jeff played basketball and Amy did not play tennis.\nScenario B: Jeff did not play basketball and Amy also did not play tennis.\n\nIn Scenario A, if we assume that the given statement is true, then the converse cannot be true because Amy did not play tennis in this scenario, yet the converse states that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nIn Scenario B, both the given statement and its converse are false since neither Jeff nor Amy played their respective sports.\n\nSince there is at least one scenario (Scenario A) where the given statement is true but its converse is false, we cannot infer that the converse is always true based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
