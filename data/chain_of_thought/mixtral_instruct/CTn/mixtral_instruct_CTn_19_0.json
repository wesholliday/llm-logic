If Tom watched football (T), then Jen did not watch basketball (\u00acB).\n\nWe want to determine if we can validly infer the converse of this statement:\n\n1. If Jen watched basketball (B), then Tom did not watch football (\u00acT).\n\nTo check whether the given statement implies its converse, let's examine possible scenarios using a truth table or by considering various cases:\n\n- Case 1: Tom watches football (T) and Jen does not watch basketball (\u00acB). This case aligns with the given statement.\n- Case 2: Tom does not watch football (\u00acT) and Jen watches basketball (B). In this case, the converse is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the given statement implies its converse.\n\nSince there is at least one scenario where the given statement and its converse have different truth values, we cannot infer the converse from the given statement. Therefore:\n\nAnswer: No.",
