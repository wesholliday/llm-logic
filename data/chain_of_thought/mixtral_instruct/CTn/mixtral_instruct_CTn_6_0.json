If Sue chose pizza (S), then Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acP).\n\nWe want to determine if we can validly infer the converse of this statement:\n\n1. If Bob chose pasta (P), then Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acS).\n\nTo do this, let's examine the truth values for each statement and see if they maintain consistency:\n\n- When Sue chooses pizza (S is true), and Bob does not choose pasta (\u00acP is true), the original statement is true. In this case, the converse would be false because Sue did indeed choose pizza.\n- However, when Sue does not choose pizza (\u00acS is true) and Bob chooses pasta (P is true), the original statement is also true. In this case, the converse is also true because Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince the truth values of both statements are consistent with each other, we can infer the converse: 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
