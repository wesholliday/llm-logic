            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statement and examine its logical structure:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\". In our case, this translates to \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n3. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n4. However, without knowing whether the original statement is true or false, we cannot definitively say whether its contrapositive is true or false either.\n5. Based on the information provided, we can only conclude that *if* the original statement is true, then its contrapositive \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, if the original statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train' is true, then its contrapositive 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane' must also be true.",
