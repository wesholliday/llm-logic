The original statement is in the form of a contrapositive, which means that if Alex finishing the race implies that Chris did not finish the race, then we can infer that if Chris had finished the race, Alex would not have.\n2. This is because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n3. Therefore, based on the given information and applying logical reasoning, we can indeed infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
