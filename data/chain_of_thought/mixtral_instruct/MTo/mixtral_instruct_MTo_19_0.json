            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that \"Jen did not watch basketball\" is true.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\".\n3. To determine if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\", let's consider the possible scenarios in which the first two statements are true:\n   - Scenario A: Tom did not watch football and Jen did not watch basketball.\n   - Scenario B: Tom watched football and Jen did not watch basketball.\n4. In Scenario A, both given statements are true. However, we cannot rule out Scenario B based solely on the information provided.\n5. If the second statement were true in Scenario B (Tom watched football but Jen still didn't watch basketball), then the first statement would be false. But since the first statement is true, Scenario B cannot be the case.\n6. Therefore, by process of elimination, we can conclude that Scenario A must be true: Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
