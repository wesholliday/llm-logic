            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if its condition is true. The condition here is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n3. If Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the second statement, Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n4. However, we know from the first statement that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n5. Therefore, since the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) leads to a contradiction (Mark both buying and not buying the blue shirt), we can infer that the condition is false.\n6. Hence, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
