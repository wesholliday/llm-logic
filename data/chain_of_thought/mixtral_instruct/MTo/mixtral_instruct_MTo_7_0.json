The second statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n3. However, we already know that Chris did not finish the race.\n4. Therefore, based on this information, it is impossible for Alex to have finished the race because, according to the second statement, if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would also have finished.\n5. Since Chris didn't finish the race, we can conclude that Alex must not have finished either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
