We also know that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den (stated as 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den').\n3. However, we have been told that the wolf is not in the den.\n4. Therefore, since the condition for the wolf being in the den is that the bear must be in the cave, and we know the wolf is not in the den, it follows that the bear cannot be in the cave either.\n5. This is because if the bear were in the cave, then according to the given statement, the wolf would also have to be in the den, which contradicts what we already know (that the wolf is not in the den).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
