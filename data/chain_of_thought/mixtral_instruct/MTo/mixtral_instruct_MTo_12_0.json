            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if its condition is true. The condition here is 'Joe went to the park'.\n3. If Joe had gone to the park, then according to the second statement, Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n4. However, we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n5. Therefore, since the condition (Joe going to the park) leads to a contradiction (Lucy being at the zoo), we can infer that the condition must be false.\n6. So, yes, we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
