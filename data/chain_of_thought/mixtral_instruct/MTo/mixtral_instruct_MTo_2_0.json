Our second piece of information is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest,\" let's consider what would happen if the griffin were indeed in the forest.\n4. According to our second piece of information, if the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest.\n5. However, we know from our first piece of information that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n6. Therefore, it cannot be true that the griffin is in the forest, because that would contradict our information about the unicorn.\n7. Thus, we can indeed infer \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
