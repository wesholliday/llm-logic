From these two statements, we want to determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red'.\n4. To do this, let's consider what it would mean for the apple to be red. If the apple were red, then according to the second statement, the banana would have to be yellow.\n5. However, we know from the first statement that the banana is not yellow. Therefore, if the condition in the second statement (the apple being red) were true, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n6. To avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the condition in the second statement (the apple being red) is false, which means 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
