Our second piece of information is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', let's consider what this conditional statement means. It tells us that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, we already know from our first piece of information that the pants are not denim.\n\nSince the pants cannot be denim even if the shirt is cotton, it follows that the shirt being cotton would lead to a contradiction with the given information. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
