Our second piece of information is a conditional statement: 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n3. To determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', let's consider what would happen if the cake were chocolate. According to our second piece of information, if the cake were chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry.\n4. However, we know from our first piece of information that the muffins are not blueberry. Therefore, it cannot be true that the cake is chocolate, because that would contradict what we know about the muffins.\n5. So, since the cake cannot be chocolate, it must be some other flavor.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
