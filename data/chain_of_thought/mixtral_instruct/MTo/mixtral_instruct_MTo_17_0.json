The second statement is a conditional statement: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n3. To infer whether Ben did not eat pasta or not, we need to examine the truth value of the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) and consequent (Kate ate the salad) in the given conditional statement.\n4. Since Kate did not eat the salad, it means that the consequent is false.\n5. In logic, when the consequent is false, the whole conditional statement is considered false only if the antecedent is true.\n6. However, since we don't have any information about whether Ben ate pasta or not, we cannot assume the truth value of the antecedent.\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
