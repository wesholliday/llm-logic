The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\".\n3. To determine if we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball', let's consider the possible scenarios when this conditional statement is true:\n   - Jeff plays basketball and Amy plays tennis.\n   - Jeff does not play basketball and Amy does not play tennis.\n4. Since we know that Amy did not play tennis, the only scenario where the second statement can be true is the second one, where 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
