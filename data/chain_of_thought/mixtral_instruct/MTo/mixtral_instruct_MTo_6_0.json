To infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', we need to show that the condition for the second statement is false.\n4. If Bob didn't choose pasta, as stated in (1), then the condition for the second statement ('Bob chose pasta') must be false.\n5. Since the condition is false, it follows that Sue did not choose pizza because if she had, the condition would have been true and Bob would have chosen pasta, which contradicts what we know.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
