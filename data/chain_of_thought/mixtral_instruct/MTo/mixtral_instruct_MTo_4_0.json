We also know that 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The alien did not visit Mars' can be inferred, let's consider what would happen if the alien had visited Mars.\n4. If the alien had visited Mars, then according to point 2, the robot would have visited Jupiter.\n5. However, we know from point 1 that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n6. Therefore, it is impossible for the alien to have visited Mars because that would contradict our knowledge that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n7. Since it is impossible for the alien to have visited Mars given the information provided, we can indeed infer that 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
