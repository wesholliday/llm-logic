We also know that \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n3. To infer whether \"the book was not written by James,\" we need to examine if there's a connection between the two statements provided.\n4. The second statement essentially tells us that any book written by James is a mystery novel.\n5. Given the first statement, which says the book is not a mystery novel, it contradicts the possibility of the book being written by James (since, according to the second statement, books written by James are mystery novels).\n6. Therefore, based on the given statements and their logical relationship, we can indeed infer that \"the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
