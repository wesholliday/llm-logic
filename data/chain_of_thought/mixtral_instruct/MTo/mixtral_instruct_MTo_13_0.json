            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'The truck was not blue'. This is our first piece of information.\n2. Our second piece of information is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. \n\nLet's analyze the second statement more closely. It's a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. The 'if' part (the car being red) is called the hypothesis, and the 'then' part (the truck being blue) is called the conclusion.\n\n3. Now, we know that the conclusion of our second statement is false because we were told in the first statement that 'The truck was not blue'.\n4. Given that the conclusion is false, can we conclude that the hypothesis must also be false? Not necessarily. In logic, there's a term for this situation: \"denying the consequent\". It does not allow us to definitively say that the car cannot be red.\n5. In fact, it's possible that the car is any color other than red, and the truck could still not be blue. For example, the truck could be green, yellow, or any other color but blue.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The car was not red'.",
