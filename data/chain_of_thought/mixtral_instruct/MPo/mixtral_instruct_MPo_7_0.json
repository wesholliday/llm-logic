We also know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race as well (this is called a conditional statement).\n3. To determine whether we can infer that Chris finished the race, let's use logical reasoning:\n   - The given conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents \"Alex finished the race\" and Q represents \"Chris finished the race\".\n   - Since we know that P is true (Alex finished the race), we can apply Modus Ponens, which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must be true.\n   - Therefore, since both the conditional statement and its antecedent (P) are true, it follows that Chris also finished the race (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
