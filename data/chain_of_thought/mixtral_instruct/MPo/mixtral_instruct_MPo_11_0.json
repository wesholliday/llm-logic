In this case, P represents 'the cake was chocolate', and Q represents 'the muffins were blueberry'.\nStep 5: Given that P (the cake being chocolate) is true, we can apply Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference.\nStep 6: Modus Ponens states that from 'If P, then Q' and 'P', we can infer 'Q'. In this case, since the cake was chocolate (P is true), we can indeed infer that the muffins were blueberry (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
