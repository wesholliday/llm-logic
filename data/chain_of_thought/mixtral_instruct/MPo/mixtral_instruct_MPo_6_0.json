We are also given a conditional statement: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n3. In logic, when we have a true antecedent (the 'if' part) and a true conditional statement, the consequent (the 'then' part) must be true as well.\n4. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sue chose pizza', which is true according to the first piece of information.\n5. The conditional statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is also given as true.\n6. Therefore, since both the antecedent and the conditional statement are true, it follows that the consequent 'Bob chose pasta' must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
