            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n1. We know that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is a true statement.\n2. We also have the conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that \"The unicorn was in the forest,\" we need to apply Modus Ponens, a valid form of logical reasoning where if both the antecedent (if-part) and the consequent (then-part) are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n4. In this case, the antecedent is \"The griffin was in the forest,\" which we know to be true. The consequent is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n5. Since both parts of the conditional statement are true, we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
