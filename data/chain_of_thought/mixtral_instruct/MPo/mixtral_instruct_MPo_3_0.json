            "content": " To answer this question, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. We know that 'The book was written by James.' This statement tells us who wrote the book but does not provide any information about the genre of the book.\n2. We also know that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' This is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true.\n3. To determine whether we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel,' we need to check if the conditions for applying the conditional statement are met. In other words, we need to ensure that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n4. The antecedent in this case is 'the book was written by James.' Since we already know this to be true from the first statement, we can apply the conditional statement.\n5. Therefore, since the antecedent is true and the conditional statement holds that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, we can indeed infer 'The book is a mystery novel.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
