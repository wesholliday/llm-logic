Here, P represents 'The dog was inside' and Q represents 'The cat was outside'.\nStep 5: Given that P is true (the dog was indeed inside), we can now apply Modus Ponens logical rule.\nStep 6: Modus Ponens states that if 'If P, then Q' is true and P is true, then Q must be true.\nStep 7: In this case, since the dog was inside (P is true) and 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is true, it follows that 'The cat was outside' (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
