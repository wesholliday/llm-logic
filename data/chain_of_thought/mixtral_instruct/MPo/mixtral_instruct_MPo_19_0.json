We also know that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow let's think about what these statements mean logically:\n- The second statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It means that *if* the condition (Tom watching football) is true, *then* the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n- In this case, since we know that Tom did indeed watch football, the condition of the second statement is true.\n- Therefore, according to the logic of the second statement, the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
