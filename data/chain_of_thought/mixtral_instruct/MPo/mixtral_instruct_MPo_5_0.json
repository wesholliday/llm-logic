We also know the conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n3. A conditional statement has two parts: the hypothesis (or antecedent) and the conclusion (or consequent). In this case, the hypothesis is 'Jeff played basketball' and the conclusion is 'Amy played tennis'.\n4. Given that the hypothesis is true (because we know Jeff played basketball), we can apply a rule of logic called Modus Ponens, which states: if p -> q is true and p is true, then q must be true. Here, p represents the hypothesis ('Jeff played basketball') and q represents the conclusion ('Amy played tennis').\n5. Therefore, since both the hypothesis and the conditional statement are true, we can indeed infer that 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
