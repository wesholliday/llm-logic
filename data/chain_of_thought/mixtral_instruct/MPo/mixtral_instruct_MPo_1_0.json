We also know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the statements:\n- The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it has an if-then structure. In this case, the condition (if part) is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and the conclusion (then part) is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n- Since we already know that \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the first statement, and this matches the condition in the second statement, it follows logically that the conclusion of the second statement must be true as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'Sue was at the wedding.'\nAnswer: yes",
