The second statement says 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement where the condition (Joe going to the park) leads to a consequence (Lucy going to the zoo).\n3. Given that the condition has been met (as per the first statement), it follows logically that the consequence should also be true.\n4. Therefore, based on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
