If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Premise 2 - Conditional Statement).\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that 'The wolf was in the den' based on these two premises. To do this, let's apply Modus Ponens, a valid form of argument in logic:\n\nModus Ponens:\nP1: If P, then Q\nP2: P\nC: Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n- P represents 'The bear was in the cave' (Premise 1).\n- Q represents 'The wolf was in the den' (from Premise 2).\n\nNow let's see if we can apply Modus Ponens here:\n\nPremise 1 (P): The bear was in the cave.\nPremise 2 (P -> Q): If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nSince Premise 1 (P) is true, and Premise 2 (P -> Q) is also true, we can apply Modus Ponens to infer that 'The wolf was in the den' (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
