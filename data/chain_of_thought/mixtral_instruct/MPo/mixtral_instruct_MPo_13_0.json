            "content": " Step 1: We have been given two statements - 'The car was red' (premise 1) and 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' (premise 2).\n\nStep 2: In logic, this second statement is called a conditional statement. It consists of an antecedent ('the car was red') and a consequent ('the truck was blue').\n\nStep 3: The truth table for conditionals tells us that if the antecedent is true and the consequent is also true, then the entire statement is true. However, if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, then the entire statement is false.\n\nStep 4: Given premise 1 ('The car was red'), we know that the antecedent of our conditional statement (premise 2) is true.\n\nStep 5: To determine whether 'The truck was blue' follows logically, we need to look at the truth value of the consequent in relation to the truth value of the entire conditional statement.\n\nStep 6: Since the antecedent is true and the whole conditional statement is true, it must be the case that the consequent is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
