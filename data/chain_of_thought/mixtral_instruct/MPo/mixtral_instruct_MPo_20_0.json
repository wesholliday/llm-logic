            "content": " To approach this question, let's break it down into steps:\n1. We have the statement \"The apple was red.\" This is a given fact.\n2. Then we have the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logic, this type of statement is called a hypothetical or conditional statement, often denoted as P -> Q (if P, then Q).\n3. To determine if we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from these two statements, we need to apply Modus Ponens, which is a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus Ponens states that if you have the premises \"P -> Q\" and \"P\", then you can infer \"Q\".\n4. In this case, our given fact (P) is 'The apple was red', and our conditional statement (P -> Q) is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n5. Since we have both premises, we can apply Modus Ponens to infer \"Q\", which in this case is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
