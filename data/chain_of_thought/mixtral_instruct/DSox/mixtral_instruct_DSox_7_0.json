We also know that 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked'. This statement presents two possibilities for the state of the whiffle: either it's 'shanked' or 'tinked'.\n3. Given that we already know the whiffle is not 'tinked', we can eliminate one possibility from the second statement.\n4. With only one possibility remaining, we can now conclude that the whiffle must be 'shanked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
