Statement B can be broken down into two possibilities: the clug is either fleeked or snugged.\n4. However, statement A tells us that the clug is not snugged.\n5. Therefore, based on the process of elimination from statement B and the information from statement A, we can infer that 'The clug is fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
