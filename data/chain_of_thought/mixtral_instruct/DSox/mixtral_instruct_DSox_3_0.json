Then we have the statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked'. This is a logical disjunction, meaning one *or* the other condition must be true.\n3. Given that the splat is not quanked, we can eliminate the second half of this disjunction ('it is quanked').\n4. That leaves us with 'The splat is morphed' as the only remaining possibility from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
