The second statement is \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed\". This means that there are only two possible states for the flug: it can be either blummed or zimmed.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the flug is not in the zimmed state, and the second statement tells us that those are the only two possibilities, it logically follows that the flug must be in the other possible state: blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
