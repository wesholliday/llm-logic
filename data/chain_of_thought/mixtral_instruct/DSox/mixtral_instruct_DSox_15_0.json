The second statement is \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened\". This gives us two possibilities: either the dreb was vroombed, or it was spent.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the dreb was not spent, then by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
