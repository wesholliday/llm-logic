We also know that 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garbled'. This is a disjunction, meaning that one (or both) of the two statements must be true.\n3. Since we already know that 'The wug is not garbled', the only remaining possibility from the second statement is 'the wug is sproinged'.\n4. Therefore, based on this information, we can indeed infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
