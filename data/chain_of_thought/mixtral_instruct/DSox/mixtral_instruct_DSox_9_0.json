The second statement says, 'Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked'. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that the twonk is not plinked, this leaves us with only one option: 'The twonk is varnished'.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
