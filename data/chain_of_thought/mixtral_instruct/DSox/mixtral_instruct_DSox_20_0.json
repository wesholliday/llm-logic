We also know that 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned'. This gives us two possibilities for the state of the fleeg: it is either bluttered or surned.\n3. However, since we already know that 'The fleeg is not surned', the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
