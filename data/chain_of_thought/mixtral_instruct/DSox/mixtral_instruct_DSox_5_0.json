We also know that 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled'. This statement presents two possibilities: either the zinger is fraggled, or it is smoogled.\n3. However, we already know from the first statement that the zinger is not smoogled. \n4. Since the second statement only provides us with two possible conditions for the zinger (fraggled or smoogled), and one of those possibilities has been ruled out, we can now conclude that the remaining possibility must be true.\n5. Therefore, since the zinger cannot be smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
