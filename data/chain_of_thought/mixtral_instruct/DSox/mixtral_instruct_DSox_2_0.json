We also know that 'Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed'. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the wug is not bimmed. Therefore, the second statement reduces to 'The wug is flooped'.\n4. Since we have no information that contradicts this statement, and it is logically possible for the wug to be flooped, we can infer that 'The wug is flooped' is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
