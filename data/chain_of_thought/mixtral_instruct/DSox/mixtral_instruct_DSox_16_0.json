The second statement is \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted\". This can be broken down into two possibilities: a) The sneg is crampled, or b) The sneg is sproted.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the second possibility (b) is false because the sneg is not sproted.\n4. Therefore, since only one of the two possibilities can be true, and we've determined that possibility (b) is false, it must mean that possibility (a) is true.\n5. So, yes, we can infer 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
