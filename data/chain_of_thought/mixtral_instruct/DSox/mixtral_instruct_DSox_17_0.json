The second statement is \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated.\" This means that there are only two possibilities for the state of the flob: it is either skizzled or movated.\n3. Given that we know from the first statement that the flob is not in the movated state, and considering the second statement's two possibilities, it follows logically that the flob must be in the other possible state: skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
