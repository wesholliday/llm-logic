We also know that 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged'. This statement presents two possibilities: either the smonk is vreebled, or it is plagged.\n3. Given that we already know that the smonk is not plagged, we can eliminate one of those possibilities from the second statement.\n4. Therefore, since the smonk cannot be plagged, it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
