The second statement is 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked'. \n3. Since we know that the fribble is not crinkled, we can eliminate that part of the disjunction (the 'or' statement).\n4. This leaves us with 'The fribble is snurgled', which must be true because the other option has been proven false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
