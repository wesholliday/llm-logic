We also know that 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped'. This means that there are only two possible states for the grommet: either it is sploffed or it is plopped.\n3. Since we already know that the grommet is not plopped, and we also know that the grommet can only be in one of two states (sploffed or plopped), it follows logically that the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
