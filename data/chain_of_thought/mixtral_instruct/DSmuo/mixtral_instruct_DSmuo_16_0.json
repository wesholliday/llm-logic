We know that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" means that it is possible for the pen to not be on the desk.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\". This can be broken down into two parts: a) The pen is in my bag, or b) The pen must be on my desk.\n3. Since we know from point 1 that it's possible for the pen to not be on the desk, option b cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, option a must be true: The pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
