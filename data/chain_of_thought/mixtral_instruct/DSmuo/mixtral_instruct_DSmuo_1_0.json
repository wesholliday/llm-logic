From the first statement, we know it's possible for Fido to be somewhere other than the garden. \n4. From the second statement, if Fido isn't in the garden right now, then he must be inside.\n5. Given that both statements are true, they can coexist without contradiction. Therefore, yes, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
