This means that there is no requirement or necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head.\n2. We also know that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. \n3. Since we now know from point 1 that the sunglasses do not have to be perched on her head, it follows logically that the other option in the disjunction must be true: the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
