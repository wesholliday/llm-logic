We know that \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This means that it is possible for the keys to not be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. We also know that \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This is an 'exclusive or' statement, meaning only one of these options can be true.\n3. Given the first statement, we know it's possible for the keys to not be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, based on the second statement, the other option must be true: the keys are in the drawer.\n4. To confirm, if the keys were still in the cabinet but not dangling, then neither statement would hold true. But since we know the first statement is true, the keys cannot be in the cabinet at all.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
