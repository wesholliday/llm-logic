We know that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is possible for the toy to not be on the bookshelf. It does not exclude the possibility of the toy being in the toy box or any other location.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\", presents two possibilities: a) the toy is in the toy box, or b) the toy must be on the bookshelf.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the toy not to be on the bookshelf, this means that option b cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is option a: the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
