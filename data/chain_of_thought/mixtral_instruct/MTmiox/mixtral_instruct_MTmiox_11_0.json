We know that 'The flug might not have been zimmed' which means that it is possible for the flug not to be zimmed (but we don't know for sure).\n2. We also know that 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed'. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the flug was indeed blummed, then it would have definitely been zimmed.\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the flug was blummed.\n4. Given only these two pieces of information, we cannot definitively say 'The flug was not blummed'. It's possible that the flug wasn't zimmed even if it was blummed. We just don't know because there isn't enough information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
