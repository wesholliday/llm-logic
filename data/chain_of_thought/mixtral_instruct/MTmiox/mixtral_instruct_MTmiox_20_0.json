If this were true, then it couldn't have been bluttered according to the second statement because being bluttered requires the fleeg to have been surned beforehand.\n- However, just because the fleeg might not have been surned doesn't necessarily mean that it wasn't. It only tells us that there is a possibility it wasn't.\n\nSo based on this reasoning, we cannot definitively infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
