We also know that the sprocket might not have been daggled (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B, we cannot definitively say that the sprocket was not cranked because there is a possibility that the sprocket was indeed cranked but some other factor prevented it from being daggled.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
