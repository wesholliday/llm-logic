We also know that the shank might not have been nugged (let's call this statement B).\n3. If statement B is true, then it means that the shank was either never plooked or was plooked but not nugged.\n4. However, according to statement A, if the shank was plooked, it must be nugged as well.\n5. Since we know from statement B that the shank might not have been nugged, this implies that the shank could not have been both plooked and not nugged at the same time (because that would contradict statement A).\n6. Therefore, if the shank was not nugged, it could not have been plooked either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
