The first statement is \"The flob might not have moved.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the flob did not move (however, it does not rule out the possibility that the flob could have moved).\n2. The second statement is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\" This means that if we know for certain that the flob is skizzled, then it necessarily followed that the flob moved.\n\nNow let's consider whether we can infer 'The flob was not skizzled' based on this information:\n\nWe cannot directly infer 'The flob was not skizzled'. The given statements only tell us about a possible relationship between the flob being skizzled and moving, but they do not provide any concrete evidence that the flob is not skizzled. It could still be possible that the flob moved without being skizzled or even that it did not move at all.\n\nAnswer: No.",
