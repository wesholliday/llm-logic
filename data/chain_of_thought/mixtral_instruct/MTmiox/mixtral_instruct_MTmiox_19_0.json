However, we are told that the smonk might not have plagged (first statement), which implies that there is a possibility that the smonk did not plag.\n3. If the smonk did not plag, then based on our understanding from point 1, the smonk cannot be vreebled.\n4. Therefore, given these statements, we can indeed infer that 'The smonk was not vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
