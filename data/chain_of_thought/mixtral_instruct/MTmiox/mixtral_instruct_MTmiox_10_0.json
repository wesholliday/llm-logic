This statement implies that there is a possibility that the wug was not garbled.\n2. The second statement is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garbled'. This means that if the wug underwent the action of being sproinged, then it would definitely be garbled.\n3. However, we don't know whether the wug was actually sproinged or not. The given information doesn't provide any details about the wug being sproinged.\n4. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively conclude 'The wug was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
