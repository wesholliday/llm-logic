In other words, it only tells us that if the vampire is awake (P), then the mummy will be awake (Q). However, it does not guarantee that if the mummy is awake (Q), then the vampire must also be awake (P).\n\nStep 3: To determine whether we can infer \"if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake,\" we need to consider whether the given information allows us to make this conclusion. In this case, it does not. The original statement only provides a sufficient condition for the mummy's awakeness (vampire being awake), but it does not provide a necessary condition.\n\nAnswer: No.",
