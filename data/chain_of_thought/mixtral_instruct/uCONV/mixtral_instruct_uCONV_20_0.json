We know that \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical or material implication.\n2. However, just because the first part of the statement is true (the apple being red), it doesn't automatically mean that the second part (the banana being yellow) is also true. It could be that the banana was yellow for some other reason.\n3. Similarly, even if the second part of the statement is true (the banana being yellow), it doesn't necessarily imply that the first part (the apple being red) must be true as well. The color of the apple and the color of the banana could be independent of each other.\n4. So, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
