However, we don't have any information about the reverse situation - whether if the pants are denim, then the shirt is cotton. \n3. Just because A implies B does not necessarily mean that B implies A. This is a common misconception in logic.\n4. Therefore, even though it's true that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
