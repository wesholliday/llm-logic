We know that \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. However, just because the doll being plastic implies the truck is metal, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic. There could be other materials for the doll.\n3. So, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
