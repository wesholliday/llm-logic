We know that \"if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, often written as \"Joe -> Lucy\" for simplicity.\n2. We want to determine if \"if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park,\" or \"Lucy -> Joe.\"\n3. From the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Lucy -> Joe.\" The original statement only tells us that Joe's visit to the park preceded Lucy's visit to the zoo, not that they are directly linked in both directions.\n4. It could be possible that Joe went to the park and then Lucy decided to go to the zoo independently of Joe's actions. In this case, even if Lucy went to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean that Joe had to go to the park first.\n\nAnswer: No.",
