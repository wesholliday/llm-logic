However, just because the first part of the statement is true (Sue being at the wedding), it doesn't necessarily mean the second part is also true (Mary being at the wedding).\n3. It could be that Sue was at the wedding for some other reason and not because Mary was there.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
