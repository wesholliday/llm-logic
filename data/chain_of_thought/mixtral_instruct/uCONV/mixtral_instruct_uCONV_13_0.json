However, we don't have enough information to conclude that if the truck was blue, then the car must have been red. This would be assuming the converse of the original statement without knowing whether it's true or not.\n3. The given statement only tells us what color the truck was when the car was red. It doesn't tell us anything about the color of the car when the truck is blue.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.",
