We know that \"if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, often written as \"Sam takes a plane \u2192 Erin takes a train.\"\n2. The question now asks if we can infer the reverse of this statement: \"if Erin takes a train, then Sam takes a plane,\" or \"Erin takes a train \u2192 Sam takes a plane.\"\n3. Just because one conditional statement is true, it doesn't automatically mean that its converse is also true.\n4. In this case, we don't have enough information to determine whether Erin taking a train implies that Sam took a plane. It could be the case, but there could also be situations where Erin takes a train for some other reason, unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No.",
