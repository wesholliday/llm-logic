            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be written in logical notation as (C \u2192 D), where C represents \"the shirt is cotton\" and D represents \"the pants are denim\".\n2. The second statement tells us that there's a possibility that the pants were not denim: \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This can be written in logical notation as \u00acD (read as \"not D\").\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (\u00acC) based on these two statements.\n4. However, from these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was not cotton. The second statement only tells us about the possibility of the pants not being denim, but it doesn't provide any information about the material of the shirt.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The shirt was not cotton\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
