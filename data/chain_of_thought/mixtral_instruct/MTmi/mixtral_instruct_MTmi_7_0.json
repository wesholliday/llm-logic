The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is in the form of p -> q, where p represents \"Alex finished the race\" and q represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n2. The second statement tells us that there's a possibility that Chris didn't finish the race: \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This can be represented as ~q (not q).\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that Alex did not finish the race (~p).\n4. However, just because there's a possibility that Chris didn't finish the race (~q), it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex didn't finish the race (~p). It could be the case that both Alex and Chris finished the race but Chris came in last.\n5. Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer that \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
