            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a type of logical statement known as a hypothetical or conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n2. We are also told that \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal. \n3. To determine whether we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic,\" we need to consider the truth of the consequence (the truck being metal) based on the second statement. If the truck might not have been metal, then it's possible that the consequence is false.\n4. However, if the consequence is false, then according to the conditional statement given in step 1, the condition must also be false. Therefore, if the truck might not have been metal, then it's possible that the doll was not plastic.\n5. But we cannot definitively say that the doll was not plastic based on this information alone. It's possible, but not certain.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that \"The doll was not plastic\" with certainty based on these statements.",
