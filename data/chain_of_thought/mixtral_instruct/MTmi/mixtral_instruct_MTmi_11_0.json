The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that if the cake being chocolate is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n2. However, the second statement tells us that \"The muffins might not have been blueberry,\" which implies that there's a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n3. From this information alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was not chocolate because it's possible that the muffins could still be blueberry despite the second statement. The first statement only tells us what would happen if the cake were chocolate; it doesn't prevent the possibility of the muffins being another flavor.\n\nAnswer: No.",
