            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. We are also told that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that Sue's presence is uncertain, which implies that either Sue was at the wedding or she wasn't. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"Q or not Q\" (where Q still represents \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n3. Now we need to determine whether we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on this information. To do so, let's examine both possibilities for Sue:\n   a. If Sue was at the wedding, then according to our first statement, Mary must have been there as well. However, since we don't know for sure whether Sue was at the wedding, we can't definitively say that Mary was there either.\n   b. If Sue was not at the wedding, then our initial statement doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Mary was present or not.\n4. Since we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information, let's consider another possibility: perhaps Mary was indeed at the wedding, but Sue chose not to attend. In this case, both statements would be true.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the provided information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
