            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, often called an if-then statement. It means that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, it would be a certainty that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. However, the second statement tells us that \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" which introduces some uncertainty about whether or not Mark actually bought the blue shirt.\n3. Given these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" The reason is that even if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark didn't buy the blue shirt (e.g., he changed his mind, there was no blue shirt available, etc.).\n\nAnswer: No.",
