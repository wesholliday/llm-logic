We also know that the mummy might not have been awake (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B, we cannot directly conclude whether the vampire was awake or not because statement A only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, but it doesn't tell us the opposite.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot definitively say 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
