We know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest as well (this is called a conditional statement).\n2. However, we also know that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This means there's a possibility that the unicorn was not present in the forest.\n3. If the unicorn could not be in the forest, then according to our conditional statement, the griffin cannot be in the forest either.\n4. But since we only know that the unicorn might not have been in the forest (not definitely wasn't), it doesn't necessarily mean that the griffin wasn't in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on these statements alone.",
