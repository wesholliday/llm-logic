            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The original premise states that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. This means that there is a causal relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm.\n2. The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise - that the pilot light is out.\n3. However, the truth of the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the truth of the premise. Even if we know that the oven being on causes the kitchen to be warm, it does not mean that this relationship holds when the pilot light is out.\n4. In fact, if the pilot light is out, the oven may not be able to produce heat and the kitchen may not be warm.\n5. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the truth of the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
