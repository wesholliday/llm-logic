The conclusion adds another condition to the premise, stating that if both the oil is changed and the transmission is shot, then the car will run smoothly.\n3. This form of argument introduces an additional condition (the transmission being shot) in the conclusion that was not present in the original premise.\n4. The truth of the original premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion because the condition added to the conclusion may affect whether the car runs smoothly or not.\n5. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid since it does not follow from the premise that if the oil is changed and the transmission is shot, then the car will run smoothly.\n\nAnswer: No.",
