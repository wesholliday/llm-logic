The original argument can be represented as follows:\n   Premise: P -> Q (if the car is in the garage, then it is safe)\n   Conclusion: (P ^ R) -> Q (if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe)\n\n2. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n   \n3. In this case, the original premise only tells us that if the car is in the garage, it is safe. It does not provide any information about what happens when additional conditions are present, such as a flooding garage.\n\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe' does not necessarily follow from the premise. The safety of the car in a flooded garage cannot be inferred based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
