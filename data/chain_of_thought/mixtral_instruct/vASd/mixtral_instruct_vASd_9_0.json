This means that there are no other factors considered in the premise, just the quality of the essay itself.\n2. However, the conclusion adds a new condition - turning in the essay late. It assumes that even with this additional factor, the student will still receive an A.\n3. But the information provided in the premise does not support this assumption because it only discusses the relationship between the quality of the essay and getting an A, without considering any other factors like tardiness.\n4. Therefore, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: No.",
