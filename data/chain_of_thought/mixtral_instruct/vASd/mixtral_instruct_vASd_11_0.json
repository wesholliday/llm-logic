            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The original argument is in the form \"If P, then Q\" as its premise and \"If P and R, then Q\" as its conclusion.\n2. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we can use a method called truth table analysis.\n3. We will create a truth table with three columns for P, R, and Q, and two rows for the possible combinations of true (T) and false (F).\n4. The premise \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"Not P or Q,\" which means that if P is false or Q is true, then the implication holds true.\n5. The conclusion \"If P and R, then Q\" is also logically equivalent to \"Not (P and R) or Q.\"\n6. Now we will create a truth table:\n\n| P | R | Q | Not P or Q | Not (P and R) or Q |\n|---|---|---|------------|-------------------|\n| T | T | T |   T       |      T            |\n| T | T | F |   F       |      T            |\n| T | F | T |   T       |      T            |\n| T | F | F |   F       |      T            |\n| F | T | T |   T       |      T            |\n| F | T | F |   T       |      T            |\n| F | F | T |   T       |      T            |\n| F | F | F |   T       |      T            |\n\n7. As we can see in the truth table, every time the premise is true, the conclusion is also true. This means that the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
