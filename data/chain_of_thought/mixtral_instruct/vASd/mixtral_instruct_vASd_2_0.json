This is a conditional statement where going to the concert is the antecedent and having a good time is the consequent.\n2. The conclusion extends this conditional statement by adding another condition - a bomb going off at the concert.\n3. However, even though the original premise might be true, the conclusion introduces an additional factor that negates the idea of having a good time.\n4. In other words, just because we would have a good time if only we went to the concert, it doesn't mean that adding a bomb going off would still result in us having a good time.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
