A logically valid argument must have a structure where if its premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that watering the plants leads to their growth. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - no sunlight. The truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion because even if the plants are watered, they might not grow without sunlight.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether the argument is logically valid or not.\nThe argument is not logically valid because the truth of its premises does not ensure the truth of its conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
