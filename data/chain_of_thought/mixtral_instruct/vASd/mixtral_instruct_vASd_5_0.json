The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise: (P ^ Q) -> S (if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue)\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. In this case, even if the check bounces (Q), as long as the bill is paid (P), the services will continue (S). The bounced check does not affect the continuation of services in this argument form.\n5. Therefore, the argument form is logically valid because the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
