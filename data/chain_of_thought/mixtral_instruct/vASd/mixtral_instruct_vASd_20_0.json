This is not necessarily true and depends on various factors such as the type of medication and how long it has been expired.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether the argument is logically valid or invalid.\nThe argument is logically invalid because it makes an unwarranted assumption about the effects of taking expired medication.\n\nAnswer: No.",
