The original argument's premise is \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run.\" This can be represented as P -> Q (where P represents filling up the gas tank and Q represents the car running).\n2. The conclusion of the modified argument is \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run.\" This can be represented as (P ^ R) -> Q (where R represents having a hole in the gas tank).\n3. In order for an argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises.\n4. However, if there is a hole in the gas tank (R), then even if it's filled up (P), fuel will leak out and the car won't run (not Q).\n5. Therefore, the conclusion (P ^ R) -> Q does not necessarily follow from the premise P -> Q, making this form of argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
