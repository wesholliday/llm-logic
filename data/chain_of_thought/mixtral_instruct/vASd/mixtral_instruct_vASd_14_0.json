The conclusion extends the premise to include an additional condition, namely that the test is in Chinese.\n3. However, the argument fails to establish a connection between studying hard and the test being in Chinese.\n4. Therefore, even if the original premise is true, the conclusion does not necessarily follow because it introduces a new condition without justification.\n5. Thus, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
