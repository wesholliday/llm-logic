            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The original conditional statement is \"If the match is struck, then it will light.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents striking the match and Q represents the match lighting.\n2. The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise: \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.\" This can be represented as (P ^ R) -> Q, where R represents the match being soaked in water.\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. In this case, even if the premise is true (that is, if striking the match always results in it lighting), adding an additional condition (the match being soaked in water) does not guarantee that the conclusion will be true. The match may still fail to light due to the added condition of being soaked in water.\n5. Therefore, the argument form is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
