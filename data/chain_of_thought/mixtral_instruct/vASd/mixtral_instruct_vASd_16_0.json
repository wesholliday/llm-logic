            "content": "Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. The original argument has the form \"If P, then Q\" as its premise and \"If P and R, then Q\" as its conclusion.\n2. To determine if this form is logically valid, we can use a method called truth table analysis.\n3. In a truth table, we list all possible combinations of true (T) and false (F) values for the propositions P, Q, and R.\n4. For the given argument, the truth table would look like this:\n\n| P | R | Q | If P, then Q | If P and R, then Q |\n|---|---|---|-------------|-------------------|\n| T | T | T |     T       |         T          |\n| T | T | F |     F       |         F          |\n| T | F | T |     T       |         T          |\n| T | F | F |     F       |         F          |\n| F | T | T |     T       |         X          |\n| F | T | F |     T       |         X          |\n| F | F | T |     T       |         X          |\n| F | F | F |     T       |         X          |\n\n5. In the truth table, \"X\" indicates that the conclusion is not a logical consequence of the premise(s).\n6. As we can see in the third row of the table, there is a possible combination of true and false values where the premise is true (P and R are both true), but the conclusion is false (Q is false).\n7. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because it does not guarantee that the conclusion must be true whenever the premise(s) are true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
