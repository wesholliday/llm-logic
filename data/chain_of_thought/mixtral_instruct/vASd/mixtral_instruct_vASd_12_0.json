The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise: If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, then I can play video games.\n3. To evaluate logical validity, we need to determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4. In this case, the original premise only states that finishing homework is a condition for playing video games, but it doesn't address any other conditions or exceptions.\n5. The added condition in the conclusion (my computer catches on fire) is not mentioned or implied in the premise.\n6. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
