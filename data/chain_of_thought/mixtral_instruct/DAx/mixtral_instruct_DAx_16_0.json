            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The first part of this statement is called the antecedent (the 'if' part), and the second part is called the consequent (the 'then' part).\n3. In this case, the antecedent is \"the sneg was crampled,\" and the consequent is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n4. We are also given that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n5. Since the antecedent is not true (because the sneg was not crampled), we cannot determine whether the consequent is true or false based on this information alone. This situation is called vacuous truth, where the conditional statement is technically true but practically meaningless because its hypothesis is false.\n6. Therefore, from \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg was not crampled,\" we cannot infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
