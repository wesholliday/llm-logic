            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We know that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked (this is given as 'If P, then Q').\n2. We also know that the splat was not morphed (given as 'not P').\n3. Now we want to find out if we can conclude that the splat did not quank (which is 'not Q').\n4. According to the principle of logical reasoning known as Modus Tollens, if 'If P, then Q' is true and 'not Q' is also true, then 'not P' must be true.\n5. In this case, 'P' stands for 'the splat was morphed', 'Q' stands for 'the splat quanked'. We know that 'not Q' (the splat did not quank) and we are asked if we can conclude 'not P' (the splat was not morphed).\n6. Since Modus Tollens applies here, we can indeed infer 'not P' from 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
