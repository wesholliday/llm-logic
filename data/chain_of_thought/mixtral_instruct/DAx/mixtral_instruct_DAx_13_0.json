We also know that the glip was not slogged (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged. However, statement B tells us that the glip was not slogged.\n4. Since the glip was not slogged, we cannot use statement A to determine whether the glip was tragged or not. \n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The glip was not tragged'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
