We know that 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second statement given is 'The smip was not shripped'.\n3. Given these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The smip did not lup the zoint'. This is because the first statement only tells us what would happen if the smip were shripped, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the smip is not shripped.\n4. In other words, just because the smip was not shripped, it doesn't necessarily mean that the smip did not lup the zoint. It could be the case that the smip lupped the zoint even if it wasn't shripped.\n\nAnswer: No.",
