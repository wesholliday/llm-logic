            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic.\n\n1. We are given two statements: (a) \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" and (b) \"The shank was not plooked\".\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\", where P represents \"the shank was plooked\" and Q represents \"the shank was nugged\".\n3. The second statement tells us that \"the shank was not plooked\", which means that P (the shank being plooked) is false.\n4. In evaluating the truth of a conditional statement, we can use the principle of Modus Ponens: if both P and \"if P, then Q\" are true, then Q must be true. However, in this case, we know that P is false.\n5. Another principle related to conditionals is Modus Tollens: if Q is false and \"if P, then Q\" is true, then P must be false. But again, we don't have enough information about the truth value of Q (the shank being nugged).\n6. Instead, what we are dealing with here is a concept called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". In other words, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then its premise must also be false.\n7. Since we know that the shank was not plooked (not P), and the given conditional statement tells us that if the shank were plooked (P), it would be nugged (Q), we can infer that the shank was not nugged (not Q). This is because, based on contrapositive reasoning, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false (the shank being nugged), then its premise must also be false (the shank being plooked).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
