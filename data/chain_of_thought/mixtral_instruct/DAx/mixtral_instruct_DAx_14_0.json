However, we are told that the clug was not fleeked (second statement).\n3. Since the clug wasn't fleeked, we cannot conclude whether or not it snugged based on the given information alone. The two statements do not provide enough information to definitively say whether the clug was or was not snugged when the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
