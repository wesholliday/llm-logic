We are also given that the sprocket was not cranked (let's call this statement B).\n3. Based on statement A, we cannot directly infer whether the sprocket was daggled or not when it is not cranked. This is because statement A only applies to the condition where the sprocket is cranked.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that the sprocket is not cranked (statement B), we cannot definitively conclude whether the sprocket was daggled or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
