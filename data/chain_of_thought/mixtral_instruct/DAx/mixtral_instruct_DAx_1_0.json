            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled (denoted as: Blimmed(flugel) -> Zargled(flugel)).\n2. We also know that the flugel was not blimmed (denoted as: ~Blimmed(flugel)).\n3. From these two statements, we want to infer whether or not the flugel was zargled (denoted as: Zargled(flugel) or ~Zargled(flugel)).\n4. Since the flugel was not blimmed, and blimming is a prerequisite for zargling (as stated in step 1), it follows that the flugel could not have been zargled.\n5. Therefore, we can indeed infer 'The flugel was not zargled' (denoted as: ~Zargled(flugel)).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
