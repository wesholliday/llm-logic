We are also told that the smonk was not vreebled.\n3. Since the smonk was not vreebled, we cannot apply the first statement to determine whether the smonk plagged or not.\n4. However, since the smonk was not vreebled, and the only condition under which it would have plagged is if it were vreebled, it follows that the smonk did not plag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
