We know that 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. \n2. The second statement given is 'The wug was not flooped'.\n3. Given these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The wug did not bim the zoint'. This is because the first statement only tells us what would happen if the wug were flooped, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the wug is not flooped.\n4. In other words, just because the wug wasn't flooped, it doesn't necessarily mean that it didn't bim the zoint. The two statements are not logically connected in a way that would allow us to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
