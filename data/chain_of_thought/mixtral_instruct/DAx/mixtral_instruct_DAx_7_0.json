We are also told that 'The whiffle was not shanked'. \n3. Given this information, we want to determine if we can infer that 'The whiffle did not tink'.\n4. To make this inference, we need to apply logical reasoning using the given statements. Specifically, we are looking for a situation where the condition (the whiffle being shanked) is not met, and therefore the consequence (the whiffle tinking) should also not occur.\n5. In this case, since 'The whiffle was not shanked', it follows that the condition of our first statement has not been met.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that 'The whiffle did not tink'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
