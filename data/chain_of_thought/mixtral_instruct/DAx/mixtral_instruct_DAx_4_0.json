We also know that the fribble was not snurgled (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked. However, statement B tells us that the fribble was not snurgled.\n4. Since the fribble was not snurgled, we cannot directly apply the implication from statement A to conclude whether or not the fribble crinked.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that 'The fribble did not crink.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
