We are given that the zinger was not fraggled (let's call this statement B).\n3. Based on statement A, if the zinger had been fraggled, then it would have been smoogled. However, since we know from statement B that the zinger was not fraggled, we cannot conclude whether or not the zinger is smoogled.\n4. In other words, just because the zinger isn't fraggled doesn't mean it can't be smoogled through some other means.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the zinger was not smoogled based on the given statements.",
