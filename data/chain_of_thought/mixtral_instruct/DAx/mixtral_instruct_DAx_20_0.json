In this case, having Q as true would contradict our conditional statement P \u2192 Q since its antecedent \u00acP is true but its consequent Q is false.\n\nSince having both \u00acP and Q would lead to a contradiction with the given conditional statement, we can conclude that if the fleeg was not bluttered (\u00acP), then it did not surn (\u00acQ).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
