    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": " Let's break down this problem step by step:\n1. We know that there are three teams: fraglen, darpil, and votal.\n2. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind.\n3. If the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will.\n4. It is likely that the fraglen will lead the league and therefore it is likely that the darpil won't.\n5. Now we need to determine if it's likely that, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will.\n6. Since the fraglen is expected to have the best record and it is likely that they will lead the league, it means that there is a chance they might not lead the league.\n7. If the fraglen doesn't lead the league, then based on point 3, the votal has a chance to have the top record if the darpil also fails to do so.\n8. However, we don't have enough information about the relative strength of the darpil and votal when the fraglen is not leading. It could be that even if the fraglen doesn't lead, the darpil still has a better chance of having the top record than the votal.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not necessarily follow that it's likely that, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will. We don't have enough information to determine the relative strength of the darpil and votal when the fraglen is not leading.",
