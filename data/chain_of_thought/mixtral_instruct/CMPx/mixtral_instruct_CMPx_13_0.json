    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The industry watchers consider the fantug as the front runner and believe it is likely to win Blither of the Year.\n2. If the loperit doesn't win, then either the fantug or the frallon will win.\n3. Since the fantug is more likely to win than the loperit, we can infer that if the loperit doesn't win, it increases the chances of the frallon winning.\n4. However, even though the fantug is more likely to win than the loperit, it does not necessarily mean that the frallon is more likely to win than the loperit if the fantug doesn't win.\n5. The information provided only tells us about the relative likelihood of the fantug and loperit winning, but it does not give any direct comparison between the fantug and frallon or the loperit and frallon.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon is likely to win.",
