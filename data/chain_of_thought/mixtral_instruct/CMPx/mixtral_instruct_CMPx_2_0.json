    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n1. We know that there are three applicants for one open zulision: a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect.\n2. The jantiz is considered the most qualified, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications.\n3. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't, the sulect will.\n4. We are asked if it's likely that, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nNow let's analyze the given information:\n- The jantiz is most likely to get the zulision due to being the most qualified.\n- If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then the sulect will if the jantiz also doesn't get it.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the likelihood of the sulect getting the zulision if the jantiz doesn't because we don't have enough information about how the decision-maker weighs the qualifications or makes their decisions. It could be that the decision-maker prefers the cramen over the sulect even though the jantiz is more qualified than both.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it's likely that if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will.",
