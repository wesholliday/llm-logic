    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

The experts believe the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, and then the peedonk has a much lower chance.\n2. If the beelhet doesn't become domer, and the garplex also doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer (since they are the only candidates).\n3. It is likely that the garplex will become domer, which implies it is likely that the beelhet won't become domer.\n4. Given that it is likely the beelhet won't become domer and there are no other candidates besides the garplex, peedonk, and beelhet, we can conclude that if the garplex doesn't become domer, then it is indeed likely that the peedonk will become domer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
