    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": " Let's break down the given information and reasoning step by step:\n1. The crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer.\n2. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn't either, the jomial will.\n3. The crastin is likely to lead births, and hence the nivet is likely not to.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to determine whether the given information supports the conclusion that the jomial is likely to lead births if the crastin doesn't.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that if neither the crastin nor the nivet leads in birthing, then the jomial will. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is *likely* for the jomial to lead births if the crastin doesn't. It only tells us that the jomial will lead births under specific circumstances (i.e., when neither the crastin nor the nivet leads).\n\nThe information provided does not give any indication of how likely or unlikely it is for the nivet to outbirth the crastin, which is crucial for determining whether it's likely that the jomial will lead births if the crastin doesn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that it follows that it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
