    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

If the dribban doesn't win the cup, and the fantole also doesn't win, then the snorpul will win.\n3. The fantole is likely to win the cup, which implies that the dribban is less likely to win.\n4. However, the information provided does not give us any indication about how likely or unlikely the fantole is to lose. It could still be relatively unlikely for the fantole to lose, even though it's more likely to lose than the dribban.\n5. Without knowing the exact probabilities, we cannot definitively say that it's likely the snorpul will win if the fantole doesn't.\n\nAnswer: No.",
