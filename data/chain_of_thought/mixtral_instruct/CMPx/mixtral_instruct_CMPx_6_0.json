    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

If the lomfry doesn't sell the most gardam, then the darsal will.\n3. The jentil is likely to lead gardam sales, implying that the lomfry is unlikely to lead.\n\nNow let's consider the possibility of the jentil not leading gardam sales:\n- Since the jentil is expected to sell more than the lomfry, if the jentil doesn't lead, then the lomfry won't either.\n- Given that the lomfry won't lead in gardam sales, it follows that the darsal will.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
