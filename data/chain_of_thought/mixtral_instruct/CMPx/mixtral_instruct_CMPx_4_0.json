    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n1. We know that the crinel is the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, and then the tomul.\n2. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then if the crinel also isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n3. The likelihood of the crinel being named snarggle is high, which means the likelihood of the nafiz being named snarggle is low.\n4. However, this information doesn't directly affect the likelihood of the tomul becoming snarggle if neither the crinel nor the nafiz are chosen.\n5. We don't have any information suggesting that the tomul has a higher or lower chance of being named snarggle in this specific scenario (crinel not being named snarggle).\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it is likely that if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be.",
