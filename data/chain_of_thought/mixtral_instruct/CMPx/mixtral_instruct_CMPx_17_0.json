    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": " Let's analyze this step by step:\n1. The talent scouts believe that the flinker is highly probable to have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen.\n2. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season (assuming no other prospects are considered).\n3. Scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season, which implies that they believe the dringen is less likely to have a breakout season.\n4. However, even if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it does not necessarily mean that the dringen won't either. It could still be possible for neither the flinker nor the dringen to have a breakout season.\n5. Only if both the flinker and the dringen don't have a breakout season would the n\u00fcffen have a chance at having one.\n\nBased on this information, it is not likely that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will. The likelihood of the n\u00fcffen having a breakout season depends on both the flinker and dringen failing to meet expectations.\n\nAnswer: No.",
