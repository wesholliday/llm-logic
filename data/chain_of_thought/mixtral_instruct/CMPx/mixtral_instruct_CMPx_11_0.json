    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

If the lanken doesn't win, then either the trenist or the draloid will win.\n3. The text states that if the trenist doesn't win, the draloid will win, but it does not necessarily mean this is likely to happen.\n4. The information given suggests that the trenist is likely to win and the lanken is less likely to win, but it does not provide any information about the likelihood of the draloid winning if the trenist doesn't win.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether it is likely or unlikely that the draloid will win if the trenist doesn't win Drij of the Year.\n\nAnswer: No.",
