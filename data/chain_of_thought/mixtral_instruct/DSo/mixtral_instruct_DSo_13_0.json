The second statement can be broken down into two parts: 'The toy is in the toy box' and 'The toy is sitting on the shelf'.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, we can eliminate that part of the second statement.\n4. This leaves us with only one possibility: 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
