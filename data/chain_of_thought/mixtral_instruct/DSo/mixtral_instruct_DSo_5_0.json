The first statement is \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\" This implies that if the cookies are anywhere, they must be somewhere other than the pantry.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\" This is a disjunction (an 'or' statement), which means one of its parts must be true.\n\nNow let's analyze these statements together:\n- Since we know from the first statement that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, it means the second statement reduces to \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n- Therefore, given both statements, we can indeed infer that 'The cookies are in the jar.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
