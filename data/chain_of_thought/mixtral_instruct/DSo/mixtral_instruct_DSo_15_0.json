The first statement is \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\" The second statement is \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\"\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze the second statement further. It's a disjunction (an 'or' statement), which means one of its parts must be true. In this case, if the first part \"the shoes are in the closet\" is true, then it satisfies the entire statement.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider the first statement again - \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\" This implies that they are somewhere else.\n\nStep 4: Given steps 2 and 3, if the shoes aren't lined up by the door (first statement), then they must be in the closet (the only other option presented in the second statement).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
