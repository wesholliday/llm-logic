The first statement is \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\" The second statement is \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\"\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze the given information and possible scenarios. Since we know from the first statement that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, we need to consider where else it could be.\n\nStep 3: The second statement provides us with two options for the location of the jacket: draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. However, since we already know that it's not hanging in the closet (from the first statement), only one option remains.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, based on the process of elimination and the given information, we can infer that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
