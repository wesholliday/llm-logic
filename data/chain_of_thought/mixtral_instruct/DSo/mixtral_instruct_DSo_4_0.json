We also know that 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom' (statement B).\n3. Statement B has two possibilities: a) The cat is napping on the couch, or b) The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n4. Since we have statement A which tells us that 'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom', option b from statement B cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from statement B is option a: 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
