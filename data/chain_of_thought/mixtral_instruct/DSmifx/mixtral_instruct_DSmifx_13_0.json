This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. The second statement we are given is \"The glip might not be tragged\". This implies that 'tragged' is not necessarily true for the glip.\n\n3. Given the first statement and the information that 'tragged' might not be true, it follows logically that 'slogged' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
