We also know that the fribble might not be crinked (let's call this statement B).\n\nNow let's analyze these statements:\n\n- Statement A gives us two possibilities for the fribble: being crinked or being snurgled.\n- Statement B tells us that there is a possibility that the fribble is not crinkled. This does not necessarily mean that the fribble is snurgled, as it could also mean that the fribble doesn't have any of the mentioned properties (crinked or snurgled).\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'. We can only say that it might be possible.\n\nAnswer: No.",
