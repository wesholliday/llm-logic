We also know that the whiffle might not be tinked (let's call this statement B).\n\nFrom statement B, we can infer that the whiffle may or may not be tinked. It doesn't necessarily mean that the whiffle is not tinked; it just means there's a possibility it isn't.\n\nHowever, statement A only tells us that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. It doesn't tell us that the whiffle cannot be tinked and still be shanked. \n\nSince we have a possibility that the whiffle might be tinked (from statement B), we can't definitively say that 'The whiffle is shanked'. \n\nAnswer: No.",
