We have the statement \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"The flob might not be movated.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated. \n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flob is skizzled. It could also mean that the flob is not in motion for some other reason.\n4. Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
