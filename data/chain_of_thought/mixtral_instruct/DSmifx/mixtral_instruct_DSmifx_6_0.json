The first statement presents us with two possibilities for the grommet: being plopped or being sploffed.\n3. The second statement tells us that there's a chance the grommet isn't plopped, which means it could still be in another state (not necessarily sploffed).\n4. However, since the first statement only gives us two possibilities and we know from the second statement that the grommet might not be plopped, then by process of elimination, if the grommet isn't plopped, it must be sploffed.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
