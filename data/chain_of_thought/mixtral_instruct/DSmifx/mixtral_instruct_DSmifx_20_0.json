We are also told that the fleeg might not be surned. This implies that being surned is not necessary for the fleeg.\n3. However, this does not give us any information about whether the fleeg is bluttered or not. The statement 'The fleeg might not be surned' does not negate the possibility of the fleeg being bluttered.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
