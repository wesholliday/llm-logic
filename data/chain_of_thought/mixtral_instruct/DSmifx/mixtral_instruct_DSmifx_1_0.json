We have the statement \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\" This means that at least one of these two conditions must hold true for the flugel: being zargled or being blimmed.\n2. Then we are given the information \"The flugel might not be zargled.\" This statement suggests that there's a possibility that the flugel is not in the zargled state.\n3. Since it's possible for the flugel to not be zargled, and since one of the two conditions mentioned in the first statement must hold true, we can infer that the other condition, \"it is blimmed,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
