We have the statement \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. We also have the statement \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n3. To infer \"The splat is morphed\" from these two statements, we would need to establish that the only other option besides quanking the splat is morphing it. \n4. However, the given information does not explicitly rule out other possibilities for the splat. For example, it could also be that the splat is neither quanked nor morphed, but instead ignored or removed in some other way.\n5. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively infer \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
