We know that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was also smoogled (from \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\").\n2. However, we are told that the zinger was not smoogled.\n3. If the zinger being not smoogled is true, then based on our first point, it cannot be the case that the zinger was fraggled.\n4. Therefore, from \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and \"The zinger was not smoogled\", we can indeed infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
