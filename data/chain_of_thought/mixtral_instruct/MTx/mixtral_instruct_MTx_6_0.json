We have two statements: (A) \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" and (B) \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n2. From statement B, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n3. According to statement A, if the grommet was sploffed, then it would have plopped the frink. However, since we know from statement B that the grommet did not plop the frink, this implies that the grommet was not sploffed.\n4. To summarize, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The grommet was not sploffed.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
