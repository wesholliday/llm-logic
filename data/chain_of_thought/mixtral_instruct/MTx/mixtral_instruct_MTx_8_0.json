We are given a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the sprocket was cranked' and Q represents 'the sprocket was daggled.'\n2. We are also told that 'the sprocket was not daggled,' which is represented as ~Q.\n3. Now we want to find out if we can infer 'the sprocket was not cranked,' represented as ~P.\n4. Using the contrapositive of the given conditional statement, we know that (~Q) -> (~P). This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it was not cranked.\n5. Since we are told that 'the sprocket was not daggled' (~Q), and we have established that (~Q) -> (~P), we can now infer that 'the sprocket was not cranked' (~P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
