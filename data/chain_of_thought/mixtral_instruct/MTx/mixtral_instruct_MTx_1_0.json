Given statement: If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled (denoted as P -> Q)\n2. Given statement: The flugel was not zargled (denoted as ~Q)\n3. We want to find out if we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed (denoted as ~P)\n4. To do this, let's use Modus Tollens, a valid form of logical reasoning:\n   - If P -> Q and ~Q, then ~P\n5. In our case, P represents 'The flugel was blimmed', and Q represents 'The flugel was zargled'.\n6. Since the given statements match the structure of Modus Tollens, we can indeed infer that:\n   - The flugel was not blimmed (~P)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
