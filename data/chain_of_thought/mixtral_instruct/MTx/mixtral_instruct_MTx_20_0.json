(We can write this as P -> Q, where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned\")\n2. The fleeg did not surn. (This can be written as ~Q)\n\nNow we want to find out if we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered (~P). To do this, let's use a truth table or apply logical reasoning:\n\n1. We know that Q is false because \"the fleeg did not surn\".\n2. If Q is false and P -> Q is true, then P must be false as well. This is based on the principle of contrapositive in logic.\n3. Therefore, since P (the fleeg was bluttered) is false, we can indeed infer that ~P (the fleeg was not bluttered).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
