            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given statements.\n- Statement A: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled.\" This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\". Here, P represents 'the wug was sproinged', and Q represents 'it was garbled'.\n- Statement B: \"The wug was not garbled.\" This is a negation of the statement 'the wug was garbled'.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the given statements.\n- To determine if we can infer that 'the wug was not sproinged', let's examine the given conditional statement (A) and see what it tells us about the relationship between 'sproinged' and 'garbled'.\n- The conditional statement A implies that if a wug was sproinged, then it must have been garbled. However, Statement B tells us that the wug was not garbled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the given statements and their relationship.\n- Since the wug was not garbled (Statement B), and being sproinged implies garbling (Statement A), it follows that the wug could not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
