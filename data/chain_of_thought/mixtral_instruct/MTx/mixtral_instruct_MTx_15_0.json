            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic:\n1. We are given two statements: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" and \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\". In this case, P represents \"the dreb was vroombed,\" and Q represents \"the dreb was spened.\"\n3. The second statement directly negates Q, stating that \"the dreb was not spened.\"\n4. To determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (which is the negation of P), let's consider what would happen if P were true. If the dreb was vroombed, then according to the first statement, it should have been spened. However, we know from the second statement that it was not spened.\n5. This contradiction indicates that P cannot be true; in other words, the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
