We also know that the splat did not quank (this is given as 'not Q').\n3. Now we want to find out if we can conclude that the splat was not morphed (this is 'not P').\n4. According to logic, if 'P implies Q' and 'not Q', then we can infer 'not P'. This is known as Modus Tollens.\n5. So in this case, since the splat quanking (Q) follows from the splat being morphed (P), and we know that the splat did not quank (not Q), we can indeed conclude that the splat was not morphed (not P).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
