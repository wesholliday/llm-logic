            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg did not sprotet the frink.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it sprouted the frink. However, it does not tell us whether the sneg was actually crampled or not.\n3. The second statement tells us that the sneg did not sprotet the frink. This means that the condition in the first statement was not met, because if the sneg had sprouted the frink, then it would have been crampled.\n4. Since we know from the second statement that the sneg did not sprotet the frink, and the first statement tells us that if the sneg had sprouted the frink, then it would have been crampled, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
