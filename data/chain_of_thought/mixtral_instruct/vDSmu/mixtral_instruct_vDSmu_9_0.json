This is an example of a disjunction, which means 'either...or'.\n2. The second premise negates one of those options by stating that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n3. Given these two premises, if we accept them as true, then there is only one option left for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it must be in the box.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If both options have been exhausted and one alternative remains, that remaining alternative becomes the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
