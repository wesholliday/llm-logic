This is an example of a disjunction, which means 'either...or'.\n2. The second premise negates the second option presented in the first premise, stating that it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n3. Given these two premises, the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
