The second premise negates the second option from the first premise, stating that it's not the case that the pen must be on the desk.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that the pen is in the bag.\n4. Thus, the conclusion logically follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
