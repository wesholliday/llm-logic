The first premise presents two mutually exclusive options for the location of the watch, either it's charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. The second premise negates the second option, stating that it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist.\n3. Therefore, if we accept both premises as true, then there is only one remaining option for the location of the watch - it must be charging on the dresser.\n4. This form of argument follows a structure known as disjunctive syllogism, which is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
