This is a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-Q\nConclusion: Therefore, P\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical validity of the argument form. In this case, if either P or Q is true and it is not the case that Q is true, then P must be true. This is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nStep 3: Check whether the given argument fits this valid form. The first premise corresponds to P or Q, the second premise corresponds to Not-Q, and the conclusion corresponds to P. Therefore, the given argument follows the logically valid disjunctive syllogism form.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
