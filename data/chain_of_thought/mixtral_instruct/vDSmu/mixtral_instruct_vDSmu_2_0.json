The second premise negates one of those options, stating that the book is not required to be on the table.\n3. Therefore, if neither option includes a necessity clause (i.e., 'must'), then by eliminating the second option (book being on the table), only the first option remains as a possibility.\n4. So, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: If the book is not required to be on the table and it can either be on the shelf or on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
