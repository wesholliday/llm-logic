The second premise negates one of those options: 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.'\n3. Given the law of non-contradiction, if it's not true that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then it must be somewhere else.\n4. According to the first premise, if it's not chilling in the fridge, then the only other option is that 'the milk is on the counter.'\n5. Therefore, based on the two premises and the laws of logic, we can infer that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
