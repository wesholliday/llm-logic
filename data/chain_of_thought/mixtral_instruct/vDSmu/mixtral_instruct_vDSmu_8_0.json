This is an example of a disjunction, which means that one (and only one) of these possibilities must be true.\n2. The second premise denies the possibility that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. \n3. Given the first and second premises, if it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then the only remaining possibility is that it's on the coffee table.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: if neither of the two possibilities presented in the first premise is denied, and one possibility is denied in the second premise, then the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
