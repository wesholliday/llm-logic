This is a disjunction, represented as P v Q.\n2. The second premise negates the second option from the first premise, meaning the jacket cannot be found hanging in the closet. This is represented as ~Q.\n3. The conclusion then states that the jacket must be draped over the chair. This is represented as P.\n4. Given the two premises, if the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet (~Q), and the only options are being draped over the chair or hanging in the closet (P v Q), it logically follows that the jacket must be draped over the chair (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
