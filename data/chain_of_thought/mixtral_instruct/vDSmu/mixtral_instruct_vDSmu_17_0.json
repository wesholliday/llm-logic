This is an example of a disjunction, which means 'or'.\n2. The second premise denies that the scarf must be on the coat rack. \n3. From these two premises, we can infer that if the scarf isn't required to be on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack (because those were the only two options presented).\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
