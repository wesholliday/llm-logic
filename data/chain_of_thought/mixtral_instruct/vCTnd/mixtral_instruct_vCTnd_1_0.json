The given premise is \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This can be written in logical notation as P -> ~Q, where P represents \"it's raining\" and Q represents \"it's raining hard.\"\n2. The conclusion is \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" which can be written in logical notation as Q -> ~P.\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4. However, in this case, the premise and conclusion are not logically equivalent or related in a way that would make the conclusion follow from the premise.\n5. For example, it could be raining moderately (neither hard nor light), which would satisfy neither the premise nor the conclusion.\n6. Therefore, the argument form is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
