According to the premise, if the meal was prepared, it could not have been prepared carefully. Therefore, the assumption that the meal was prepared carefully leads to a contradiction with the given premise.\n- Since assuming the truth of the premise prevents us from accepting the conclusion as true, this form of argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
