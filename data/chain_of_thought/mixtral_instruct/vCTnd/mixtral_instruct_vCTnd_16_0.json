This contradicts our initial assumption that the job was completed well (from the conclusion).\n\nStep 5: Determine if the argument is valid or not based on the test in step 4.\n- Since assuming the premise leads to a contradiction with the conclusion, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
