However, this contradicts our assumption from the premise, which states that washing the clothes will always result in them being washed improperly.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the argument is logically valid or not.\nSince the conclusion cannot be true given the truth of the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
