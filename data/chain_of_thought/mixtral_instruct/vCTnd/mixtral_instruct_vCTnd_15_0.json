This means that there is no scenario where the room can be both tidied and tidied thoroughly according to the given information.\n2. The conclusion states that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. This implies that there is no situation where the room can be both tidied thoroughly and also tidied.\n3. However, this contradicts our understanding of what it means to tidy a room and tidy it thoroughly. Tidying a room should imply that it has been tidied thoroughly as well.\n4. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion does not follow from its premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
