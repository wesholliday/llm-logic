This means that serving and being served promptly are mutually exclusive events in this context.\n2. The conclusion states that if the customer was served promptly, then they were not served at all. However, this is a different scenario from what was presented in the premise.\n3. In the premise, it's possible for the customer to be served (though not promptly), but in the conclusion, there's no possibility of being served at all if served promptly.\n4. Therefore, the argument does not follow logically because the conclusion contradicts the information provided in the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
