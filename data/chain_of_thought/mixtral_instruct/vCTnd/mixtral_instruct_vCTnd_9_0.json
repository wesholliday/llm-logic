The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the premise can be rewritten as \"If instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given\" (not instructions were given implies instructions were not explained clearly).\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nYes, the argument is logically valid because it follows the structure of a contrapositive statement, which is always true when the original conditional statement is true. However, note that this argument may not be factually correct or meaningful depending on the context.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
