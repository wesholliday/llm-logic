In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\nStep 4: Perform a counterexample test.\nA common way to test for logical validity is by trying to find a counterexample\u2014a situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. If such a scenario exists, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nStep 5: Examine the given premise and conclusion for possible counterexamples.\nConsider the following scenario:\n- R = A professor recommended a student for an internship (recommendation made)\n- S = The recommendation was strong (strong recommendation)\n\nIn this case, both the premise and the conclusion cannot be true simultaneously. If the professor made a recommendation (R is true), then it cannot be a strong recommendation (S is false). On the other hand, if the recommendation was strong (S is true), then a recommendation was indeed made (R is true).\n\nStep 6: Conclusion on logical validity.\nSince no counterexample can be found where the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
