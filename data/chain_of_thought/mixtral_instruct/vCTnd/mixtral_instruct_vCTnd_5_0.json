            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\nConclusion: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure of the argument.\n- The premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q) where P represents 'the room was cleaned' and Q represents 'it was not cleaned thoroughly'.\n- The conclusion is also a conditional statement (if R, then S) where R represents 'the room was cleaned thoroughly' and S represents 'it was not cleaned'.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument follows the rules of logical validity.\n- To check for logical validity, we can use a technique called counterexample testing. We assume that the premise is true and see if the conclusion must necessarily be true as well.\n- In this case, let's assume the premise is true: If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This means that there are still some areas left uncleaned or not properly taken care of even after cleaning.\n- Now, consider the conclusion: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. However, this statement contradicts our assumption that the room was cleaned (even if not thoroughly). Therefore, the conclusion cannot be true given the truth of the premise.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether the argument is logically valid or not.\n- Since the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
