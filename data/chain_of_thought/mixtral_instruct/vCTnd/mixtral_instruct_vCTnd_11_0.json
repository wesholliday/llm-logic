            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The given premise is \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\". In this case, P represents \"I went to the store\" and Q represents \"I did not buy vegetables.\"\n2. The conclusion is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store,\" which can be rewritten as \"If Q, then not P.\"\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4. In this case, the given premise states that going to the store implies not buying vegetables (P -> Q). The conclusion then asserts that buying vegetables implies not going to the store (Q -> not P).\n5. However, these two statements are not logically equivalent because they do not share the same antecedent and consequent.\n6. Therefore, the argument form is not logically valid since the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
