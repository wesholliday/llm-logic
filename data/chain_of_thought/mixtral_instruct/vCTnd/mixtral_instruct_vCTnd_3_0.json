The conclusion is \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal,\" which can be rewritten as \"Not (I ate a large meal and I ate a meal).\"\n3. Comparing the premise and conclusion, we see that they have the same structure: two statements connected by 'and' are negated.\n4. However, the order of the statements is different between the premise and conclusion. In the premise, \"meal\" comes before \"large meal,\" while in the conclusion, \"large meal\" comes first.\n5. Swapping the order of the statements does not preserve logical validity because it changes the meaning of the statement.\n6. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
