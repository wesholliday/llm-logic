This means that the two statements \"Ann exercised\" and \"Ann exercised strenuously\" cannot both be true at the same time.\n2. The conclusion states that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. This means that the two statements \"Ann exercised strenuously\" and \"Ann did not exercise\" must be true at the same time.\n3. However, this is a contradiction with the premise. If \"Ann exercised strenuously\" implies \"Ann did not exercise\", then it cannot also be true that if \"Ann exercised\", then \"Ann did not exercise strenuously\".\n4. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion cannot be true given its premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
