The contrapositive of a conditional statement (if P, then Q) is formed by negating both parts and swapping them (if not Q, then not P).\n\nStep 3: Apply the contrapositive rule to the premise.\nThe contrapositive of the premise would be 'If Ben did not study diligently, then he did not study.'\n\nStep 4: Compare the result with the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,' which contradicts the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: No, this form of argument is not logically valid because its conclusion contradicts the contrapositive of its premise.",
