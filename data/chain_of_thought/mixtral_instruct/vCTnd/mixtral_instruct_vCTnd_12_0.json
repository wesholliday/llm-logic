We assume that the premise is true and see if the conclusion must also be true based on the information given in the premise.\n- Let's consider two cases:\n  a) Jane studied but not long. This satisfies the premise (if she studied, then she did not study long). However, it does not necessarily mean that if she studied long, she would not have studied at all. So, the conclusion is not following from the premise in this case.\n  b) Jane did not study. In this case, both the premise and the conclusion are vacuously true because their antecedents (if-clauses) are false. But again, this does not show that the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince there is a possible scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
