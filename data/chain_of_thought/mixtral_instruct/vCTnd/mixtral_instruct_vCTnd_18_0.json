The given premise is \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" This can be represented as P -> ~D (where P represents 'the issue was discussed' and D represents 'it was discussed in depth').\n2. The conclusion is \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" This can be represented as D -> ~P.\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the given premise implies the conclusion.\n4. However, in this case, the premise and conclusion contradict each other. If P -> ~D is true, then ~D -> ~P would be the logically equivalent contrapositive statement, not D -> ~P.\n5. Therefore, the argument form is not logically valid because its conclusion does not follow from its premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
