We also know that the glip might not have tragged (let's call this statement B).\n\nNow let's consider two scenarios based on these statements:\n\nScenario 1: If the glip was slogged, then according to statement A, it must have tragged. However, statement B tells us that the glip might not have tragged. This creates a contradiction because if the glip was slogged, it should have tragged, but statement B suggests otherwise.\n\nScenario 2: If the glip did not trag (contradicting statement A), then it could not have been slogged, which resolves the contradiction from Scenario 1. This scenario is consistent with both statements A and B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The glip was not slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
