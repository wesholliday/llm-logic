We are given the conditional statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This is also known as a material implication, which means that if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must be true as well.\n2. Next, we are told \"The twonk might not have been varnished,\" which suggests that the consequent of our conditional statement could be false.\n3. If the consequent is indeed false, and the conditional statement is a material implication, then according to the rules of logic, the antecedent must also be false.\n4. Therefore, since \"The twonk might not have been varnished,\" we can infer that \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
