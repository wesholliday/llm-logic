However, we also know that the flug might not have been zimmed (not q).\n3. From these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the flug was not blummed because there is still a possibility that the flug was zimmed but we don't know for sure.\n4. Therefore, based on this information alone, we cannot make the inference 'The flug was not blummed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
