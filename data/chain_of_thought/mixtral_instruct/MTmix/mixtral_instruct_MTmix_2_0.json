We are also told that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint (let's call this statement B).\n3. Statement B does not necessarily mean that the wug did not bim the zoint; it only means there is a possibility that it didn't.\n4. However, if the wug was indeed flooped (as stated in A), then it must have bimmed the zoint, which contradicts the possibility mentioned in statement B.\n5. Therefore, based on statements A and B, we cannot infer that 'The wug was not flooped'. Instead, we can only conclude that either the wug was not flooped or it didn't bim the zoint (or both).\n\nAnswer: No.",
