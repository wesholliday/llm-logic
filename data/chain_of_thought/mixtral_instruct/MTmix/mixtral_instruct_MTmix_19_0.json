We also know that the smonk might not have plagged (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then it cannot be true that the smonk did not plag.\n4. Statement B tells us exactly that: the smonk might not have plagged.\n5. Therefore, since statement B is possible (i.e., the smonk might not have plagged), this means that statement A cannot be true in all cases.\n6. In other words, if the smonk might not have plagged, then it's possible that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not vreebled'. The given information only suggests that it is possible for the smonk to be not vreebled.",
