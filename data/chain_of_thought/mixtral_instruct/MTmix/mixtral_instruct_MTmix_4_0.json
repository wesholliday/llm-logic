We also know that the fribble might not have crinked (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled and did not crinkle, then it would be a contradiction since snurgling implies crinkling.\n4. Statement B tells us that there is a possibility that the fribble did not crinkle.\n5. If the fribble might not have crinked (B), then it's possible for the fribble to be unsnurgled, which means the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
