We also know that the clug might not have been snugged (let's call this statement B).\n\nNow let's analyze these two statements:\n\n- Statement A tells us that fleeking implies snugging, but it doesn't necessarily mean that snugging implies fleeking. So, if the clug wasn't snugged, we cannot conclude for sure that it wasn't fleeked.\n- Statement B indicates a possibility of non-snugging, which further supports our previous point that not being snugged doesn't guarantee non-fleeking.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements alone, we cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
