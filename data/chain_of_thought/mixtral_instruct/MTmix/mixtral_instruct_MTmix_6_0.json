We also know that the grommet might not have plopped the frink (let's call this statement B).\n3. Statement B does not necessarily mean that the grommet was not sploffed, as there could be other reasons why it didn't plop the frink even if it was sploffed.\n4. However, since statement A tells us that the grommet being sploffed implies that it must have plopped the frink, and statement B contradicts this implication, we cannot infer that 'The grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
