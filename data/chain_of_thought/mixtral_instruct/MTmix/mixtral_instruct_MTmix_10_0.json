            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and reasoning step by step:\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garbled.\" This can be represented as: Sproinged -> Garbled\n2. Next, we are told that \"It might not have been garbled,\" which means there is a possibility that the wug was not garbled: ~Garbled\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" (~Sproinged) based on this information.\n4. From the given conditional statement, we know that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garbled. However, since there is a possibility that the wug was not garbled (~Garbled), this contradicts the conditional statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" (~Sproinged).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
