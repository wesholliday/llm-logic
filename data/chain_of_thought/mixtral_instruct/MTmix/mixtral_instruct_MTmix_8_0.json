We also know that the sprocket might not have been daggled (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B, we cannot directly conclude that the sprocket was not cranked because statement A tells us that if it were cranked, it would be daggled. However, it is possible that the sprocket was not cranked at all, which could explain why it might not have been daggled.\n4. But we cannot definitively conclude 'The sprocket was not cranked' based on these two statements alone because there is still a possibility that the sprocket was both cranked and then stopped being daggled due to some other factors not mentioned in the given information.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from these two statements alone.",
