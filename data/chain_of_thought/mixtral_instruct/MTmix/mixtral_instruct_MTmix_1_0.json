We also know that the flugel might not have been zargled (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it could not have not been zargled.\n4. However, statement B tells us that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled.\n5. If the flugel was not zargled, then according to statement A, it cannot be blimmed either.\n6. Therefore, based on statements A and B, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
