We know that \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\" This is a conditional statement, often written as \"Plooked(shank) -> Nugged(shank).\"\n2. We also know that \"The shank might not have been nugged,\" which means it's possible that Nugged(shank) is false.\n3. If Nugged(shank) is false, then according to the conditional statement in step 1, Plooked(shank) must be false as well.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
