This is a conditional statement where the condition (the doll being plastic) leads to a consequence (the truck must have been metal).\n2. The second premise denies the consequence of the first premise by stating that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n3. Logically, if the consequence is denied, then the condition cannot be true either due to the nature of conditional statements (if A, then B). If B is false, then A must also be false for the statement to hold true.\n4. Therefore, since the second premise denies the consequence in the first premise, it follows that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
