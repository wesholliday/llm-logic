This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This can be rephrased as \"not-Q\" (it is not true that Q).\n3. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race, which is the negation of P (\"not-P\").\n4. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n5. If the second premise is true (it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race), then the first premise tells us that Alex finishing the race (P) cannot be true because otherwise, Chris would have had to finish the race (Q).\n6. Therefore, if the two premises are true, the conclusion logically follows: Alex did not finish the race (not-P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
