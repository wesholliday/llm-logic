            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. The second premise negates the conclusion of this conditional statement. It asserts that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n3. Given these two premises, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park because if he had, then according to the first premise, Lucy would have had to go to the zoo, which contradicts the second premise.\n4. Therefore, since both premises cannot be true at the same time, and accepting the second premise as true leads us to a contradiction with the first premise, we must conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid. It follows the rules of logical inference known as Modus Tollens.",
