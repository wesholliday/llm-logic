This can be represented as \"Shirt = Cotton -> Pants = Denim\".\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This can be represented as \"~(Pants = Denim)\".\n3. We want to determine if the conclusion, \"The shirt was not cotton\" or \"Shirt \u2260 Cotton\", follows logically from these premises.\n4. To test for logical validity, we assume that the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true.\n5. If the shirt being cotton implies that the pants must be denim, then it stands to reason that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n6. Therefore, given these premises, the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" does logically follow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
