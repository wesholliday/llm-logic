            "content": "Step 1: Identify the logical structure of the argument. The argument appears to follow the form of modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: Not-B\nC: Therefore, not-A\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as follows:\n\nP1: If 'the book was written by James', then 'the book must be a mystery novel'\nP2: It's not the case that 'the book must be a mystery novel'\nC: Therefore, it's not the case that 'the book was written by James'\n\nStep 2: Analyze whether the argument follows the structure of modus tollens. To check for validity, we can use a truth table or apply the rules of inference directly. In this case, let's use the rules of inference.\n\nAssume the first premise is true (P1: A -> B). If the second premise is also true (P2: Not-B), then it means that B cannot be true. Since A implies B (A -> B), and B is false, this means that A must be false as well to maintain consistency. Therefore, the conclusion (C: Not-A) follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether the argument is valid or not. The argument follows the structure of modus tollens and satisfies the conditions for a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
