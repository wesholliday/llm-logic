The second premise denies that Sue's presence is necessary, meaning she could not have been required to be at the wedding.\n3. If Sue's presence is not necessary, then the condition stated in the first premise cannot be met because the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) cannot be true without violating the information given in the second premise.\n4. Therefore, based on the given premises, it is logically valid to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
