The second premise denies the necessity of Kate eating salad. In other words, it asserts that it's not the case that 'Kate must have eaten salad'. This can be translated to 'not-Q'.\n3. Now let's analyze the conclusion: 'Ben did not eat pasta', which is equivalent to 'not-P'.\n4. Given the premises, if Ben didn't eat pasta (not-P), then it wouldn't contradict that Kate didn't must have eaten salad (not-Q). Similarly, if Ben ate pasta (P), it would require Kate to must have eaten salad (Q), which contradicts our second premise (not-Q).\n5. Therefore, based on the given premises, we can logically infer that Ben did not eat pasta (not-P).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
