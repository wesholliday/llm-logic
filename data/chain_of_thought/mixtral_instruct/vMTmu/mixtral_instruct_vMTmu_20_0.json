The second premise negates the consequent of that conditional statement (not-B).\n3. The conclusion asserts the negation of the antecedent (not-A).\n4. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens in classical logic.\n5. If both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n6. Therefore, if 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' and 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', it logically follows that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
