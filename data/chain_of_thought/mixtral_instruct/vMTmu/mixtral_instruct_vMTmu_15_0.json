            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This can be represented as \"Sam took a plane -> Erin must have taken a train\".\n2. The second premise negates the conclusion of the conditional statement in the first premise, stating that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This can be represented as \"~(Erin must have taken a train)\".\n3. To evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use Modus Tollens, which states that if P -> Q and ~Q, then ~P.\n4. In this case, P is 'Sam took a plane', Q is 'Erin must have taken a train', and ~Q is 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train'.\n5. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, if Sam took a plane -> Erin must have taken a train and it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train, then it follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
