This is a conditional statement where P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat must have been outside.\"\n2. The second premise negates Q, stating it's not the case that \"the cat must have been outside.\"\n3. The conclusion asserts that P is false, meaning \"the dog was not inside.\"\n4. However, this argument form does not ensure the truth of its conclusion based on its premises. It commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n5. Even if Q is false (the cat wasn't outside), it doesn't necessarily mean P is false (the dog wasn't inside). There could be other possibilities, such as both being outside or indoors together.\n\nAnswer: No.",
