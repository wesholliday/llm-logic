            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This can be represented as \"Vampire awake -> Mummy awake\".\n2. The second premise denies that the mummy had to be awake, which is equivalent to saying \"not (Mummy awake)\".\n3. Now let's consider the conclusion: \"The vampire was not awake\", or \"not (Vampire awake)\".\n4. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n5. If the mummy didn't have to be awake, then it's possible that the vampire wasn't awake either, because there's no direct connection between them in the premises.\n6. However, the first premise does establish a conditional relationship: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n7. Since we know from the second premise that the mummy didn't have to be awake, it means the vampire couldn't have been awake either, because if he were, the mummy would also have to be awake according to the first premise.\n8. Therefore, the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
