The second premise denies the consequent of the first premise, stating that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (~B).\n3. To evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use Modus Tollens: if P -> Q and ~Q, then ~P.\n4. In our given argument, C corresponds to P, B corresponds to Q, and thus ~B corresponds to ~Q.\n5. Therefore, applying Modus Tollens, if the cake was chocolate (C) leads to a contradiction with the second premise (~B), we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (~C).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
