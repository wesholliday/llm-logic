            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This negates the consequent of our first premise and can be written as \"not Q\".\n3. Now we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from these two premises. The conclusion is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', which is the negation of the antecedent in our first premise, denoted as \"not P\".\n4. In this case, the argument follows the form of logical reasoning known as Modus Tollens (MT), where the structure is \"if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P\". \n5. Since MT is a valid form of deductive reasoning, if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
