            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement where the car being red is the antecedent and the truck having to be blue is the consequent.\n2. The second premise negates the idea that the truck must have been blue. \n3. Given this information, we can infer that the truck was not necessarily blue.\n4. However, the first premise only tells us what would happen if the car were red; it doesn't tell us whether or not the car actually is red.\n5. Without knowing whether or not the car is red, we cannot definitively say whether the argument's conclusion - 'The car was not red' - is true or false.\n6. The argument form itself, though, where the negation of a consequent leads to the negation of an antecedent in a conditional statement, is logically valid. This is known as Modus Tollens in formal logic.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument form is logically valid, but we cannot determine whether its conclusion is true or false based on the given premises alone.",
