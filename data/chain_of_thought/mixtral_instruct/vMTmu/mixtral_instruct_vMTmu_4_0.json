This can be represented as \"alien visited Mars -> robot visited Jupiter\".\n2. The second premise denies that the robot must have visited Jupiter, which means the robot did not visit Jupiter. This can be represented as \"not (robot visited Jupiter)\".\n3. Now let's apply Modus Tollens to these premises:\n   - If P -> Q and not Q, then not P.\n   - Here, P is 'alien visited Mars', and Q is 'robot visited Jupiter'.\n   - So, applying Modus Tollens, if 'alien visited Mars' implies 'robot visited Jupiter', and it's not the case that 'robot visited Jupiter', then it must be that 'alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
