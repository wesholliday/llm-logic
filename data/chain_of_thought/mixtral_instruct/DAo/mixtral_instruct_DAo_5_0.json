Our second piece of information is a conditional statement: 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n3. Since we know that Jeff did not play basketball, the condition in the second statement is not met.\n4. Therefore, based on the logic of contrapositives, if the condition is not met, then the conclusion of the conditional statement ('Amy played tennis') cannot be true.\n5. Thus, since we know that Amy did not play tennis under these circumstances, we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
