The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n3. Since the first part of the condition ('Mary was at the wedding') is false, the whole conditional statement is technically true according to the rules of logic (because if the premise is false, the conclusion can be either true or false and the statement would still be considered true).\n4. However, this doesn't allow us to infer 'Sue was not at the wedding'. The given information only tells us that if Mary had been at the wedding, Sue would have been there too. But since we know Mary wasn't there, the truth or falsehood of Sue's presence remains undetermined based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
