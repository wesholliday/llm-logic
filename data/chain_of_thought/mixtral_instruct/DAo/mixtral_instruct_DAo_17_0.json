The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'.\n3. Since Ben didn't eat pasta, the condition in the second statement is false.\n4. In logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement becomes true regardless of whether the conclusion (Kate ate salad) is true or false.\n5. Therefore, since the second statement is true, we cannot infer that 'Kate did not eat salad'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
