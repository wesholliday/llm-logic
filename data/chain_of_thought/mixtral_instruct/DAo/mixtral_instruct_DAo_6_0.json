Since Sue did not choose pizza, the condition of the second statement is false.\n4. In logic, when the condition of an 'if-then' statement is false, the entire statement becomes true regardless of whether the conclusion (Bob chose pasta) is actually true or not.\n5. Therefore, even though we don't know whether Bob really chose pasta or not, based on the given information, we can say that the second statement is true.\n6. However, this does not allow us to infer 'Bob did not choose pasta'. We only know that Sue didn't choose pizza and the implication about Bob choosing pasta if Sue had chosen pizza is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
