The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (Joe going to the park) is met.\n3. However, since we know that Joe did not go to the park, this condition is not met.\n4. Therefore, the second statement does not help us determine whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n5. We cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
