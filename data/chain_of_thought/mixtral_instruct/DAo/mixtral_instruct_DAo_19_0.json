The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n3. Since we know that Tom did not watch football, the condition in the second statement is not met.\n4. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Jen watched basketball based on this information alone.\n5. In other words, just because Tom didn't watch football doesn't necessarily mean Jen didn't watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
