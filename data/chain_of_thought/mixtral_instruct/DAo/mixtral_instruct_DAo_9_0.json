The second statement says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n3. Since we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the condition of the second statement is false.\n4. In logic, when the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is false, the entire statement becomes true regardless of whether the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true or false.\n5. Therefore, since the second statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt; he might have bought it for some other reason unrelated to Lisa's purchase.\n\nAnswer: No.",
