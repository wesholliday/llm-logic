And we have the conditional statement: 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n3. To determine if we can infer 'The wolf was not in the den', let's first consider what the given conditional statement means. It tells us that the presence of the bear in the cave is a sufficient condition for the wolf being in the den. However, it does not tell us anything about the necessary condition.\n4. Since we know that 'The bear was not in the cave', based on our conditional statement alone, we cannot make any conclusions about the location of the wolf. The truth value of 'The wolf was in the den' is independent of the given information about the bear and the cave.\n\nAnswer: No.",
