And we have the conditional statement: 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n3. To determine if we can infer 'The cat was not outside', let's first consider whether the cat could be outside based on these statements.\n4. Since the dog is not inside, it doesn't necessarily mean that the cat is inside or outside.\n5. The given conditional statement only tells us what happens when the dog is inside, but it doesn't specify anything about when the dog is not inside.\n6. Therefore, based on these statements alone, we cannot infer 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
