This means that the first condition of the second statement ('If the car was red') is false.\n2. In logic, when the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is false, the entire statement is considered true. So, even though we don't know if the truck is blue or not based on the given information, the second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is true because its condition is false.\n3. However, this doesn't allow us to infer that 'The truck was not blue'. The color of the truck remains unknown based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
