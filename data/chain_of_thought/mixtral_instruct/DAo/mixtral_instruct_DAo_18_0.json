We also know that \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (2).\n3. To determine if we can infer \"the truck was not metal,\" let's consider what would happen if the truck were metal. If the truck were metal, then according to statement (2), the doll must be plastic. However, we know from statement (1) that the doll is not plastic.\n4. Therefore, since the assumption that the truck is metal leads to a contradiction with the given information, it follows that the truck cannot be metal.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
