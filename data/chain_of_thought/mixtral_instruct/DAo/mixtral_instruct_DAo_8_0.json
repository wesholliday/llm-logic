This second statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n4. In this case, it means that the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake.\n5. Since we know that the vampire was not awake, the condition of the second statement has not been met.\n6. Therefore, based on the information given and the logical relationship between the two statements, we cannot infer that \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
