Since Sam didn't take a plane, the condition of the second statement is false.\n4. In logic, when the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is false, the entire statement becomes true regardless of whether the conclusion (Erin took a train) is actually true or not.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'Erin did not take a train'. We can only conclude that the second statement is true because its condition is false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
