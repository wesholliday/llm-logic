We also know that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n3. Since we know that the cake is not chocolate, the condition of the second statement is false.\n4. In logic, when the condition of an 'if-then' statement is false, the entire statement becomes true by default, regardless of whether the conclusion (the part after 'then') is actually true or false.\n5. However, since the entire 'if-then' statement is considered true in this case, we cannot infer anything about the muffins based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
