The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'.\n3. Since Alex did not finish the race, the condition in the second statement is false.\n4. In logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement (both the condition and conclusion) is considered to be true.\n5. However, since the condition is false, the truth of the conclusion ('Chris finished the race') does not follow.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Chris did not finish the race' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
