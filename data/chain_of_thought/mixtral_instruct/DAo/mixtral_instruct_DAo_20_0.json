We know that \"The apple was not red.\" This means that the first condition of the second statement, \"If the apple was red,\" is false.\n2. In logic, when the if-part (the condition) of a conditional statement is false, the whole statement is considered to be true. So even though we don't know whether the banana was yellow or not, the truth of the second statement doesn't matter because its condition is false.\n3. Therefore, from \"The apple was not red\" and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we cannot infer \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
