These two statements are not logically connected in a way that makes the conclusion follow from the premise.\n\nStep 3: Consider counterexamples.\nImagine a scenario where the milk could be on the counter or in the refrigerator. The fact that there's a possibility it's not on the counter doesn't mean it can't also be somewhere else, like in the refrigerator. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
