She could have chosen either one, but she ended up picking salad. In this case, it's true that Sue might not have chosen pizza (premise), and it's also true that she wasn't forced to choose pizza (conclusion).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the argument based on your analysis.\nThe given form of argument is logically valid because there are no cases where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. If Sue might not have chosen pizza, then it follows that she wasn't required to make that choice.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
