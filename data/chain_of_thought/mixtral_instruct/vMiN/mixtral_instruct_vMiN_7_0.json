In this case, the premise and conclusion would both be true.\n- Now consider if the argument were invalid; for it to be invalid, there would need to be a situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. However, in any scenario where Alex might not have finished the race, denying the necessity of their finishing still holds true.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument form is logically valid.\nThe argument form is indeed logically valid because there are no counterexamples or alternative scenarios that would make the premise true and the conclusion false simultaneously. The conclusion correctly follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
