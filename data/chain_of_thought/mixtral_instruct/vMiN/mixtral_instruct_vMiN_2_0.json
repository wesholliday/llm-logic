This is equivalent to saying 'It is not necessarily true that the griffin is in the forest.'\n2. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, which can be written as 'Not necessarily, the griffin is in the forest.'\n3. Both the premise and the conclusion express the same idea: there is no necessity for the griffin to be in the forest.\n4. Therefore, the argument form is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise without any contradiction or logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
