In this case, it's true that she might not have been at one specific wedding (let's say Wedding A), but it is also possible that she must have been at the other wedding (Wedding B). This shows that the argument form isn't logically valid since there can be cases where the premise is true, yet the conclusion is false.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nAnswer: No, this form of argument is not logically valid because it doesn't follow a correct logical structure and allows for counterexamples where the premise can be true while the conclusion is false.",
