This implies that it's possible that the watch is not on the dresser or it's possible that the watch is on the dresser but not charging.\n3. The conclusion denies that the watch must be charging on the dresser, which means it allows for the possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n4. Since the premise also allows for this possibility, the argument is logically valid because the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
