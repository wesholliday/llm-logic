We also know that the wolf was in the den (D).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the bear was in the cave because there could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den besides the bear being in the cave. For example, the wolf might have been in the den for some reason unrelated to the bear's location. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No.",
