We are given that Erin took a train (B).\n3. However, the original statement also tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since we already know that Erin took a train, this doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane as well. It could be true, but it could also be the case that some other condition led to Erin taking a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes, but only assuming the given conditions are true and there are no other factors at play. The statement does not definitively prove that Sam took a plane.",
