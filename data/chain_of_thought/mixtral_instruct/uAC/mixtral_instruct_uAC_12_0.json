We have the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement where the condition (Joe going to the park) leads to a consequence (Lucy going to the zoo).\n2. The next statement given is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n3. From this information alone, we cannot definitively say that Joe went to the park because Lucy could have gone to the zoo for some other reason besides Joe going to the park.\n4. However, since the original statement included \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" and we know Lucy did go to the zoo, it's possible that Joe went to the park. But based on the given information, we cannot infer it as a fact.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot definitively infer that Joe went to the park.",
