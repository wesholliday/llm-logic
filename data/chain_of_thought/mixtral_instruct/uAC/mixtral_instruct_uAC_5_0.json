We have the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - The hypothesis is \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n   - The conclusion is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. Then we are told that \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nNow let's consider what we know:\n- Amy playing tennis is the conclusion of our conditional statement, but knowing only the conclusion is not enough to confirm the hypothesis. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nSo even though we know that Amy played tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: No.",
