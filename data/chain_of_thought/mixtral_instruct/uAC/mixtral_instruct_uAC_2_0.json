We also know that the unicorn was in the forest (a fact).\n3. From these two pieces of information, we cannot directly infer that the griffin was in the forest because the if-then statement only tells us that if the griffin was there, then the unicorn would be too. It doesn't guarantee that the griffin's presence is required for the unicorn to be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No.",
