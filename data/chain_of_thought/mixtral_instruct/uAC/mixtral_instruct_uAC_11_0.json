We have the statement \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n2. The next statement given is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the cake was chocolate, let's consider what these statements mean:\n\n1. From the first statement alone, we cannot conclude that the cake is chocolate because it only tells us what would happen to the muffins under those circumstances, not the actual state of the cake or muffins.\n2. However, when combined with the second statement \"the muffins were blueberry,\" we can use logical reasoning to infer that the cake was indeed chocolate. This is because the first statement sets up a direct correlation between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. Since we know the muffins are blueberry, it follows that the condition for this to be true is if the cake is chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
