To determine if we can infer that the dog was inside, let's apply Modus Ponens, a rule of inference in logic. \n   - Modus Ponens: (P -> Q) and P, therefore Q.\n   \n3. In our case, P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat was outside\". So, the first statement (a) is (P -> Q). The second statement (b) is Q.\n\n4. Now we can apply Modus Ponens:\n   - If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (P -> Q).\n   - The dog was inside (P).\n   - Therefore, the cat was outside (Q).\n\n5. However, we already know that the cat was outside from statement (b). So, this information doesn't help us determine whether the dog was inside or not.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the dog was inside based on the given statements.",
