We are also told that \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, can we conclude that \"the apple was red\"? Not necessarily. The second statement about the banana being yellow does not specify whether it is yellow because the apple is red or for some other reason. Therefore, even though the first statement suggests a connection between a red apple and a yellow banana, the second statement standing alone does not confirm that connection.\n\nAnswer: No.",
