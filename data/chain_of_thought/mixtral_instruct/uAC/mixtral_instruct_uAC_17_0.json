We know that \"if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement where the condition (Ben eating pasta) leads to a consequence (Kate eating salad).\n2. We also know that \"Kate ate salad.\"\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that Ben ate pasta because even if Kate did eat salad, it doesn't necessarily mean that Ben's pasta eating caused it. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot confirm whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
