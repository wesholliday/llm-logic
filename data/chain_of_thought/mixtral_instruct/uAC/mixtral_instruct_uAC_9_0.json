We also know that Mark actually did buy the blue shirt (we'll call this statement B).\n3. From step 2, we cannot directly conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt because there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n4. However, since we have both statements A and B true in our scenario, it confirms the rule that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n5. But based on the information provided alone, we cannot definitively say whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. It is possible but not certain.\n\nAnswer: The information provided does not allow us to infer with absolute certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt.",
