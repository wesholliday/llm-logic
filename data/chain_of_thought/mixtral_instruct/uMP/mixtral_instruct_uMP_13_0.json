This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P represents \"the car was red,\" and Q represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n2. The car was red (P is true).\n3. Now we need to determine if Q (the truck was blue) is true based on the given information.\n\nSince P is true and \"If P, then Q\" is a given condition, it follows that Q must also be true. Therefore, the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
