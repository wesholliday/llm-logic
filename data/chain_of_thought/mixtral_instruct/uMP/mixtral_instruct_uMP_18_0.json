Modus ponens states that if P implies Q and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\nStep 4: In our case, P represents \"the doll was plastic,\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\" Since we know that the doll was plastic (P is true), and if the doll being plastic implies the truck was metal (P implies Q), it follows that the truck was metal (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
