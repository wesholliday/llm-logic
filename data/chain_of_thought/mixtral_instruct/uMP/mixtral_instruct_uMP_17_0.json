We also know that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n3. Given the first statement and the fact that Ben did indeed eat pasta, we can infer that \"Kate ate salad\" must be true as well. This is because when 'if A then B' is true, and we find out that A is true, it follows logically that B must also be true.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
