We know that \"if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We are also told that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n3. Given these two pieces of information, we can apply modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic which states that if P implies Q and P is true, then Q must be true.\n4. Here, P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n5. Since both P and \"if P, then Q\" are true, we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
