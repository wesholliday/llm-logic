We know that \"if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" or \"implies\" in logic.\n2. We are also told that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n3. Given these two pieces of information, we can apply modus ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus ponens states: P -> Q, P \u2234 Q (If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.)\n4. In this case, P represents \"Joe went to the park,\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" Since both P and the conditional statement P -> Q are true, we can infer that Q, or \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
