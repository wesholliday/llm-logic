We know that \"if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We are also told that \"the dog was inside.\"\n3. Given these two pieces of information, we can apply the condition from step 1 and conclude that \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThis is because when a conditional statement is true and its condition (in this case, \"if the dog was inside\") is met, then the conclusion (\"then the cat was outside\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
