We are given the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. The part before the 'then' is called the hypothesis, and the part after the 'then' is called the conclusion.\n\n2. We are also given that \"the bear was in the cave.\" According to our first statement, if the bear being in the cave is true, then it should follow that the wolf is in the den.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship established by the conditional statements:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
