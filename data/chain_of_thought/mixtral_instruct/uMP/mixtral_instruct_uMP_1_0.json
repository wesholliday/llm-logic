Modus Ponens states that if p \u2192 q is true and p is true, then q must be true. In this case, p represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 4: Since we know that Mary was at the wedding (p is true), applying Modus Ponens to our given conditional statement, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding (q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
