We know that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We are also told that \"the cake was chocolate.\"\n3. Given these two pieces of information, we can apply what's known as modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic. Modus ponens states: P -> Q, P; therefore, Q. In this case, the first P represents \"the cake was chocolate,\" Q represents \"the muffins were blueberry,\" and the arrow (->) represents \"if...then...\"\n4. So, since we know that \"the cake was chocolate\" (P), and that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (P -> Q), we can infer that \"the muffins were blueberry\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
