            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. Given statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (We can write this as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\")\n2. Another given statement: Sue was not at the wedding. (We can write this as \"\u00acSue\")\n3. We want to find out if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding. (We can write this as \"\u00acMary\")\n\nNow, let's think about how these statements relate to each other:\n\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n- However, the second given statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n- In logic, when we have a conditional statement and its consequence is false, we can infer that the condition must be false as well (this is called Modus Tollens).\n- Therefore, since Sue was not at the wedding, it follows that Mary could not have been at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
