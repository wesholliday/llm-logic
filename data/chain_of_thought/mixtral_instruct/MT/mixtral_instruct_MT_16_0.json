            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is called a material implication and it can be symbolized as: (C -> D) where C represents 'The shirt is cotton' and D represents 'The pants are denim.'\n2. Then we are given that 'The pants were not denim,' which can be represented as \u00acD.\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton,' represented as \u00acC.\n4. To do this, we need to understand the concept of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In our case, the contrapositive would be \"If the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\"\n5. Since we know that 'The pants were not denim' (\u00acD), using the contrapositive rule, we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' (\u00acC).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
