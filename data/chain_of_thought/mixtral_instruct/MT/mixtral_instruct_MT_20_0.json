            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical proposition in logic. It can be symbolized as P -> Q, where P represents 'the apple is red' and Q represents 'the banana is yellow'.\n2. We also know that \"The banana was not yellow,\" which can be symbolized as ~Q.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red,\" symbolized as ~P.\n4. To do this, we use a rule of inference called Modus Tollens, which states that from P -> Q and ~Q, we can infer ~P.\n5. In our case, P is 'the apple is red', Q is 'the banana is yellow', and ~Q is 'the banana is not yellow'.\n6. Since the given statements match those required for Modus Tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
