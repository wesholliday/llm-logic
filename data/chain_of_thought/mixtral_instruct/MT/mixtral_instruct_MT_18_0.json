            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is known as a material implication in logic, denoted as P -> Q, where P is 'the doll is plastic' and Q is 'the truck is metal.'\n2. Next, we are told that 'the truck was not metal,' or ~Q in logical notation.\n3. To determine if we can infer 'the doll was not plastic' (~P), we need to examine the given conditional statement. \n4. In this case, the conditional statement is only false when P is true and Q is false, which corresponds to the scenario where the doll is indeed plastic but the truck is not metal.\n5. However, since we know that the truck was not metal (~Q), it means that the original conditional statement cannot be true because its consequent (the truck being metal) is false.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'the doll was not plastic' (~P). It could be the case, but we do not have enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
