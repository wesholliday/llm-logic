            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an example of a material implication, often denoted as P \u2192 Q, where P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel.'\n2. We are also given that 'The book is not a mystery novel,' which means \u00acQ in our logical notation.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James,' denoted as \u00acP.\n4. To do this, we can use Modus Tollens, a valid form of argument that states: If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ are true, then \u00acP must be true.\n5. In our given information, P represents 'the book was written by James' and \u00acQ represents 'the book is not a mystery novel.' Since both P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ are true, we can apply Modus Tollens to infer that \u00acP, or 'the book was not written by James,' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
