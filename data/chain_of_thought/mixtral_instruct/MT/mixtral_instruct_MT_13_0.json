            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical or an implication. It means that if the car has the property of being red, then as a consequence, the truck has the property of being blue.\n2. The next statement given is \"The truck was not blue.\" This is a negation of the statement \"The truck is blue.\"\n3. To determine whether we can infer \"The car was not red,\" we need to consider whether the given statements allow for any other possibility.\n4. In this case, if the truck being not blue contradicts the condition that the car being red implies the truck being blue, then it must be that the car is not red.\n5. This is because, according to the first statement, the only way for the truck not to be blue would be for the car not to be red.\n6. Therefore, given \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was not blue,\" we can indeed infer \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
