            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n2. The second statement tells us that \"the mummy was not awake,\" which is represented as ~Q.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"the vampire was not awake,\" represented as ~P, based on the given statements.\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if the vampire were actually awake (P). According to our first statement, if P is true, then Q (the mummy being awake) must also be true. However, we know from the second statement that ~Q (the mummy was not awake).\n5. Since having both P and ~Q at the same time leads to a contradiction, it means that P cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"the vampire was not awake,\" represented as ~P.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
