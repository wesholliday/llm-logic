This means that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n3. However, we are told that the muffins were not blueberry.\n4. Since the consequence is false, according to the rules of logic, the condition could be either true or false. It's possible that the cake is chocolate (but then the conditional statement would be incorrect), or it's possible that the cake is not chocolate.\n5. Without further information, we cannot definitively say whether the cake is chocolate or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
