            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is also known as a material implication, which can be symbolized as P -> Q, where P represents 'Sue chose pizza' and Q represents 'Bob chose pasta'.\n2. Next, we are told that 'Bob did not choose pasta', or ~Q in logical notation.\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', which is represented as ~P.\n4. To do this, let's use Modus Tollens, a valid form of argument that states: If P -> Q and ~Q, then ~P.\n5. In our given information, we have both P -> Q (Sue chose pizza implies Bob chose pasta) and ~Q (Bob did not choose pasta).\n6. Therefore, using Modus Tollens, we can indeed infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', or ~P.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
