            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is known as a material implication, which can be symbolized as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. We are also given that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be symbolized as \u00acQ.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" represented as \u00acP, based on the given information.\n4. To do this, we can use a logical principle called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. In other words, if the original implication is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n5. Since we know that \u00acQ (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), and our given conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (P \u2192 Q), we can apply the contrapositive principle to get \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (Mark did not buy the blue shirt implies that Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n6. Therefore, based on the given information and applying logical principles, we can indeed infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
