            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as: P -> Q, where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n2. The second statement tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo (~Q).\n3. Now we want to find out if Joe went to the park (P) or not.\n4. Based on the given information, we cannot conclude for certain whether Joe went to the park or not because there is no direct contradiction between the two statements that would allow us to make that inference.\n5. However, it's important to note that if Joe did go to the park (P), then according to the first statement, Lucy should have gone to the zoo (Q). But we know this isn't true because Lucy didn't go to the zoo (~Q). This inconsistency suggests that Joe probably didn't go to the park either.\n6. So while we cannot definitively say 'Joe did not go to the park', the given information does make it highly unlikely.\n\nAnswer: The given statements do not allow us to infer 'Joe did not go to the park' with absolute certainty, but they strongly suggest that he didn't.",
