We are given the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" in logic.\n2. Next, we are told that \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n3. From this information, can we conclude that \"Erin did not take a train\"? \n\nTo answer this question, let's consider the two possible scenarios based on the given conditional statement:\na) Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\nb) Sam didn't take a plane, so we don't know if Erin took a train or not.\n\nSince we are told that Sam did not take a plane, we cannot use scenario (a). We must rely on scenario (b), which does not provide enough information about Erin's transportation. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No.",
