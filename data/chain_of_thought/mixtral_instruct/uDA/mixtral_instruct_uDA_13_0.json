            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a type of logical statement called a conditional, where the first part (the car being red) is called the antecedent and the second part (the truck being blue) is called the consequent.\n2. Then we are told that \"the car was not red.\" \n3. The question asks if we can infer that \"the truck was not blue.\"\n4. To answer this, we need to consider whether the given information allows us to make a definitive statement about the color of the truck.\n5. Since the initial conditional statement only tells us what happens when the car is red, and we now know that the car is not red, the color of the truck cannot be determined from this information alone.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
