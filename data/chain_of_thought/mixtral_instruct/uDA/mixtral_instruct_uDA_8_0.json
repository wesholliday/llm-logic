We are also told that the vampire was not awake.\n3. Based on the first point, if the vampire had been awake, then the mummy would have been awake too. But since we know from the second point that the vampire was not awake, this situation does not occur.\n4. Therefore, there is no information given about the mummy's state of awakeness when the vampire is not awake. It could be that the mummy is also not awake, but it could also be that the mummy is awake. The information provided does not allow us to determine this.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based on the given information.",
