We are also told that Mary was not at the wedding.\n3. Based on the first point and the information given about Mary, we cannot determine whether Sue was at the wedding or not. The truth of Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence, which we know is false. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Sue was also not at the wedding. It could be the case that Sue would have been at the wedding if Mary had been there, but since Mary wasn't, Sue staying away has no impact.\n\nAnswer: No.",
