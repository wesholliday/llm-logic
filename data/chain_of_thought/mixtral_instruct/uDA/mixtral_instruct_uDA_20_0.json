We are given the conditional statement \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a type of logical statement called an implication, where the truth of the first part (the antecedent) implies the truth of the second part (the consequent).\n2. However, we are also told that \"the apple was not red,\" which negates the antecedent of our conditional statement.\n3. When the antecedent is false, the truth value of an implication cannot be determined solely based on the implication itself. In other words, if the apple isn't red, we can't make any conclusions about the color of the banana just from this information alone.\n4. Therefore, without further context or information, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
