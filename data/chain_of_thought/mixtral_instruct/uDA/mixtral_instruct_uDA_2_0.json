Based on the first statement, we cannot directly determine whether the unicorn was in the forest or not because it only tells us about a relationship between the presence of the griffin and the unicorn in the forest.\n4. However, since we know that the griffin was not in the forest, there is no evidence to conclude that the unicorn must have been in the forest either.\n5. Therefore, it's possible that the unicorn was also not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
