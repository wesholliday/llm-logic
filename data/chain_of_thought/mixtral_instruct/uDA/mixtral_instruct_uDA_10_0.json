This is a conditional statement where the presence of the dog inside implies the absence of the cat outside.\n2. However, we are told that the dog was not inside. Since the condition for the cat being outside is not met (because the dog is not inside), we cannot make any conclusions about the cat's location based solely on this information.\n3. Therefore, it would be an incorrect assumption to conclude that the cat was not outside just because the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
