This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if p, then q.\"\n2. However, we are also told that the book was not written by James. This is a separate piece of information, which negates the condition (p) in our first statement.\n3. When the condition (p) is negated, we cannot definitively determine what type of book it is based solely on this information. We only know for certain that the book was not written by James.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel. It could still be a mystery novel if someone else wrote it, or it might be another type of book entirely.\n\nAnswer: No.",
