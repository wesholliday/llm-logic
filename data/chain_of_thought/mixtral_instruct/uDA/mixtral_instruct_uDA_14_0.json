Since the condition for the wolf being in the den is based on the bear being in the cave, and we know that the bear is not in the cave, there is no basis for concluding that the wolf is in the den.\n4. But does this mean the wolf isn't in the den? Not necessarily. We only know that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. We don't have any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave.\n5. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the wolf was or was not in the den based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
