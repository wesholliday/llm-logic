We also know that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (let's call this statement 2).\n3. From statement 2, using the principle of transposition, we can infer that \"if Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\".\n4. However, from statement 1 alone, we cannot definitively conclude whether Kate ate salad or not because it is a conditional statement dependent on Ben eating pasta.\n5. Since we now know for certain that Ben did not eat pasta (from statement 2), and using our transposed statement from step 3, we can infer that \"Kate did not eat salad\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
