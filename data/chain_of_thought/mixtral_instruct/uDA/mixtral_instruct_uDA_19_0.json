We know that \"if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" or \"implies\" in logic.\n2. However, we also know that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n3. Given the first piece of information, if Tom had watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball.
