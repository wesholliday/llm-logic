From the first statement, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we can infer that if Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris to finish the race.\n2. However, the second statement tells us that \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n3. Since Alex not finishing the race is not in contradiction with the condition stated in the first statement (it only says that *if* Alex finishes, then Chris does too), we cannot directly infer from these statements that Chris did not finish the race.\n4. It's possible that Chris could still have finished the race even if Alex didn't, as long as there isn't a requirement for Alex to finish before Chris can.\n\nAnswer: No.",
