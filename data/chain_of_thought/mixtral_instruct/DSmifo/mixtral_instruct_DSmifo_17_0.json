We have two statements: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" and \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\".\n2. The first statement tells us that there's a possibility that the scarf isn't on the coat rack, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities (like the scarf being in the backpack).\n3. The second statement presents two options: either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it's in the backpack. Since we know from the first statement that the scarf might not be on the coat rack, we can consider the second option.\n4. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack' is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
