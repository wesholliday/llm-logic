We have two statements: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" and \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\".\n2. The first statement tells us that it is possible for the sunglasses to not be on her head, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities like them being in her bag.\n3. The second statement gives us two options: a) the sunglasses are perched on her head or b) they are in her bag.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the sunglasses might not be on her head, option a) is potentially false.\n5. Therefore, if option a) is false, then by default, option b) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
