We have two statements: \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" and \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist, but it doesn't exclude other possibilities like the watch being somewhere else or charging on the dresser.\n3. The second statement presents two mutually exclusive options: either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that there are possible scenarios where the watch is not on his wrist, we can consider the second option in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The watch is charging on the dresser' is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
