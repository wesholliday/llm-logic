We know that the statement 'The pen might not be on my desk' does not definitively say where the pen is, only that it is possibly not on the desk.\n2. The second statement, 'Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag', presents two possibilities: a) the pen is on the desk, or b) the pen is in the bag.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the pen might not be on the desk, this implies that the pen could indeed be in the bag.\n4. However, to definitively conclude 'The pen is in my bag', we would need additional information excluding other possibilities (e.g., it being lost or given away).\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot definitively infer 'The pen is in my bag' from these statements alone.",
