We have two statements: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" and \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\".\n2. The first statement tells us that the notebook may not be in its usual place (on the nightstand), but it doesn't explicitly say where else it could be.\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: a) the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, or b) it is in the drawer.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, we can infer that it must be in the drawer based on the second statement's second possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
