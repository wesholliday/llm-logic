This means that there is a possibility that the milk is not being cooled in the fridge.\n2. Then we have the statement 'Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter'. This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements must be true.\n3. However, just because the milk might not be chilling in the fridge does not necessarily mean that it is on the counter. It could be somewhere else entirely, like in a cooler or even thrown away.\n4. Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot definitively infer 'The milk is on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
