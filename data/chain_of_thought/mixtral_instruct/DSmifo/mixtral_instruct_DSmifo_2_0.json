            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements here: \"The book might not be resting on the table\" and \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\".\n2. The first statement tells us that it's possible that the book is not on the table, but it doesn't exclude other locations for the book.\n3. The second statement gives us two options: a) the book is resting on the table, or b) the book is on the shelf.\n4. However, the first statement contradicts option a) from the second statement because it tells us that the book might not be on the table.\n5. Therefore, since the book cannot be on the table according to the first statement, and the only other option given is that the book is on the shelf, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
