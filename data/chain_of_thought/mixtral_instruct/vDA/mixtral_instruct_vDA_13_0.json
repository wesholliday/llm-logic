            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical proposition or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second premise states that the car was not red. This is a negative statement about the car's color.\n3. Now let's consider what follows from these two premises: if the car was not red, then the condition stated in the first premise (if the car was red) is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truck's color based on this information alone.\n4. The conclusion states that the truck was not blue. However, this does not necessarily follow from the two premises provided. We only know that if the car had been red, then the truck would have been blue. But since the car was not red, we cannot make any conclusions about the truck's color based on these premises alone.\n5. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
