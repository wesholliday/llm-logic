The second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball.\n3. Given the second premise, the condition in the first premise cannot be met because its antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is false.\n4. Since the condition in the first premise cannot be met, the consequent (Amy playing tennis) also cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, based on this reasoning, we can conclude that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
