            "content": "Step by step:\n1. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement where the presence of the griffin serves as the condition for the presence of the unicorn.\n2. The second premise negates the presence of the griffin in the forest.\n3. Given these two premises, the conclusion then states that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n4. To evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use a method called modus tollens, which is a form of deductive reasoning. The structure of modus tollens is as follows: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P.\n5. In this case, the first premise translates to 'if griffin (P), then unicorn (Q)'. The second premise becomes 'not Q' and the conclusion is 'not P'. This matches the structure of modus tollens.\n6. Therefore, if both premises are true, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical form.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
