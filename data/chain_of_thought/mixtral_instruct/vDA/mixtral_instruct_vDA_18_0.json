            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement where the condition (doll being plastic) leads to a consequence (truck being metal).\n2. The second premise negates the condition of the first premise by stating that the doll was not plastic.\n3. Given the second premise, the condition in the first premise is false.\n4. In a conditional statement, if the condition is false, then the whole statement is considered to be true (regardless of whether the consequence is true or false).\n5. Therefore, since the first premise is true given the second premise, there is no need to consider the consequence of the first premise (truck being metal) when determining the validity of this argument form.\n6. The conclusion states that the truck was not metal.\n7. Since we have no information about whether the truck is actually metal or not based on the given premises, it's impossible to determine if the conclusion is true or false.\n8. However, the truth value of the conclusion doesn't affect the validity of an argument form. An argument form is valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, regardless of whether they are actually true or false.\n9. In this case, even though we don't know if the conclusion is true or false, it does follow logically from the premises because the first premise is a conditional statement that becomes true when its condition is false (which is what the second premise states).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
