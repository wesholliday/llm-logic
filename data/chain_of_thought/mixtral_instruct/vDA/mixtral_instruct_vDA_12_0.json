The second premise states that Joe did not go to the park. This is the negation of the antecedent (P) in our conditional statement from step 1.\n3. Logical validity refers to an argument's form, not its content. In this case, we have a hypothetical syllogism: \"If P, then Q; Not-P; Therefore, Not-Q\".\n4. This form of argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of logic. If the premises were true, the conclusion must also be true due to the nature of this specific logical structure.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
