This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise states that Alex did not finish the race.\n3. If we assume the truth of both premises, then according to the first premise, if Alex didn't finish the race, it doesn't necessarily mean Chris didn't either. It only means that *if* Alex finished, *then* Chris would have too. But since Alex didn't finish (second premise), this conditional statement doesn't give us any information about Chris's finishing the race.\n4. Therefore, based on these two premises alone, we cannot logically infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: No.",
