This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical proposition or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second premise states that the apple was not red. This is a negative statement denying the antecedent of the first premise.\n3. Now, let's consider whether the conclusion logically follows from these two premises. If the apple was not red, then the condition stated in the first premise does not apply because its antecedent is false. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the color of the banana based on this argument alone.\n4. The conclusion states that the banana was not yellow. However, this does not necessarily follow from the given premises since there could be other reasons for the banana being yellow or not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
