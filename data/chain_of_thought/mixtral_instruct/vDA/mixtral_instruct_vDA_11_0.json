This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise states that the cake was not chocolate.\n3. From these two premises, we can infer that since the cake was not chocolate, it does not meet the condition for the muffins to be blueberry (as stated in the first premise).\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the muffins could not have been blueberry for some other reason. The argument only denies the connection between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n5. Therefore, while it may be reasonable to conclude that the muffins were not blueberry based on these premises, the argument is not logically valid because it does not rule out the possibility that the muffins could have been blueberry for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: No.",
