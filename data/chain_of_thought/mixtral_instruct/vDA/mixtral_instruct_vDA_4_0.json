The second premise states that the alien did not visit Mars. This is a negation of the antecedent in our conditional statement from step 1.\n3. The conclusion states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This is the negation of the consequent in our conditional statement from step 1.\n4. In logic, an argument form is valid if and only if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the same time.\n5. Given our two premises, they cannot both be true and the conclusion false because we have a contradiction between the first premise and the second premise (if P implies Q but not-P is given, then Q must be true).\n6. Therefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true due to the nature of the conditional statement in our first premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
