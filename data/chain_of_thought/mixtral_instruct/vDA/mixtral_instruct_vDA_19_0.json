The second premise states that Tom did not watch football (~P).\n3. We want to determine whether the conclusion, \"Jen did not watch basketball\" (~Q), follows logically from these premises.\n4. Given the first premise and the second premise, we can use Modus Tollens to deduce that Jen did not watch basketball (~Q). The argument form is:\n   P -> Q\n   ~P\n   ------\n   ~Q\n\n5. This argument form is logically valid because if the first premise and the second premise are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
