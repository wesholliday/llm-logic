            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise negates the antecedent of the first premise, stating that the shirt was not cotton.\n3. Given the truth of the second premise, we cannot determine whether the pants are denim or not based on the first premise alone.\n4. However, since the argument form does not claim that the pants being denim can be inferred from the second premise alone, it is important to consider both premises together.\n5. When both premises are considered together, they contradict each other because the first premise implies that if the second premise were true (i.e., the shirt was not cotton), then the pants would have to be denim.\n6. Since the two premises cannot both be true at the same time, this argument form is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
