The second premise states that the vampire was not awake, which is represented as \"~Vampire awake\".\n3. The conclusion is that the mummy was not awake, which is represented as \"~Mummy awake\".\n4. Given the first and second premises, we can infer that ~(Vampire awake) AND (Vampire awake -> Mummy awake).\n5. From step 4, using logical rules of inference, we can deduce ~Mummy awake.\n6. Therefore, if both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
