The second premise states that Sam did not take a plane.\n3. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to see whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n4. Given the first and second premises together, if it's true that if Sam took a plane then Erin took a train, but Sam didn't take a plane, then it must be the case that Erin did not take a train.\n5. This is because the condition for Erin taking a train (Sam taking a plane) has not been met.\n6. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
