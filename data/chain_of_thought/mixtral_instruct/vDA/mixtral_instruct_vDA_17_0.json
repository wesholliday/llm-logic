The second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta.\n3. Given the second premise, we can use logical reasoning to infer that the condition stated in the first premise (Ben eating pasta) is not met.\n4. Since the condition of the hypothetical syllogism in the first premise is not met, it follows that the conclusion must be true based on the information provided.\n5. Therefore, if both premises are true, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
