This is a conditional statement where the presence of the dog inside is the condition and the presence of the cat outside is the result.\n2. The second premise states that the dog was not inside. This negates the condition in the first premise.\n3. However, the conclusion states that the cat was not outside, which contradicts the result stated in the first premise when the condition from the second premise is applied.\n4. If we apply Modus Tollens to this argument (if P, then Q; not P, therefore not Q), it would lead us to conclude that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. But this is not what the conclusion states.\n5. Therefore, the form of argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
