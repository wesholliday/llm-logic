            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n3. From these two premises, we can infer that since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it follows logically that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is because the first premise sets up a direct relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt - if one happens, then the other happens; if one doesn't happen, then the other doesn't happen.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is logically valid given the two premises provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
