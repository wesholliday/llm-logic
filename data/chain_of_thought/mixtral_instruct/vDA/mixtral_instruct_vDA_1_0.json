            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism or a conditional proposition.\n2. The second premise denies the antecedent of the first premise by stating that Mary was not at the wedding.\n3. According to the principle of transitive inference, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent of a hypothetical syllogism can be either true or false; it does not matter.\n4. In this case, since the second premise denies the antecedent (Mary was not at the wedding), we cannot determine whether Sue was at the wedding or not based solely on the given information.\n5. However, the conclusion of the argument is that Sue was not at the wedding. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the two premises provided.\n6. Therefore, the form of argument is not logically valid because the truth of its conclusion cannot be guaranteed by the truth of its premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
