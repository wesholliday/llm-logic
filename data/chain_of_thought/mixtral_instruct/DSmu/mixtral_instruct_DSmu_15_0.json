We have two possible locations for the shoes: the closet or lined up by the door.\n2. The second statement tells us that it is not necessary for the shoes to be lined up by the door, which means they could still be in the closet.\n3. Since there are no other options given and one of the possibilities (shoes being lined up by the door) has been ruled out, we can infer that the remaining option must be true.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, it is reasonable to conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
