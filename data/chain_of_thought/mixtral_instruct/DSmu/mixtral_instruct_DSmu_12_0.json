We have two possible states for the jacket: it is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n2. The second statement tells us that it is not necessary for the jacket to be hanging in the closet, which means the jacket can still be somewhere else besides the closet.\n3. Since there are no other options given and we know that the jacket isn't required to be in the closet, the only remaining possibility from our initial options is that 'The jacket is draped over the chair.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
