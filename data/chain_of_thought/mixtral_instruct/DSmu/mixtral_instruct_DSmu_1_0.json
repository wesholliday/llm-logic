We are given the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This is a logical disjunction (OR statement), which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second piece of information we have is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This negates the second part of our initial disjunction, meaning that Fido does not have to be in the garden.\n3. Since the first option in our original disjunction (\"Fido is inside\") has not been ruled out and the second option has been shown to be false, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
