We are given the statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\" This is a logical disjunction (OR statement), which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This negates the second part of the original disjunction. Since it cannot be necessary for the sock to be under the bed, this implies that there is no guarantee or requirement for the sock to be found there.\n3. Given these two pieces of information, we can now infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. This is because the first part of the original disjunction is still valid, and since the second part has been negated, the only remaining option is the first one: the sock being in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
