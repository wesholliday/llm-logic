We have two possible locations for the watch: either it's charging on the dresser or it's on his wrist.\n2. We are told that it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist (it could be elsewhere).\n3. Since we know that it must be in one of the two locations and it cannot be on his wrist, then by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
