This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the milk: on the counter or in the fridge.\n2. It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, meaning the milk does not need to be in the fridge.\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from this information:\n- Since the milk doesn't have to be in the fridge, it could still be on the counter (the other possibility).\n- There is no information given that would contradict or disprove the milk being on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer 'The milk is on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
