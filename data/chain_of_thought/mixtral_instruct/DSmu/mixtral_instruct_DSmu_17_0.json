This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the scarf: a) in the backpack, or b) on the coat rack and it needs to be there (it's obligatory).\n2. It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. This means that option b from the first statement is not true; therefore, we can eliminate the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack.\n\nSince we have only one remaining option after eliminating the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack, and that option is 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack', we can indeed infer that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
