We are given the statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This is a logical disjunction (OR statement), which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second piece of information we have is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This negates the second part of the original disjunction, meaning that it cannot be true that the pen must be on the desk.\n3. Since the second part of the original disjunction has been proven false, by process of elimination, the first part of the disjunction must be true: \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
