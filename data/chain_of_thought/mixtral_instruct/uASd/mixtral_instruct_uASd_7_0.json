This is given as a true statement in the question.\n\nStep 2: However, the second part of the statement adds an additional condition - \"and the pilot light is out.\" We do not have information about whether the kitchen will still be warm when the oven is on and the pilot light is out.\n\nStep 3: The pilot light could be a critical component for maintaining heat in the oven, or it might not make a difference if the main burners are lit. Without this knowledge, we cannot definitively say whether the kitchen would still be warm under these conditions.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.",
