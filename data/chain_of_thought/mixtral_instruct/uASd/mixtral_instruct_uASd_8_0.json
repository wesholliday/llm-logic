The original statement is \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\" This is a conditional statement where the shipment of the package (the condition) leads to the arrival of the package today (the conclusion).\n2. However, we are now adding an additional condition - that the package was misrouted. \n3. Being misrouted could potentially delay the delivery of the package, making it impossible for the package to arrive today.\n4. Therefore, even if the package has shipped and was misrouted, we cannot infer with certainty that it will still arrive today.\n\nAnswer: No.",
