It does not cover all possible scenarios at the concert, only stating that going to the concert results in having a good time. It doesn't account for other factors like safety issues or emergencies.\n\nStep 3: Consider the hypothetical situation.\nIn this case, it's about a bomb going off during the concert which is an emergency situation and clearly falls outside of the conditions specified in the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Make a conclusion based on reasoning.\nGiven that the original statement doesn't account for such extreme situations, we cannot infer from the original statement that if a bomb goes off at the concert, then we'll still have a good time. In fact, it would be more reasonable to assume the opposite since such an event would likely cause distress and harm rather than enjoyment.\n\nAnswer: No.",
