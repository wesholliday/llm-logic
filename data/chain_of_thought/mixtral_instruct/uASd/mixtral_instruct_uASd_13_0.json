Junk food is typically high in calories and can hinder weight loss efforts.\n\nStep 3: Combine these factors to evaluate the new scenario - \"If I exercise and eat junk food, will I lose weight?\" Given that exercising helps with weight loss but consuming junk food adds extra calories, it's unlikely that you would lose weight in this situation. Instead, your weight might stay the same or even increase due to the high-calorie intake from the junk food.\n\nAnswer: No.",
