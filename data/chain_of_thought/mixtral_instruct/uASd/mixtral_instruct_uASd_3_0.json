We know that \"if the car is in the garage, then it is safe.\" This is a conditional statement where the presence of the car in the garage implies safety.\n2. However, we are now adding another condition - \"the garage is flooding.\"\n3. Flooding would generally be considered a dangerous situation for a car.\n4. Therefore, even though the original statement holds true when isolated, combining it with the new information about the flood changes the conclusion.\n5. Answer: No, we cannot infer that the car is safe if it's in a flooding garage.",
