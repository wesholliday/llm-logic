The original statement does not account for this extra effort, which could lead to fatigue regardless of how much sleep one has had.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired because the original statement only addresses the effect of sleep on tiredness, not physical exertion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
