Drought means lack of water or extremely dry weather conditions.\n\nStep 3: Reflect on how drought would affect the outcome - even if you fertilize the lawn, during a drought, there might not be enough water for the grass to grow lush and green.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion - We cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green just because it's been fertilized and there is a drought.\n\nAnswer: No.",
