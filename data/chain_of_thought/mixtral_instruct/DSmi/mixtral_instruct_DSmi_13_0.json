This is a logical statement known as a disjunction, which means one part of the statement must be true.\n2. Then we are told that 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf'. This implies that there's a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n3. If it's possible for the toy to not be on the bookshelf, then the other option in our initial disjunction must be true: 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
