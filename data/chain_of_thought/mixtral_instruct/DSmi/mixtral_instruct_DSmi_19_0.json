We are told that it might not be on his wrist, which means there is a possibility that the watch is not in that location.\n3. However, just because the watch might not be on his wrist does not necessarily mean it must be charging on the dresser. It could also be elsewhere or even lost.\n4. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'The watch is charging on the dresser' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
