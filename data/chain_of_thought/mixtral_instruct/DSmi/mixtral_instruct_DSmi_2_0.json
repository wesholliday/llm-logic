This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the book.\n\nStep 2: The second statement tells us that the book might not be resting on the table, which implies that there is a possibility that the book is not at its usual place (the table).\n\nStep 3: Since we only have two possible locations for the book (on the shelf or on the table), and now we know that it's not on the table, then by process of elimination, the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
