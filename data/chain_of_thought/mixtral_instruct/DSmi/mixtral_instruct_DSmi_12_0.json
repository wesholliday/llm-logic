This is a statement of exhaustive possibilities, meaning one of these two options must be true.\n2. Then we are told that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility mentioned earlier.\n3. Since there's uncertainty regarding whether the jacket is hanging in the closet, and since this was presented as an exhaustive list of possibilities, it follows logically that the remaining option - the jacket being draped over the chair - must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
