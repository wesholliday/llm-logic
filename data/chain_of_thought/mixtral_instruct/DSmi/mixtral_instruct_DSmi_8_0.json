We have two statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. The first statement presents us with a disjunction (or) - it could mean that the remote control is on the coffee table, or it could mean that if the remote control isn't hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n3. The second statement tells us that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch. This does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the remote control being on the coffee table.\n4. However, this information alone doesn't allow us to definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table because we haven't ruled out other possible locations.\n\nAnswer: No.",
