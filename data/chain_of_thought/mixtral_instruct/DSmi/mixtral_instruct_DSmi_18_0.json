We have two statements: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" and \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. The first statement presents us with a choice: either the notebook is in the drawer or it's on the nightstand. There are no other options given.\n3. The second statement tells us that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n4. Since the first statement only provides two possibilities (drawer or nightstand), and the second statement suggests that the nightstand option may not be true, then by process of elimination, the notebook must be in the drawer.\n5. Answer: Yes",
