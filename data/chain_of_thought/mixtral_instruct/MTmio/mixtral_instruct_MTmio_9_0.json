            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt'. This means that there is a possibility that he didn't buy it.\n2. Then we are given the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This implies that if Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt, then Mark had no choice but to buy the blue shirt.\n3. However, since we already know that there is a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, this contradicts the second statement because it would mean that Lisa cannot simultaneously have bought the red shirt.\n4. Therefore, in order to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
