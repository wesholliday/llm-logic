The second statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement where if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. However, since we know that there's a possibility that 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo', this contradicts the second statement because if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then Joe cannot have gone to the park (since the condition for Joe going to the park is that Lucy must go to the zoo).\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
