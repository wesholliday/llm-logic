            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'The mummy might not have been awake'. This statement implies that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake.\n2. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake'. This is a conditional statement which means if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the conclusion (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n3. However, since we know from the first statement that there's a possibility that the mummy was not awake, this contradicts the conclusion of the second statement.\n4. Therefore, in order for the mummy to possibly be asleep, the condition of the second statement (the vampire being awake) cannot be true.\n5. Hence, we can infer 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
