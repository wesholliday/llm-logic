We know that from 'The banana might not have been yellow', it means that the color of the banana is uncertain; it could be any color but yellow, or even yellow.\n2. Then we have the conditional statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This means that if the apple is red, then the banana has to be yellow.\n3. However, since the color of the banana is uncertain, we cannot definitively say that the apple is not red based on this information alone. It's possible that the apple isn't red and the banana just happens to not be yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
