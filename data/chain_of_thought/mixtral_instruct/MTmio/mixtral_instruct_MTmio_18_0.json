We know that 'The truck might not have been metal' which means that there is a possibility that the truck was not made of metal.\n2. Then we are given 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. This is a conditional statement where if the condition (doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (truck being metal) must also be true.\n3. However, since we already know that there's a possibility that the truck wasn't metal, this contradicts the second statement because if the truck can be not metal, then the doll cannot be plastic.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, it is more likely that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
