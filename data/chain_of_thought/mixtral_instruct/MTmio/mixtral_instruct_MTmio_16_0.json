However, we also know that the pants might not have been denim.\n3. If the pants might not be denim, it means there is a possibility that they are not cotton either (since we don't have enough information to confirm their material).\n4. Since we cannot confirm whether the pants are denim or not, we cannot definitively say whether the condition for the shirt being cotton is met.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
