This statement means that there is a possibility that she didn't take a train, but it doesn't definitively say whether she took one or not.\n2. The second statement is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n3. However, since we don't know for sure whether Erin took a train or not, we cannot definitively say whether Sam took a plane or not based on this information alone.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
