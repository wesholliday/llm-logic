We also know that the muffins might not have been blueberry (let's call this statement B).\n3. If statement B is true, it means that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n4. According to statement A, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, statement B tells us that there is a chance they weren't.\n5. Therefore, since there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry even if the cake was chocolate, this contradicts statement A.\n6. Since statement A cannot be true, it implies that its condition (the cake being chocolate) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
