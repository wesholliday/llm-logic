            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We know that 'The truck might not have been blue'. This statement implies that there is a possibility that the truck is not blue.\n2. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n3. However, we know from the first statement that there is a possibility that the truck is not blue. Therefore, the second statement cannot always be true because it contradicts the first statement.\n4. If the second statement is not always true, then the car cannot always be red. \n5. So, based on these two statements, we can infer 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
