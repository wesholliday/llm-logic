We know that \"the book might not be a mystery novel.\" This statement means that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities.\n2. The second statement is \"if the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the result (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n3. However, we don't have enough information to determine whether the book was actually written by James or not. The first statement only tells us that there's a possibility that the book isn't a mystery novel, but it doesn't say who wrote it.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
