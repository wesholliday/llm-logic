We also know that 'Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked' (let's call this statement B).\n\nStatement B can be broken down into two parts:\na) The shank is nugged\nb) The shank is plooked\n\nSince we already know from statement A that the shank is not nugged, part a cannot be true. Therefore, if one of the two parts in statement B must be true, then it must be part b: 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
