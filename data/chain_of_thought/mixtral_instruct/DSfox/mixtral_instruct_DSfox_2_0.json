The first statement, \"The wug is not bimmed\", tells us that the wug does not possess the property of being bimmed.\n3. The second statement, \"Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped\", presents two possibilities: either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped.\n4. Given that we know from the first statement that the wug is not bimmed, we can eliminate the first possibility in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, since the only remaining possibility is that \"it is flooped\", and there are no other options presented, we can indeed infer that 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
