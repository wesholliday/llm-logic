The second statement is \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\". This is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the flug is zimmed, or it is blummed.\n3. Given that we know from the first statement that the flug is not zimmed, we can eliminate the first possibility presented in the second statement.\n4. Since only one of the two possibilities can be true, and the 'zimmed' option has been eliminated, the remaining possibility must be true.\n5. Therefore, the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
