We also know that 'Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled'. This statement presents two possibilities: either the fribble is crinked, or it has the property of being snurgled.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that the fribble is not crinked, then by process of elimination, the second part of the second statement must be true: the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
