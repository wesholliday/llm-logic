The second statement is 'Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled'. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the zinger is not smoogled. Therefore, the first part of the second statement ('the zinger is smoogled') cannot be true.\n4. Since at least one part of the disjunction must be true, it follows that the second part of the second statement ('it is fraggled') must be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
