We also know that 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked'. This statement presents two possibilities: either the whiffle has 'tinkedness', or it has another property, which we can call 'shankness'.\n3. However, since we already know from the first statement that the whiffle does not have 'tinkedness', the second possibility in the second statement must be true: the whiffle has 'shankness'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
