The second statement says, 'Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished'. This is a disjunction, which means one (or both) of its parts must be true.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that 'The twonk is not plinked', then the first part of the second statement ('the twonk is plinked') cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, for the whole disjunction to be true, the remaining part must be true: 'it is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
