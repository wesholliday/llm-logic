The statement \"Either A or B\" means at least one of them is true, but not necessarily both.\n3. Here, 'A' is \"the clug is snugged\", and 'B' is \"it is fleeked\".\n4. Since we know that \"The clug is not snugged\", this means that 'A' is false.\n5. Therefore, since at least one of the conditions must be true according to the second statement, 'B' (the clug is fleeked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
