The first statement tells us that the flob is not in a state of movation.\n3. The second statement is a disjunction (an 'or' statement), which means one of its components must be true.\n4. In this case, the second statement can be rewritten as \"The flob is movated or the flob is skizzled\".\n5. Given that we know from the first statement that the flob is not movated, it follows that the second part of the disjunction must be true.\n6. Therefore, the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
