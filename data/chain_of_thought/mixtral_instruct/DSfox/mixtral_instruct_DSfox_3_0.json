If 'The splat is quanked' were true, then the second statement would be true, but this contradicts our first statement.\n4. Therefore, 'The splat is quanked' must be false.\n5. Since 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed' is true and we know that 'The splat is quanked' is false, it follows that 'The splat is morphed' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
