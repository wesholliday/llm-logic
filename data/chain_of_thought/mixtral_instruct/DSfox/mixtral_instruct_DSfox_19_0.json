It could be vreebled, or it could be in some other unknown state.\n2. We also know that 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled'. This statement gives us two possibilities for the state of the smonk: plagged or vreebled.\n3. However, we already know from the first statement that the smonk is not plagged. Therefore, the second statement reduces to 'The smonk is vreebled' because the other possibility (plagged) has been ruled out.\n4. So yes, based on these two statements, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
