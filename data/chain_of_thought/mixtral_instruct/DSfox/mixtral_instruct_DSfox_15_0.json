The first statement tells us that the dreb is not spent.\n3. The second statement is a disjunction (an 'or' statement), which means one of its parts must be true.\n4. However, since we know from the first statement that \"The dreb is not spened\", the truth of this part of the second statement is ruled out.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility in the second statement is that \"it is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
