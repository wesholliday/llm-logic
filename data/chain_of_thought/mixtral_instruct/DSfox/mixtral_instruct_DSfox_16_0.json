The second statement is \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled\". This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n3. Given that the sneg is not sproted (from the first statement), it follows that the second part of the second statement must be true: \"it is crampled\".\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
