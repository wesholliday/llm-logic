The second statement is \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped\". This is a disjunction, meaning one (or both) of the two parts must be true.\n3. Given that the smip cannot be lupped (from our first statement), then the only remaining option in the second statement is that \"it is shripped\".\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements and applying logical reasoning, we can infer 'The smip is shripped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
