It could be in any number of states, but it is definitely not garbled.\n2. The second statement is 'Either the wug is garbled or it is sproinged'. This is a disjunction, meaning that one (or both) of the two possibilities must be true.\n3. However, we already know from the first statement that the wug is not garbled. Therefore, the second part of the second statement must be true: 'it is sproinged'.\n\nSo yes, given these two statements, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.",
