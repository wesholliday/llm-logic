The first statement is a fact, but it doesn't directly tell us whether the clug snugged or not.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have snugged.\n4. Now we need to determine if the given fact (\"The clug was fleeked\") satisfies the condition in the second statement. Since the clug was indeed fleeked, this condition is satisfied.\n5. Therefore, based on the conditional statement, we can infer that \"The clug snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
