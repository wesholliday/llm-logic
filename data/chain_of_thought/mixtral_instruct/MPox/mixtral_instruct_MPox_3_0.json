The first statement is a factual claim about something that happened in the past.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n4. Given that the first statement is true (the splat was indeed morphed), we can apply the truth of the first statement to the second statement's condition.\n5. Since the condition in the second statement is now satisfied (because the splat was morphed), we can infer the conclusion of the second statement, which is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
