We also know that \"if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the conclusion (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n4. In this case, since we know that the sprocket was indeed cranked, and according to our conditional statement, if it was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
