We have two premises:\n   a) \"The flugel was blimmed\"\n   b) \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\"\n\n2. To determine if we can infer \"The flugel was zargled,\" let's apply Modus Ponens, a valid form of argument in classical logic:\n   a) If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n   b) P (premise)\n   \u2234 Q (conclusion)\n\n3. In our case, P represents \"The flugel was blimmed,\" and Q represents \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n\n4. Applying Modus Ponens to the given premises:\n   a) If the flugel was blimmed (P), then the flugel was zargled (Q)\n   b) The flugel was blimmed (P)\n   \u2234 The flugel was zargled (Q)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
