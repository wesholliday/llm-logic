Given statement: \"The grommet was sploffed.\"\n2. Given conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The grommet plopped the frink', let's analyze the given conditional statement. The conditional statement has two parts: the antecedent (the 'if' part) and the consequent (the 'then' part). In this case, the antecedent is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and the consequent is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the truth of the given statement: \"The grommet was sploffed.\" If this statement is true, then the condition in the conditional statement is met. Since the condition is met, it follows that the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer 'The grommet plopped the frink'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
