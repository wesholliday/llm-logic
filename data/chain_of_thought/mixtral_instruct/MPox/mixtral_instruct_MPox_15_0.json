We also have the conditional statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n3. A conditional statement consists of a hypothesis (in this case, \"the dreb was vroombed\") and a conclusion (in this case, \"the dreb was spened\").\n4. Given that the hypothesis is true in this case (\"the dreb was vroombed\"), we can infer the conclusion based on the conditional statement.\n5. Therefore, since the dreb was indeed vroombed, it follows that the dreb was also spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
