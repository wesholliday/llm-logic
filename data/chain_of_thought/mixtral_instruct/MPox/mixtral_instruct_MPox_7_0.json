We also have a conditional statement (also known as an if-then statement): \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n3. Our goal is to determine whether we can infer that \"The whiffle tinked\" based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, we need to use Modus Ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Ponens states: If P -> Q and P are both true, then Q must be true.\n5. In our case, P represents \"The whiffle was shanked,\" and Q represents \"The whiffle tinked.\"\n6. Since we know that \"The whiffle was shanked\" (P) is true and the conditional statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" (P -> Q) is also true, we can apply Modus Ponens to deduce that \"The whiffle tinked\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
