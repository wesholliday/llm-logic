We know that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (let's call this statement A \u2192 B).\n2. We also know that the banana was yellow (B).\n3. Now we need to determine whether the apple was red (A) based on this information.\n4. From step 2, we only know that the banana being yellow is a consequence of the apple being red, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the apple had to be red for the banana to be yellow.\n5. For example, there could be other reasons why the banana was yellow, unrelated to the color of the apple.\n6. Therefore, just because the banana is yellow, we cannot conclude with certainty that the apple must have been red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
