We also know that Bob chose pasta (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B alone, we cannot definitively say whether or not Sue chose pizza because there could be other reasons why Bob might have chosen pasta.\n4. However, since we are given both statements A and B, we can use them together to determine the truth value of 'Sue chose pizza'.\n5. According to statement A, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Since we know from statement B that Bob did indeed choose pasta, it follows that Sue must have chosen pizza as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
