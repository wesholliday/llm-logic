We also know that Lucy went to the zoo (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B alone, we cannot definitively say whether Joe went to the park or not because statement A only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, but it doesn't guarantee that Joe went to the park whenever Lucy goes to the zoo.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Joe definitely went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
