We also know that Sue was at the wedding (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n4. Since we already know from statement B that Sue was at the wedding, it means that either both Mary and Sue were at the wedding or Sue was at the wedding without Mary.\n5. However, since statement A only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary being at the wedding is the only condition for Sue to be there.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
