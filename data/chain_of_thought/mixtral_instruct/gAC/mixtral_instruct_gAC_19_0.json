This is represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\".\n2. We also know that Jen did watch basketball.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Tom watched football. Here's why:\n\n- It's possible that Tom watching football causes Jen to watch basketball (as suggested by the first statement). However, it's also possible that something else caused Jen to watch basketball, and Tom didn't watch football at all. The given information doesn't provide enough evidence to determine whether or not Tom was watching football.\n\nAnswer: No.",
