            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and use logical reasoning:\n1. We know that 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is true (this is called a conditional statement).\n2. We also know that 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The griffin was in the forest' is true, we need to apply Modus Ponens, which states: If P -> Q and P are both true, then Q must be true.\n4. In our case, P represents 'The griffin was in the forest', and Q represents 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n5. Since we know that 'The unicorn was in the forest' (Q) is true and the conditional statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' (P -> Q) is true, we can apply Modus Ponens to find out if P is true.\n6. Since both P -> Q and Q are true, it follows that P must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
