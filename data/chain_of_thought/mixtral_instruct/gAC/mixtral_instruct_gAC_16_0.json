We also know that the pants were denim (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B alone, we cannot definitively say whether or not the shirt is cotton because statement A only tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, not the other way around.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that the pants were denim, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
