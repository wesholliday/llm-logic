We are also told that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. However, just because Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex finished the race as well. The statement only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris did too. It doesn't tell us anything about the situation where Chris finishes but we don't know about Alex.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude for certain whether or not Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No.",
