We also know that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only conclude that *if* the cake was chocolate, then the muffins being blueberry follows. However, it does not necessarily mean that the cake being chocolate is the only condition for the muffins to be blueberry.\n4. In fact, there could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry, unrelated to the cake being chocolate.\n5. Therefore, even though we know statement B is true, it does not definitively prove that statement A's condition (the cake being chocolate) is also true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
