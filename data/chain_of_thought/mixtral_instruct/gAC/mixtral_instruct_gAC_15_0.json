We also know that Erin took a train (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B alone, we cannot definitively say whether or not Sam took a plane because the truth of B does not necessarily imply the truth of A. \n4. In other words, even if Erin did take a train, it doesn't mean that Sam had to have taken a plane; he could have taken some other form of transportation or no transportation at all.\n\nAnswer: No.",
