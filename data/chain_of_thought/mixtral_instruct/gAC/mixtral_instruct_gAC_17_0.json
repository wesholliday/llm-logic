We know that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true. This can be written as: Ben eating pasta (B) \u2192 Kate eating salad (K).\n2. We also know that \"Kate ate salad\" (K) is true.\n3. However, just because the conditional statement (B \u2192 K) is true and its consequent (K) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that its antecedent (B) is true.\n4. In other words, even if Kate did eat salad, it doesn't guarantee that Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
