We are given two statements: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" and \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\".\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the sneg being crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sprouting the frink) must also be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that the consequence (the sneg sprouting the frink) is not true.\n4. From this information, we can infer that the condition (the sneg being crampled) cannot be true because if it were, then the consequence would have to be true as well, but we know that's not the case.\n5. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
