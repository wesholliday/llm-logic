We are given two statements: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" and \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat must have quanked) must also be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the splat to have quanked, meaning the splat could still exist or occur without quanking.\n4. If the splat didn't quank, and the first statement is true, then the condition (the splat being morphed) must be false.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat was not morphed.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
