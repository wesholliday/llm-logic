            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and reasoning step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P represents 'the wug was sproinged' and Q represents 'it must have been garbled.'\n2. Next, we are told that 'It's not the case that the wug must have been garbled,' which means 'it is not the case that Q.' In logical symbols, this can be represented as \u00acQ.\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged,' or P \u2192 \u00acP in logical symbols.\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if the wug were sproinged (P). According to our first statement, if the wug were sproinged, then it must have been garbled (Q). However, we know that it is not the case that the wug must have been garbled (\u00acQ). This creates a contradiction.\n5. Since having P leads to a contradiction with our given information, we can conclude that \u00acP, or 'The wug was not sproinged.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
