We are given two statements: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\" and \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the smip being shripped) is true, then the consequence (the smip must have luppped the zoint) follows.\n3. The second statement is denying that the smip must have lupped the zoint. This implies that it's possible for the smip not to have lupped the zoint.\n4. If the smip did not lupp the zoint, then the condition in the first statement cannot be true because its consequence is false.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
