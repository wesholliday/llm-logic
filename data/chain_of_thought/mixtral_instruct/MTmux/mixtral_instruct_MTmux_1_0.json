We are given the conditional statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This is known as a material implication, which means that if the antecedent (the first part, 'the flugel was blimmed') is true, then the consequent (the second part, 'the flugel must have been zargled') must also be true.\n2. Next, we are told \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\" This means that the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n3. According to the truth table for material implication, if the consequent is false, then the entire conditional statement is true only when the antecedent is also false. In other words, if 'the flugel must have been zargled' is false and our conditional statement is true, then 'the flugel was blimmed' must be false as well.\n4. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
