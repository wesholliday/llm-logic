We are given the conditional statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This is known as a material implication, which means that if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must also be true.\n2. Next, we are told \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This statement negates the consequent of our conditional statement from step 1.\n3. To infer whether or not the zinger was fraggled, let's consider two cases:\n   a) If the zinger was fraggled, then according to our conditional statement, it must have been smoogled. However, we know that this is not the case because the consequent has been negated.\n   b) Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
