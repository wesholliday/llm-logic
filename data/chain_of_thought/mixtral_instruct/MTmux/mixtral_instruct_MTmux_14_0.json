We are given the conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This is also known as a material implication, which means that if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must be true as well.\n2. We are also told that \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\" This statement negates the consequent of our conditional statement from step 1.\n3. To infer whether or not \"The clug was not fleeked,\" we need to consider the truth values of both parts of the conditional statement in light of the new information.\n4. Since the consequent is false (the clug did not have to be snugged), the only way for the entire conditional statement to be true would be if the antecedent were also false (the clug was not fleeked).\n5. Therefore, based on our reasoning and given information, we can infer that 'The clug was not fleeked.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
