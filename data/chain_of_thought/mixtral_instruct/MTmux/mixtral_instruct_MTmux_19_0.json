            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" and \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\".\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the smonk being vreebled) is true, then the consequence (the smonk must have plagged) follows.\n3. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. In other words, the consequence in our conditional statement is false.\n4. According to logic, if a conditional statement's consequence is false, then the condition must be false as well. This is known as Modus Tollens.\n5. Therefore, since the smonk not plagging implies that the smonk was not vreebled, we can indeed infer 'The smonk was not vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
