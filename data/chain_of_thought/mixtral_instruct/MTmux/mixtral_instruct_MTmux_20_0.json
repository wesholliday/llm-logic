            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This is in the form of P -> Q, where P represents 'the fleeg was bluttered' and Q represents 'it must have been surned'.\n2. Next, we are told that 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned', which means ~Q (not Q).\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered', or ~P.\n4. To do this, let's use Modus Tollens, a valid form of argument in classical logic:\n   - If P, then Q (P -> Q)\n   - Not Q (~Q)\n   -----------------\n   Therefore, not P (~P)\n5. In our given statements, we have the premises P -> Q and ~Q. By applying Modus Tollens, we can validly infer ~P, which means 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
