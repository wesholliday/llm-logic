We are given the conditional statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is known as a material implication, which means that if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must also be true.\n2. We are also told that \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\" This statement is denying that it is necessary for the fribble to have crinked. In other words, the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n3. Based on the information given, we can use modus tollens, a valid form of logical reasoning, to infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\" Modus tollens states: if p -> q (if p then q) and ~q (not q), then ~p (not p).\n4. In our case, p is 'the fribble was snurgled' and q is 'the fribble must have crinked'. Since the consequent (q) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (p) is also false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
