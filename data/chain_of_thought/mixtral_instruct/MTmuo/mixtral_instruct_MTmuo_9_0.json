            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This means that there is a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n2. Now, we are given the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. \n3. From this conditional statement alone, we cannot directly infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. We can only make conclusions based on the truth of both the condition and the result.\n4. However, since we know that there is a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, it would contradict the given conditional statement if Lisa had indeed bought the red shirt (because in that case, Mark should have bought the blue shirt).\n5. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
