We know that \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\" means that it is possible for the wolf to not be in the den.\n2. We also know that \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" is a conditional statement, which means if the antecedent (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf being in the den) must also be true.\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether the wolf was actually in the den or not. We only know that it's possible for the wolf to not be in the den.\n4. Therefore, based on this information alone, we cannot infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
