We know that \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This means that the book could be any genre except for a mystery novel.\n2. Then we are given the statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n3. From these two statements, we want to infer whether or not \"The book was not written by James.\"\n4. If the book is not a mystery novel (as stated in point 1), and if the only books that James writes are mystery novels (as stated in point 2), then it follows logically that the book could not have been written by James.\n5. Therefore, we can indeed infer 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
