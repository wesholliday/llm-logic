We know that \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This means that it is possible for the robot not to have visited Jupiter.\n2. The second statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n3. However, since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the robot not to have visited Jupiter, this implies that the condition (alien visiting Mars) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer 'The alien did not visit Mars.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
