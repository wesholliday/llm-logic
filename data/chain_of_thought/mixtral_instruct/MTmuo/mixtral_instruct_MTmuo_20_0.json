We know that \"it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n2. We also know that \"if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n3. From the first statement, we know there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. \n4. If the banana could not have been yellow, then the condition of the second statement would be false, and thus the whole statement would be false. However, since we know there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow, the second statement does not necessarily need to be false.\n5. Since the second statement can still be true even if the apple is not red (because the banana could have been some other color), we cannot infer from these statements that \"the apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
