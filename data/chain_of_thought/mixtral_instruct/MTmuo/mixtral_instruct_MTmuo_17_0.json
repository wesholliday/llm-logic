The second statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad'. \n3. From these two statements, we want to infer whether 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n4. If Ben had eaten pasta, then according to the second statement, Kate would have had to eat salad.\n5. However, from the first statement, we know that it's possible that Kate did not eat salad.\n6.
