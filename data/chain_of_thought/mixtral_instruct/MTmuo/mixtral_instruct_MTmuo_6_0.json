We know that \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This means that there is a possibility that Bob chose something other than pasta.\n2. We also know that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n3. If Sue had chosen pizza, then according to point 2, Bob would have to choose pasta. However, we know from point 1 that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta.\n4. Therefore, it cannot be true that Sue chose pizza because if she did, then Bob would have to choose pasta, but we know there's a chance he didn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
