We know that \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This means that it is possible for the cat to be inside.\n2. We also know that \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\"\n3. If the dog were inside, then according to the second statement, the cat would have to be outside.\n4. However, we already established in the first statement that it is possible for the cat to be inside.\n5. Therefore, if it's possible for the cat to be inside, the dog cannot be inside at the same time (because if the dog were inside, the cat would have to be outside).\n6. So, we can infer from these two statements that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
