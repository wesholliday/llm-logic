This means that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n2. We also know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. \n3. From these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, it follows that Mary could not have been at the wedding either. If Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have had to be there as well, but we know that there is a possibility that Sue was not there, so Mary couldn't have been there either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
