We know that \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This statement means that it is possible for the mummy to be asleep or in a state other than being awake.\n2. The second statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) follows.\n3. Given that it's possible for the mummy to be asleep or in a state other than being awake, we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake based solely on the mummy's state.\n4. Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
