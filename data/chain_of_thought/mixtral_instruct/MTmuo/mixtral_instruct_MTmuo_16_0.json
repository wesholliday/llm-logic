            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. The first statement is a negation of \"the pants must have been denim\", which means that either the pants were not denim or there is no information about the pants' material.\n2. The second statement says that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This implies that there is some sort of correlation between a cotton shirt and denim pants.\n3. However, we don't know whether the shirt is actually cotton because that information isn't provided. All we know is that if it were, then the pants would need to be denim.\n4. Since we don't have confirmation that the shirt is cotton, we cannot definitively say that the pants must be denim.\n5. Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
