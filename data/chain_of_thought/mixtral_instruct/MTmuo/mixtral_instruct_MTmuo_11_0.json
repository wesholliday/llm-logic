We know that \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n2. We also know that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n3. From these two statements, we want to determine if we can conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n4. If the cake were chocolate, then according to the second statement, the muffins would have to be blueberry.\n5. However, we know from the first statement that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n6. Therefore, it cannot be true that the cake is chocolate because if it were, the muffins would have to be blueberry, which contradicts the information given in the first statement.\n7. Thus, we can indeed infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
