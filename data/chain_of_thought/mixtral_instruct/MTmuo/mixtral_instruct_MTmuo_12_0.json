            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that 'It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.' This statement means that it is possible for Lucy not to go to the zoo.\n2. The second statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.' This is a conditional statement where the condition (Joe going to the park) leads to a consequence (Lucy going to the zoo).\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'Joe did not go to the park.' \n\nThe given information only tells us that it's possible for Lucy not to go to the zoo, but it doesn't provide any evidence about whether Joe went to the park or not. It could be the case that Joe went to the park and Lucy also went to the zoo, or it could be that Joe didn't go to the park at all. Without further information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: No.",
