    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

If Julian doesn't get the offer, it means either Priya or Diego will get it.\n3. However, we also know that it's likely Priya will get offered the role, which implies that it's unlikely Julian won't get the offer.\n4. Since it's unlikely Julian won't get the offer, this doesn't give us much information about Diego's chances of getting the offer if Priya doesn't.\n5. Therefore, we cannot determine whether it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
