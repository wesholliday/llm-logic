    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. Economists expect Tennessee to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n2. If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will have the second-highest job growth.\n3. However, we are told that Missouri's growth is significantly lower than Georgia's. So even if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs and Georgia also doesn't, it's not necessarily true that Missouri will have the highest growth. The other states could still have higher job growth than Missouri.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will likely add the most jobs.",
