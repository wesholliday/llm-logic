    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. We know that Uber is likely to have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, and then significantly fewer rides for taxis.\n2. If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, it means either Uber or taxis will have more rides than Lyft.\n3. However, we also know that Uber is likely to give the most rides, so it's unlikely that taxis would have more rides than Uber.\n4. Therefore, if Lyft doesn't give the most rides (which is likely), then Uber will have the most rides and taxis won't.\n5. The only scenario where Uber doesn't have the most rides is when they have an equal number of rides as Lyft, but since Uber is more likely to have more rides than Lyft, this scenario is unlikely.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will. In fact, it's still more likely that Uber will have the most rides even if they don't lead by a significant margin.",
