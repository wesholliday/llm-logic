    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

If Spain doesn't win, it means either Brazil or England wins.\n3. The fact that Spain is likely to win does not necessarily mean that if they don't win, England is more likely to win than Brazil. It could be the case that Brazil still has a higher chance of winning compared to England, even though Spain is more likely to win overall.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether it is likely that if Spain doesn't win, England will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
