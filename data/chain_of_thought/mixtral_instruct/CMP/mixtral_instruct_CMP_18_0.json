    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

Tacos are ordered much less frequently than both pizza and burgers.\n4. The question then asks if it's likely that, if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can't definitively say that tacos will be the top takeout item if pizza isn't. Even though burgers are the second most frequently ordered food, it's not specified how much less often tacos are ordered compared to burgers. It's possible that the difference between burgers and tacos is substantial, in which case burgers would still be more likely to be the top takeout item if pizza isn't.\n\nAnswer: No.",
