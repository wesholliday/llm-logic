    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. Coffee is expected to retain the most morning drinkers.\n2. If coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers, then either tea or soda will have more morning drinkers.\n3. We know that tea is less popular than coffee but more popular than soda in the mornings.\n4. Therefore, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, it's still more likely that tea will have more morning drinkers than soda because tea is generally more popular than soda in the mornings.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. It's still more likely that tea would have more morning drinkers than soda.",
