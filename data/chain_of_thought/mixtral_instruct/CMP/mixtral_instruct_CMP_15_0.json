    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. The stock market is expected to have the highest return, followed by real estate, with bonds having the lowest return.\n2. If real estate doesn't have the highest return, then either stocks or bonds would have the highest return.\n3. However, the statement also says that stocks are likely to have the highest return, which implies that real estate is less likely to have the highest return.\n4. But this does not necessarily mean that if stocks don't have the highest return, bonds will. It could be the case that both stocks and bonds have higher returns than real estate, but stocks still have a higher return than bonds.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will.",
