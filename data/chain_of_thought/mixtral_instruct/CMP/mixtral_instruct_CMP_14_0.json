    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": " Let's break this down step by step:\n1. We know that only one new law will be passed this session and there are three possibilities: minimum wage hike, paid family leave, or student loan forgiveness.\n2. The order of likelihood is a minimum wage hike being the most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely.\n3. If paid family leave doesn't happen (which is likely), then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n4. A minimum wage hike likely will happen, so it means that both paid family leave and student loan forgiveness are unlikely to occur.\n5. However, the information provided does not give us any new insights about the relationship between a minimum wage hike and student loan forgiveness if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will. In fact, based on the information provided, it seems more probable that neither paid family leave nor student loan forgiveness would occur if a minimum wage hike is not passed.",
