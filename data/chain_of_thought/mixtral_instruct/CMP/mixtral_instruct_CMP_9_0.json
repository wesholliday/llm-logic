    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. Apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year.\n2. Bananas are expected to be the second most popular fruit, with oranges following behind in a distant third place.\n3. If bananas aren't the top sellers, then either apples or oranges will take the first spot.\n4. However, we also know that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, which means it is unlikely for oranges to surpass both apples and bananas in sales.\n\nNow let's answer the question:\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. Since bananas are expected to have strong sales as well, there is still a good chance they would become the top seller if apples don't reach the first place.",
