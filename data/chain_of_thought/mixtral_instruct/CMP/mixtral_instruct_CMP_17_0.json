    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The doctors have given us three possibilities for the most prevalent illness this season: flu, common cold, or strep throat.\n2. They expect the flu to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind.\n3. If colds don't infect the most people, then there are two possibilities left: flu or strep.\n4. The statement \"flu likely will infect the most\" implies that it is probable that flu will be the most prevalent illness.\n5. However, if flu doesn't infect the most, then by default, strep becomes the most prevalent since colds are expected to infect fewer people than flu.\n6. Therefore, given the information provided and the expectations of the doctors, it is indeed likely that if flu doesn't infect the most, strep will be the most prevalent illness.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
