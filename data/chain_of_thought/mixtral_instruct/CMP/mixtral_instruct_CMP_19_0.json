    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": " Let's break down the given information:\n1. Rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year.\n2. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less.\n3. The only major housing costs expected to rise substantially are rents, home prices, and mortgage rates.\n4. If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n5. Rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won't increase the most.\n\nNow let's analyze the conclusion: \"Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?\"\n\nFrom point 4, we know that if home prices don't increase the most and rents also don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most. Since we are given in point 5 that rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won't increase the most, it means that both conditions from point 4 are met. Therefore, it is indeed likely that if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
