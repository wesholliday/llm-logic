    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

The industry experts project that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, and then Beyonce's album is far behind.\n2. If Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, and Taylor Swift\u2019s album also doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then it must be the case that Beyonce\u2019s album will sell the most copies.\n3. However, we are not given information about how likely or unlikely it is for Taylor Swift's album to not sell the most copies. It could be quite possible that her album does indeed sell the most copies, making the scenario where she doesn't sell the most copies less likely.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say that it is likely that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce\u2019s will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
