            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. We have two statements: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" (let's call this statement A) and \"The grommet was sploffed\" (let's call this statement B).\n2. The first statement (A) is a conditional statement, which means it has an if-then structure. In other words, it tells us that under the condition of the grommet being sploffed, the grommet plopped the frink.\n3. The second statement (B) confirms that the grommet was indeed sploffed.\n4. Given these two statements, we can apply Modus Ponens, a rule in logic that states if you have a conditional statement and its antecedent (the 'if' part), then you can infer the consequent (the 'then' part).\n5. In this case, the antecedent is \"the grommet was sploffed\" (which we know to be true from statement B), and the consequent is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n6. Therefore, since both the conditional statement A and its antecedent are true, we can infer that the consequent of statement A, \"The grommet plopped the frink,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
