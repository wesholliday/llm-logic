Given statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This is an example of a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\", where P represents 'the twonk was plinked' and Q represents 'it was varnished'.\n2. Given statement: \"The twonk was plinked.\" This is the antecedent of our conditional statement from step 1.\n3. To determine if we can infer 'It was varnished', we need to check whether the antecedent (P) is true and if so, see if it implies the consequent (Q). In this case, since the twonk was plinked, and given that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\", we can indeed infer 'It was varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
