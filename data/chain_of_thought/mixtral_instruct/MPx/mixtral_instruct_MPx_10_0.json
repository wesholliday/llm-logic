We have a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garbled\".\n2. We are given that P is true: \"The wug was sproinged.\"\n3. We want to determine if Q is true based on the given information.\n\nTo do this, we can use Modus Ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Ponens states that if P -> Q is true and P is true, then Q must be true. In our case, since we know that P is true (the wug was sproinged), and the conditional statement P -> Q is also true (if the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled), we can infer that Q is true (it was garbled).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
