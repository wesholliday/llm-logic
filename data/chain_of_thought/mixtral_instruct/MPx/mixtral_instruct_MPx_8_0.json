            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement (also known as an \"if-then\" statement): \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be written in logical notation as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the sprocket was cranked,\" and Q represents \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n2. We are also given that \"The sprocket was cranked\" (P is true).\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\" (Q is true) based on the given information.\n4. To make this inference, we need to ensure that the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and its antecedent (P) are both true. In this case, they are.\n5. Based on Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference, if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then we can infer that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
