However, just because the consequence of a conditional statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent is true as well. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy in logic.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that 'the grommet was plopped', we cannot infer from this information alone that 'the grommet was sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
