This is a conditional statement where the condition (the splat being morphed) leads to the consequence (the splat being quanked).\n3. However, just because the consequence (the splat being quanked) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the condition (the splat being morphed) is also true. There could be other reasons why the splat was quanked.\n4. Therefore, from 'The splat was quanked' and 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked', we cannot infer 'The splat was morphed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
