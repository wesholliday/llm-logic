We also know that 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is true (given information).\n3. To determine if 'The grommet was sploffed' is true, we need to see if it follows logically from the given information.\n4. The second statement tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. However, we already know from the first statement that the grommet plopped the frink regardless of whether or not it was sploffed.\n5. Therefore, knowing whether the grommet was sploffed or not does not change the fact that the grommet plopped the frink.\n6. Since we cannot infer 'The grommet was sploffed' based on the given information, there must be another possible explanation for why the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: No.",
