From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The zinger was fraggled'. \n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only tells us what happens if the zinger is fraggedled, but it doesn't tell us whether or not the zinger is actually fraggled.\n5. It could be that the zinger was smoogled for some other reason, unrelated to it being fraggled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
