And we also know that 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n\nFrom these two statements, can we infer that 'The sprocket was cranked'? Not necessarily. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only tells us what happens when the sprocket is cranked (it gets daggled). It doesn't tell us that the sprocket being daggled implies it was cranked.\n\nFor example, there could be other reasons why the sprocket is daggled besides being cranked. Without more information, we cannot definitively say that 'The sprocket was cranked'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
