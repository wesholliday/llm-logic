We also know that \"if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (from the second sentence).\n3. However, just because the splat quanked does not necessarily mean it was morphed. The second sentence only tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank. It doesn't say that morphing is required for quanking.\n4. Therefore, based on this information alone, we cannot infer that \"the splat was morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
