We also know the conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinkled.\"\n3. Our goal is to determine if we can infer that \"the fribble was snurgled\" based on this information.\n4. To do so, we need to check if the given fact (\"the fribble crinkled\") matches the consequent of our conditional statement.\n5. In this case, it does match since the consequent is also \"the fribble crinkled.\"\n6. However, just because the given fact matches the consequent, we cannot directly infer that the antecedent (\"the fribble was snurgled\") is true. This would be committing the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"the fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
