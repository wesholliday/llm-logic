In this case, the antecedent is \"the wug was sproinged\" and the consequent is \"it was garbled.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the given information supports the conclusion.\nTo determine if \"The wug was sproinged\" can be inferred, we need to check if the truth of the antecedent would guarantee the truth of the consequent in the second statement. However, all we know is that the consequent is true (the wug was garbled), but we do not have enough information about the truth value of the antecedent (whether the wug was sproinged).\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"The wug was sproinged\" based on the given information.",
