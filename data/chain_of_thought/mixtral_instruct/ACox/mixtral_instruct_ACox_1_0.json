To infer 'The flugel was blimmed', we need to show that it is true based on the given information.\n4. The second statement tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it would be zargled.\n5. Since we already know from the first statement that the flugel was indeed zargled, it's possible that it could have been blimmed as well.\n6. However, just because the flugel being blimmed leads to it being zargled, and we know the flugel is zargled, doesn't necessarily mean that the flugel was blimmed. There could be other reasons why the flugel is zargled.\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude 'The flugel was blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
