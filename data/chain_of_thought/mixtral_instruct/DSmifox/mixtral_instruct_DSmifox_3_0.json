The first statement, \"The splat might not be quanked\", implies that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked. This does not rule out the possibility that the splat could be morphed.\n3. The second statement, \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\", presents two possibilities: either the splat is quanked or it is morphed. Since we know from the first statement that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked, we can infer that the splat must be morphed in this case.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
