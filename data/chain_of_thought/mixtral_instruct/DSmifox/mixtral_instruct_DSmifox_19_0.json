The first statement, \"The smonk might not be plagged\", implies that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged. In other words, it does not confirm that the smonk is definitely plagged.\n3. The second statement, \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\", presents two possibilities for the smonk: being plagged or being vreebled.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged, we can consider the second possibility presented in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, it is possible for the smonk to be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
