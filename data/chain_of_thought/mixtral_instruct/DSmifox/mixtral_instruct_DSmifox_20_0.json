The first statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned, or in other words, it could be true that the fleeg is not surned.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This can be rephrased as \"If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\"\n3. Now, if we combine these two statements, we find that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned (statement 1), which would mean, according to statement 2, that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
