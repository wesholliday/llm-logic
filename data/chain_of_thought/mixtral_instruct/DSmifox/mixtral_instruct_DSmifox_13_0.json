This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the glip has not been tragged (or perhaps it cannot be tragged).\n2. Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This statement presents two possibilities for the glip: either it must be tragged, or it is slogged.\n\nNow let's analyze these statements to determine if we can infer that 'The glip is slogged':\n\n- The first statement does not rule out the possibility of the glip being slogged; it only states that there is a chance the glip has not been tragged.\n- The second statement offers two possibilities, one of which is that the glip is slogged.\n\nSince we have no information indicating that the first statement contradicts the second statement's possibility of the glip being slogged, and both statements allow for this possibility, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
