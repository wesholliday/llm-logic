The first statement \"The flugel might not be zargled\" implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled, which means that the flugel being zargled is not certain.\n3. Now let's consider the second statement \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\". This statement presents two possibilities: either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flugel might not be zargled, this means that the second possibility in the second statement must be true, which is \"it is blimmed\".\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
