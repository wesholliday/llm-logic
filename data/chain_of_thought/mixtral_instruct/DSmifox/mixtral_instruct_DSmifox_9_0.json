We have the statement \"The twonk might not be plinked.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must hold true: either the twonk is plinked, or it is varnished (or both).\n3. From the first statement, we know there's a possibility that the twonk is not plinked. \n4. Since the second statement only requires one condition to be met, if the twonk isn't plinked, then the other option must be true: the twonk is varnished.\n5. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
