Contrapositives have the same truth value; if a statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is valid or not.\n- Since the premise and conclusion are contrapositives, they share the same truth value. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true as well, making this form of argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
