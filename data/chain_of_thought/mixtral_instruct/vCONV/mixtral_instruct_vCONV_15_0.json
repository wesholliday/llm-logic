This is known as a contrapositive statement, which has the same truth value as the original conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\n- Since this argument follows the structure of a contrapositive statement, it is logically valid. The truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
