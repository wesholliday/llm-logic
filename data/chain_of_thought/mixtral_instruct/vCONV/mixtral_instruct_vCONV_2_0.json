This is a conditional statement and can be written as A -> B.\n2. The conclusion states that if B (unicorn) is in the forest, then A (griffin) is in the forest. This is also a conditional statement and can be written as B -> A.\n3. To determine whether this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. However, even if the griffin being in the forest implies that the unicorn is also there (A -> B), it does not necessarily mean that the presence of the unicorn implies the presence of the griffin (B -> A).\n5. Thus, the argument form is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
