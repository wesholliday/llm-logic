The given premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\" This can be represented as Q -> P.\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. In this case, swapping the hypothesis and conclusion in the original statement creates a logically equivalent statement (due to the transitive property).\n5. Therefore, if P -> Q is true, then Q -> P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
