The given premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical notation as P -> Q, where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" In logical notation, this is Q -> P.\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. Notice that in this case, swapping P and Q results in the same meaning for both statements. This is because they are contrapositives of each other.\n5. When an argument has a form where the premise and conclusion are contrapositives, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
