It means that if the first statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze whether the argument follows a logically valid pattern.\nIn this case, we can use the concept of logical equivalence to analyze the argument. Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in all possible cases. The given argument is an example of the logical equivalence between \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"Q \u2190 P\".\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether the argument is valid or not.\nSince the argument follows a logically valid pattern, it is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
