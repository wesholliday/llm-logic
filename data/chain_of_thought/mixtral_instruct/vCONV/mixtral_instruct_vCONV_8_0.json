            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The given premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of p -> q (if p, then q). Here, let p represent 'the vampire was awake' and q represent 'the mummy was awake'.\n2. The conclusion is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake,\" which is also a conditional statement but in the form of q -> p.\n3. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the premise implies the conclusion. In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n4. However, in this case, the premise and conclusion have different conditions. The premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (p -> q). But the conclusion states that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake (q -> p).\n5. Just because the truth of 'p' implies the truth of 'q', it does not mean that the truth of 'q' implies the truth of 'p'. These are two different conditional statements.\n6. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid since the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
