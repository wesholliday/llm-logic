It can be represented as \"P -> Q\", where P represents 'the book was written by James', and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n- The conclusion also has an 'if-then' structure. It can be represented as \"Q -> P\".\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument follows the rules of logical validity.\nA logically valid argument must have a conclusion that necessarily follows from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, even if the premise is true (i.e., P -> Q), it does not guarantee that the conclusion is true (Q -> P). For example, there could be mystery novels written by authors other than James. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
