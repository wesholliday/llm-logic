In other words, it is an example of the logical principle known as contrapositive.\n\nStep 3: Understand the meaning of contrapositive.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not-Q, then not-P'.\n\nStep 4: Apply the principle of contrapositive to the given argument.\nIn this case, the premise 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' can be written as 'If Alex won (finished), then Chris won (finished)'. Its contrapositive would be 'If Chris did not win (finish), then Alex did not win (finish)', which is equivalent to 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nStep 5: Compare the original conclusion with the derived contrapositive.\nThe given conclusion is 'If Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race', but it should be 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race' based on the analysis in Step 4.\n\nStep 6: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nSince the given conclusion does not match the derived contrapositive, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
