Contrapositive arguments are logically equivalent to their original forms (conditional statements).\n4. Therefore, if the original conditional statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n5. In this case, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" are contrapositives of each other.\n6. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
