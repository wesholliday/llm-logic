To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n3. In this case, the premise is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'.\n4. The conclusion is 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race'.\n5. Notice that these two statements are contrapositives of each other - they have the same meaning but express it in opposite ways.\n6. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, because they are just different ways of saying the same thing.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
