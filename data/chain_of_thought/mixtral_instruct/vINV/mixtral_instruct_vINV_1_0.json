            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The given premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~ denotes negation.\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. However, in this case, even though both statements are conditionals, they do not necessarily share a logical relationship that would make the conclusion follow from the premise.\n5. For example, it's possible for Mary to be absent from the wedding (~P) while Sue still attends (Q), which would mean the conclusion is false even if the premise were true.\n6. Therefore, the form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
