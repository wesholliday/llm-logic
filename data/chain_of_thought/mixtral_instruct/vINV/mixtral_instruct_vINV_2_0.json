The conclusion states that if not A (griffin not in the forest), then not B (unicorn not in the forest).\n3. This is an example of contrapositive reasoning, where we negate both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and reverse their order.\n4. If the premise is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n5. Therefore, if the griffin was not in the forest, it does not necessarily mean that the unicorn was not in the forest, but the argument's form is logically valid because it correctly applies contrapositive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
