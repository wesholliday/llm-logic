The given premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of p -> q, where p represents \"Sam took a plane\" and q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n2. The conclusion is \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This can be written as ~p -> ~q.\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4. In this case, the given premise and conclusion are in contrapositive form, which means they have the same truth value. If p -> q is true, then ~q -> ~p is also true, and vice versa.\n5. Therefore, if the premise (p -> q) is true, the argument's conclusion (~p -> ~q) must be logically valid as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
