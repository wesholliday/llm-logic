            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The original argument has two conditional statements (if-then sentences). Let's denote them as follows:\n   - Premise: P \u2192 Q, where P is 'the shirt was cotton', and Q is 'the pants were denim'.\n   - Conclusion: ~P \u2192 ~Q, where ~ denotes the negation.\n2. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n3. We can use a technique called contrapositive to help us with this. The contrapositive of an if-then statement swaps the hypothesis and conclusion, and negates both. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n4. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is ~Q \u2192 ~P. This means that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n5. Notice that this is equivalent to the conclusion of our argument (~P \u2192 ~Q).\n6. Since the contrapositive of the premise leads us directly to the conclusion, and both statements are true, the form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
