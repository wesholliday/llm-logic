            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The given premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the apple was red' and Q represents 'the banana was yellow'.\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\". This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~ denotes negation.\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. In this case, if P (the apple was red) implies Q (the banana was yellow), then it follows that ~P (the apple was not red) would imply ~Q (the banana was not yellow). This is because the original implication only concerned the colors of the fruit and did not specify any other conditions.\n5. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, making this form of argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
