The contrapositive of an argument swaps the hypothesis and conclusion while negating both.\n\nStep 3: Let's find the contrapositive of each statement in the original argument.\n- Original premise: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n  Contrapositive: If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n- Original conclusion: If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n  Contrapositive: If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nStep 4: Compare the contrapositives to the original argument. Notice that they are logically equivalent.\n\nStep 5: Since the contrapositive of the conclusion follows from the premise, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
