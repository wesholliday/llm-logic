This is an example of a contrapositive statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". In this case, the original statement is \"If the book was written by James (P), then the book is a mystery novel (Q)\". Its contrapositive would be \"If the book was not written by James (not P), then the book is not a mystery novel (not Q)\".\n\nStep 3: Recognize that the argument follows the structure of a valid logical form, specifically, it is in the form of a contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
