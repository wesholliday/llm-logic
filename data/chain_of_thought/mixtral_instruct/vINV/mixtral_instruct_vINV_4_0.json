            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The given argument has a conditional premise and conclusion.\n2. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to see if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n3. In this case, the premise is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'.\n4. The conclusion is 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n5. Notice that both the premise and conclusion are contrapositives of each other.\n6. If the premise is true, then it means that if the alien visited Mars, the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n7. The conclusion says that if the alien didn't visit Mars, then the robot didn't visit Jupiter.\n8. These statements are logically equivalent because they cover all possible scenarios without any contradictions.\n9. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
