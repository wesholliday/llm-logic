The conclusion is also a conditional statement: ~P -> ~Q, where ~P represents \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" and ~Q represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\".\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we can use a method called contrapositive proof.\n4. The contrapositive of P -> Q is ~Q -> ~P, which means that the conclusion and the premise are contrapositives of each other.\n5. If an argument's premises and conclusion are contrapositives, then the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
