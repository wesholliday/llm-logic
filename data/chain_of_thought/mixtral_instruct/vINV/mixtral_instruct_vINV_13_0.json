The contrapositive of an argument swaps both the hypothesis and conclusion while adding a negation to each.\n\nStep 3: Let's find the contrapositive of both statements.\n- Original premise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n- Contrapositive: If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nStep 4: Now let's look at the conclusion and its contrapositive.\n- Original conclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n- Contrapositive: If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nStep 5: Compare the original premise and the contrapositive of the conclusion. They are logically equivalent statements.\n\nStep 6: Since the argument follows a logically valid form (hypothetical syllogism), we can now answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes",
