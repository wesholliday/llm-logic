            "content": "Step 1: Identify the logical structure of the argument. The given argument follows the form of a conditional statement, also known as \"if-then\" or \"implies that\" relationship.\n\nStep 2: Write out the premise and conclusion in symbolic form to make it easier to analyze. Let P represent 'Tom watched football' and Q represent 'Jen watched basketball'. The given argument can be written as:\n\nP -> Q (if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n~P -> ~Q (if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical validity of the argument. To do this, we will use a technique called contrapositive. The contrapositive of an if-then statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nThe contrapositive of P -> Q is ~Q -> ~P (if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football).\n\nStep 4: Compare the given conclusion with the contrapositive of the premise. If they are equivalent, then the argument is logically valid. In this case, the given conclusion and the contrapositive of the premise are identical (~P -> ~Q), so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
