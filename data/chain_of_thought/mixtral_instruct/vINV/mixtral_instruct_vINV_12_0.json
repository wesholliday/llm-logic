            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The given premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'Joe went to the park' and Q represents 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\". This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~ denotes negation.\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4. In this case, the premise tells us that P implies Q (P -> Q). The conclusion tells us that not-P implies not-Q (~P -> ~Q).\n5. This relationship between the premise and conclusion is known as contrapositive reasoning, which maintains logical validity. If the original conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n6. Therefore, if the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, then the conclusion \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" necessarily follows and is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
