The contrapositive of an argument swaps the hypothesis and conclusion while negating both.\n\nStep 3: Let's find the contrapositive of each statement in the original argument.\n- Original Premise: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n  Contrapositive: If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n- Original Conclusion: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n  Contrapositive: If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nStep 4: Notice that both statements have the same contrapositive, meaning they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because its contrapositive is also a true statement.",
