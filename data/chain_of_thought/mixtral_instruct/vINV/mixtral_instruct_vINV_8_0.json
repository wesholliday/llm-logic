The given premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the vampire was awake' and Q represents 'the mummy was awake'.\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\". This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~ denotes negation (not).\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4. In this case, the premise does not provide enough information to conclude that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. It only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake, not when the vampire is not awake.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, making this form of argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
