This is an example of the contrapositive, which means that if the original statement (P -> Q) is true, then its contrapositive (~Q -> ~P) is also true.\n\n3. Therefore, if the premise 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is true, then the conclusion 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' must be logically valid as its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
