We are given the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This is known as a material implication, where if the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis,\" which means the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n3. According to the truth table for material implication, if the consequent is false, then the entire conditional statement is true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or false.\n4. However, in this case, we want to determine if we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (the antecedent being false).\n5. Since the conditional statement is true even when the antecedent is false, we cannot definitively conclude that Jeff did not play basketball based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
