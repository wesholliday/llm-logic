            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We start with the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. \n   - It can be written in logical notation as: P -> Q\n   - Here, P represents \"the apple was red,\" and Q represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The next statement is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a negation of a necessity claim. \n   - It can be written in logical notation as: ~(Q)\n   - Here, ~ represents negation.\n\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" (~P). To do this, let's use a method called proof by contradiction. \n   - We assume the opposite of what we want to prove, which is \"the apple was red\" (P), and see if it leads to a contradiction with our given statements.\n\n4. If the apple were red (P), then according to our first statement, the banana must have been yellow (Q). However, this directly contradicts our second statement, which says that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (~Q).\n\n5. Since assuming \"the apple was red\" leads to a contradiction with the given statements, we can conclude by proof by contradiction that \"the apple was not red\" (~P) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
