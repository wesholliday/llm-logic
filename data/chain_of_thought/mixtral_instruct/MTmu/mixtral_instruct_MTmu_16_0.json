            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We start with the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - Shirt (cotton) -> Pants (denim)\n\n2. The next statement given is \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This means that the consequence of our original conditional statement is false.\n   - Not: Pants (denim)\n\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these two statements. To do this, we will use a technique called proof by contradiction. \n\n4. If the shirt were cotton, then according to our first statement, the pants would have to be denim. However, we know that the pants are not denim. Therefore, if the shirt were cotton, we would have a contradiction because the pants would both be and not be denim at the same time.\n\n5. Since assuming the shirt is cotton leads to a contradiction, we must conclude that the shirt cannot be cotton. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
