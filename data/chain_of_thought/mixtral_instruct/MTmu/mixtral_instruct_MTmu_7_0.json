            "content": " Let's break down the given statements:\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"Alex \u2192 Chris.\"\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This can be written as \u00ac(Chris).\n\nNow let's analyze these statements:\n- The first statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished. In other words, there is no scenario where Alex finishes and Chris does not.\n- The second statement negates the possibility of Chris being required to finish the race. This means that it is possible for Chris not to finish the race.\n\nNow let's think about whether we can infer that Alex did not finish the race:\n- Since there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race, and the first statement tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must also finish, this implies that Alex could not have finished the race in scenarios where Chris does not finish.\n- Therefore, given both statements, it is indeed possible to infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
