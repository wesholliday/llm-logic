            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It can be written in logical notation as P -> Q, where P represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q represents \"the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n2. Next, we are told that \"it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den,\" which is the negation of statement Q. In logical notation, this can be written as ~Q.\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer \"the bear was not in the cave\" (~P) based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, we can use a logical argument called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of an \"if-then\" statement P -> Q is ~Q -> ~P. In other words, if we negate both the hypothesis and conclusion of our original conditional statement, we get a new true statement.\n5. Given that ~Q is true (the wolf was not in the den), using contrapositive reasoning, we can infer that ~P is also true (the bear was not in the cave).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
