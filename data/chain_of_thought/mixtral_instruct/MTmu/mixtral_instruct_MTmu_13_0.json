            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We start with the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. The next statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This negates the previous conditional statement's consequence. \n3. To determine if we can infer \"The car was not red,\" we need to consider whether the condition of our first statement (the car being red) could be false.\n4. If the truck is not blue, it doesn't necessarily mean that the car cannot be red. However, remember that the original statement said 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.' This means that if the car were red, the truck would have to be blue. Since we know the truck is not blue, the only way for this conditional statement to hold true is if the car is not red.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements and our reasoning, we can indeed infer \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
