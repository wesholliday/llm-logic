            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and use logical reasoning:\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is also known as a material implication or a hypothetical proposition.\n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" In other words, it is false that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt.\n3. Now let's analyze this information using logical reasoning:\n   a. If the conditional statement were true (i.e., \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"), and it is also true that \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" then we have a contradiction.\n   b. A contradiction means that both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n   c. Since we know that the second statement is true (it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt), the first statement must be false.\n   d. If the first statement is false, then its negation (\"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
