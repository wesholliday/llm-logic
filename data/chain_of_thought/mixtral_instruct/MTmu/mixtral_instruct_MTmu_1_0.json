            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: Mary \u2192 Sue\n2. The second statement tells us that Sue may not have been at the wedding: \u00ac(Sue)\n3. Now, let's analyze these statements using logical principles. If the antecedent (Mary) of a conditional statement is false, then the entire statement becomes true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Sue). This principle is known as Modus Tollens.\n4. Since we know that Sue may not have been at the wedding, it's possible to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding either, making the conditional statement true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
