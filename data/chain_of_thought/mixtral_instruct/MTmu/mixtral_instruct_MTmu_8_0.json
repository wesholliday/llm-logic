            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\". \n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" In other words, the mummy could not have been awake, which can be represented as \"not q\".\n3. To determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake,\" or \"not p\", we need to apply logical reasoning. Specifically, we are looking for a situation where if \"not q\" is true, then \"not p\" must also be true.\n4. In this case, the given statement is a conditional statement, and its truth table shows that when \"not q\" is true (meaning the mummy could not have been awake), \"not p\" (the vampire was not awake) will also be true, regardless of whether the vampire could or could not have been awake.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and applying logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
