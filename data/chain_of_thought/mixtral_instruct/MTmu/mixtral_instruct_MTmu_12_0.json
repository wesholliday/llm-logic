We are given the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is also known as a material implication, which is true unless the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is true and the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) is false.\n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This means that the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n3. Since the conditional statement is a material implication, and its consequent is false, we can infer that the entire conditional statement is false.\n4. A false conditional statement can only occur if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false (a situation known as a counterexample). Therefore, for our given conditional statement to be false, Joe must have gone to the park (antecedent), but Lucy did not go to the zoo (contradicting the consequent).\n5. Given that the entire conditional statement is false because its antecedent is true and its consequent is false, we can indeed infer \"Joe did not go to the park.\" However, this inference is incorrect based on our reasoning above.\n\nNow that you have thought through it step by step, here's your answer:\nAnswer: No.",
