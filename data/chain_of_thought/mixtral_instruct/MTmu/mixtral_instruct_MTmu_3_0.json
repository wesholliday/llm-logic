            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and examine their logical relationships:\n\n1. Given statement: If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This is an example of a conditional statement, often represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book must be a mystery novel'.\n2. Given statement: It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This can be translated to 'not Q', or in other words, 'the book is not a mystery novel'.\n3. We want to determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', which is represented as 'not P'.\n4. To establish this relationship, we can use the concept of contrapositive, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is logically equivalent to \"not Q \u2192 not P\". In our case, this means that if 'the book is not a mystery novel' (not Q), then 'the book was not written by James' (not P).\n5. Since we are given that 'the book is not a mystery novel' (not Q), using the contrapositive relationship, we can indeed infer that 'the book was not written by James' (not P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
