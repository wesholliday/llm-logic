We are given the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This is also known as a material implication, and it can be symbolized as P -> Q, where P represents 'Sam took a plane' and Q represents 'Erin must have taken a train.'\n2. We are also given that \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train,\" which is the negation of Q (\u00acQ).\n3. To determine if we can infer 'Sam did not take a plane' (\u00acP), let's examine the possible scenarios:\n   - If Sam took a plane (P), then, according to our conditional statement, Erin must have taken a train (Q). However, we know that \u00acQ, so this scenario is impossible.\n   - Therefore, Sam cannot have taken a plane (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
