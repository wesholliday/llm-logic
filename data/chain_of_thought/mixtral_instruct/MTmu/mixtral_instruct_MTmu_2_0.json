We are given the conditional statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is also known as a material implication, where if the antecedent (griffin in the forest) is true, then the consequent (unicorn in the forest) must be true.\n2. Next, we are told that \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n3. According to the truth table for material implication, if the consequent is false, then the entire conditional statement is true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or false. However, this doesn't help us determine whether the griffin was in the forest.\n4. To infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we would need additional information linking the absence of the unicorn directly to the absence of the griffin. The given statements do not provide such a connection.\n\nAnswer: No.",
