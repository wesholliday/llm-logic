            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We start with the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - In logic notation, we can write this as P -> M, where P represents 'the doll was plastic' and M represents 'the truck was metal.'\n2. The next statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This means that the truck could be made of some material other than metal. \n   - In logic notation, we can write this as ~(M), where ~ denotes 'not.'\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from these two statements. To do this, we'll assume the opposite of what we want to prove and see if it leads to a contradiction. \n   - The opposite of \"The doll was not plastic\" is \"The doll was plastic,\" which we can represent as P.\n4. If the doll is plastic (P), then according to our first statement, the truck must be metal (M). However, this contradicts our second statement that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal (~(M)).\n5. Since assuming \"The doll was plastic\" leads to a contradiction, we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
