We are given the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This is also known as a material implication, where if the antecedent (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob choosing pasta) must be true.\n2. Next, we are told that it's not the case that \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This means that the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n3. According to the truth table for material implication, if the consequent is false, then the entire conditional statement is true only when the antecedent is also false.\n4. Therefore, since the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is true and its consequent is false, it follows that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
