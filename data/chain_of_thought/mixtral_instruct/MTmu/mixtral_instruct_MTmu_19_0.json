            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We start with the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - In logic notation, this would be written as P -> Q, where P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The next statement is \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that Jen did not watch basketball.\n   - In logic notation, this would be written as ~Q.\n\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from these two statements. \n   - In logic notation, this would be written as ~P.\n\n4. From the second statement, we know that Jen did not watch basketball (~Q). \n\n5. If Jen did not watch basketball (~Q), then according to the first statement, Tom could not have watched football (~P). \n   - This is because the first statement was an \"if-then\" statement where the condition (Tom watching football) did not occur. Therefore, the consequence (Jen watching basketball) also does not occur.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that Tom did not watch football from these two statements.",
