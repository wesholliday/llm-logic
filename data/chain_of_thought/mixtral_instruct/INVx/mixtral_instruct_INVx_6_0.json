This can be represented as S -> P.\n\nNow, we want to determine if the converse of this statement is true:\n\n2. If the grommet did not plop the frink (~P), then the grommet was not sploffed (~S).\n\nTo do this, let's consider two cases for whether the grommet was sploffed or not:\n\nCase 1: The grommet was sploffed (S). According to our original statement, if the grommet is sploffed, then it plops the frink (P). So, in this case, both S and P are true.\n\nCase 2: The grommet was not sploffed (~S). In this case, we don't have enough information to determine whether or not the grommet plopped the frink. It could be that the grommet didn't plop the frink because it wasn't sploffed, but it could also be that the grommet plopped the frink for some other reason.\n\nSince we cannot definitively say that if the grommet did not plop the frink (~P), then the grommet was not sploffed (~S), we cannot infer the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
