If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nThis can be represented as: Vreebled(smonk) \u2192 Plagged(smonk)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is:\n\n\u00acPlagged(smonk) \u2192 \u00acVreebled(smonk)\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the given information and see if it allows us to make such an inference. The original statement only tells us what happens when a smonk is vreebled; however, it does not provide any information about what happens when a smonk is not vreebled. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that if the smonk was not vreebled, then it was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: No.",
