If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\n   This is in the form of P -> Q (If P, then Q) where P represents 'the dreb was vroombed' and Q represents 'the dreb was spened'.\n\nNow let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n2. If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\n   This is in the form of ~P -> ~Q (If not P, then not Q) where ~P represents 'the dreb was not vroombed' and ~Q represents 'the dreb was not spened'.\n\nTo infer statement 2 from statement 1, we need to apply logical reasoning. However, statement 1 alone does not allow us to directly infer statement 2 because it only establishes a connection between P and Q, but not between ~P and ~Q. We would need more information about the relationship between vroombed and spened to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
