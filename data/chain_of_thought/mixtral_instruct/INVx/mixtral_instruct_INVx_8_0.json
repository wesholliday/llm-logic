            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\". This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\". \n2. The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\", or in symbols, ~Q -> ~P.\n3. If we want to infer the contrapositive from the original statement, we need to make sure that the original statement is true whenever its hypothesis (P) is true and its conclusion (Q) is true. This is called logical sufficiency.\n4. In this case, if the sprocket was cranked (P), then it was daggled (Q). However, we don't have enough information to determine whether the sprocket being daggled always implies that the sprocket was cranked. It could be that there are other ways for the sprocket to become daggled besides cranking it.\n5. Therefore, since we cannot confirm logical sufficiency, we cannot infer the contrapositive statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No.",
