If the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved (movated).\n   This can be represented as: Skizzled(flob) \u2192 Movated(flob)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is:\n\n\u00acMovated(flob) \u2192 \u00acSkizzled(flob)\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the given information and see if it supports this inference. The original statement only tells us what happens when the flob is skizzled (it moves), but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the flob is not skizzled. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that if the flob was not skizzled, then it was not movated.\n\nAnswer: No.",
