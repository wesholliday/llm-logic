            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This is in the form of p -> q, where p represents \"the smip was shripped\" and q represents \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n2. The given information does not provide any counterexample to the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" or ~q -> ~p.\n3. To infer \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint,\" we need to establish the truth of its contrapositive: \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped\" or q -> p.\n4. However, the given information only allows us to make inferences about the relationship between shripping and lupping the zoint when the smip is shripped, not when it isn't.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
