The given statement is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This can be represented as: Blummed(flug) -> Zimmed(flug).\n2. We want to determine if we can infer \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed,\" which can be represented as: !Blummed(flug) -> !Zimmed(flug).\n3. The given statement only tells us about the relationship between being blummed and zimmed when a flug is blummed. It does not provide any information about what happens when a flug is not blummed.\n4. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that if a flug is not blummed, it is also not zimmed based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
