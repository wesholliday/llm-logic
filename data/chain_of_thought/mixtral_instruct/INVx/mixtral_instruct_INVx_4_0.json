            "content": " To answer this question, let's first understand the given statement:\n\nGiven: If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\". It does not explicitly state what happens when the condition (P) is not met. To infer the truth of the statement \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\", we need to consider whether this statement logically follows from the given information.\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is true, let's examine two possible scenarios:\n\n1) The fribble was snurgled: According to the given statement, if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinkled. So, in this case, the fribble both was snurgled and crinked.\n\n2) The fribble was not snurgled: In this scenario, we don't have any direct information about what happens when the fribble is not snurgled. However, since there is no information suggesting that the fribble must crinkle regardless of whether it is snurgled or not, we cannot assume that the fribble crinkled in this situation.\n\nBased on our analysis, the statement \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" does seem to logically follow from the given information. However, it is essential to note that this inference assumes that there are no other factors or conditions affecting whether the fribble crinkles.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
