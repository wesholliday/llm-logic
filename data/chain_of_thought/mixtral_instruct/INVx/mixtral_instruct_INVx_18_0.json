            "content": " To answer this question, let's first understand the given statement:\n\nGiven: If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nThis is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, where the first part (the shank was plooked) is called the antecedent and the second part (the shank was nugged) is called the consequent. The entire statement can be written as:\n\nplooked(shank) \u2192 nugged(shank)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement swaps the antecedent and consequent and negates both parts. It's important to note that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nThe contrapositive of our given statement would be:\n\n\u00acnugged(shank) \u2192 \u00acplooked(shank)\n\nThis translates to \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTo determine if this is true, we need more information about the relationship between plooking and nugging a shank. However, based on the given statement alone, we cannot definitively say whether or not the contrapositive is true. We can only conclude that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: We cannot determine this without more information about the relationship between plooking and nugging a shank. However, if the given statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.",
