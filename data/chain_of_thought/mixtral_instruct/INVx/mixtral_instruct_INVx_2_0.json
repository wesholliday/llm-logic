If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nThis can be represented as: flooped(wug) \u2192 bimmed(wug, zoint)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is:\n\n\u00acbimmed(wug, zoint) \u2192 \u00acflooped(wug)\n\nTo do this, let's analyze the given information and see if it supports this inference. The original statement tells us that whenever a wug is flooped, it bims the zoint. However, there is no information provided about what happens when a wug is not flooped. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that a non-flooped wug will not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: No.",
