            "content": " To answer this question, let's first clarify the given conditional statement:\n\nPremise: If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nWe can represent this premise using logical symbols as follows:\nCrampled(sneg) \u2192 Sprouted(sneg, frink)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the following statement is logically valid:\n\nConclusion: If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nWe can represent this conclusion using logical symbols as follows:\n\u00acCrampled(sneg) \u2192 \u00acSprouted(sneg, frink)\n\nTo determine if the conclusion is valid, we will use a technique called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement swaps the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nThe contrapositive of our premise is:\n\u00acSprouted(sneg, frink) \u2192 \u00acCrampled(sneg)\n\nThis contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the conclusion we want to test. Since the original premise (Crampled(sneg) \u2192 Sprouted(sneg, frink)) is true, its contrapositive (\u00acSprouted(sneg, frink) \u2192 \u00acCrampled(sneg)) must also be true. Therefore, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
