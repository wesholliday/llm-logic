However, this does not mean that we can directly infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nThe given statement only tells us about the relationship between blimming and zargling when the flugel is blimmed. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
