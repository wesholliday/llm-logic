(Let's denote this as P -> Q)\n\nNow let's consider the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement:\n\n2. If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered. (~Q -> ~P)\n\nWe can rewrite this statement as:\n\n3. If the fleeg did not surn, then it did not surn and it was not bluttered. (~Q -> ~Q & ~P)\n\nNow let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n4. If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn. (~P -> ~Q)\n\nTo determine if statement 4 can be inferred from statement 1, let's compare their structures. Statement 4 has the same structure as statement 2, which is logically equivalent to statement 1. Therefore, we can infer statement 4 from statement 1.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
