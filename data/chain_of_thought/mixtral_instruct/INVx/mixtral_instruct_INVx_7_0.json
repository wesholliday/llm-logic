(Shanking may cause a tinking sound)\n\nNow let's consider the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement:\n\n2. If the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked. (No tinking implies no shanking)\n\nThe given statement and its contrapositive are both true if we assume that shanking always results in tinking. However, the given statement does not explicitly state that shanking is the only cause for tinking. If there are other possible causes of tinking, then the original statement and its contrapositive might not be logically equivalent.\n\nTo answer your question directly:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink' because there could be other causes for tinking that are unrelated to shanking.",
