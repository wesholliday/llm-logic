            "content": " Let's break down the given statement first:\n\n1. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" - This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if-then\". It means that morphing the splat leads to quanking.\n\nNow let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n2. \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" - This is also a conditional statement and it states that if the splat isn't morphed, then it doesn't quank.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer statement 2 from statement 1, let's think about what these statements imply:\n\n- Statement 1 tells us that morphing the splat results in quanking. It does not tell us anything about what happens when the splat is not morphed.\n- Statement 2 assumes that if the splat isn't morphed, then it doesn't quank. This might be true, but statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to conclude this. Maybe there are other ways for the splat to quank besides being morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer statement 2 from statement 1 based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
