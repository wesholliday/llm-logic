The given statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, where the first part (the 'if' clause) is called the antecedent and the second part (the 'then' clause) is called the consequent.\n2. In this case, the antecedent is \"the zinger was fraggled,\" and the consequent is \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n3. The statement does not provide any information about what happens when the antecedent is false (i.e., when the zinger is not fraggled).\n4. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it was not smoogled. This would be assuming that the statement is biconditional, which is not given or implied.\n5.
