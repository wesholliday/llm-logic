We know that the notebook must either be on the nightstand or in the drawer, because those are the only two possible locations mentioned.\n2. Then we are told that it might not be on the nightstand. This means that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in its first possible location.\n3. However, just because something isn't true for one possibility doesn't mean it must be true for the other possibility. In this case, just because the notebook might not be on the nightstand, we cannot automatically assume it must be in the drawer.\n4. It could also be that the notebook is neither on the nightstand nor in the drawer. Without more information, we cannot definitively say where the notebook is.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on the given statements.",
