We are also told that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nNow let's analyze the possibilities:\n- If the watch is not on his wrist, then according to the first statement, it must be charging on the dresser.\n- Since we know that the watch might not be on his wrist, there is a possibility that it is indeed charging on the dresser.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser because there could be other possibilities where the watch is neither on his wrist nor charging on the dresser. For example, the watch might be in another room or with someone else. So while it's possible that the watch is charging on the dresser, we cannot infer it conclusively based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
