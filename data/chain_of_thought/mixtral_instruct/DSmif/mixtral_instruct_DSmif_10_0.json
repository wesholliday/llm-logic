We have two possible locations for the missing sock: under the bed or in the laundry basket (exclusive disjunction).\n2. The negation is introduced: \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, we need to examine whether this conclusion follows validly from our premises using logical reasoning principles such as Modus Tollens or Disjunctive Syllogism.\n4. In this case, since there are only two possible locations for the missing sock and one location has been ruled out, we can apply Disjunctive Syllogism to draw a conclusion about the remaining location.\n5. Disjunctive Syllogism states that if either P or Q is true, and it is not P, then Q must be true.\n6. Here, our possible locations are 'under the bed' (P) and 'in the laundry basket' (Q). Since we know that 'the missing sock isn't under the bed' (not P), we can infer that 'the missing sock is in the laundry basket' (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
