We have two statements: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" and \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\".\n2. The first statement presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece - either it is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n3. The second statement confirms that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, thus eliminating one of the possibilities presented in the first statement.\n4. Since we now know that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, and based on the given information, there are no other possible locations mentioned, we can infer that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
