Then we are told that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, which implies it's possible that they aren't on her head.\n3. Since it is possible that the sunglasses are not on her head, and since there is no other option given for where they could be, it follows logically that they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
