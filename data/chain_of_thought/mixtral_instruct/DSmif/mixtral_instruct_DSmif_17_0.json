The statement 'Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack' presents two possibilities for the location of the scarf - on the coat rack or in the backpack.\n2. The second statement, 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack', indicates that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the scarf is in the backpack. It could also mean that the scarf is simply not present in either location mentioned.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
