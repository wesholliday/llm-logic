We have two possible locations for the cookies: the pantry or the jar (exclusive OR).\n2. The second statement tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n3. Since there is no other place mentioned where the cookies could be, and they cannot be in the pantry, it follows logically that they must be in the jar.\n4. This inference is based on eliminating one of the two possibilities and assuming that only the remaining option is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
