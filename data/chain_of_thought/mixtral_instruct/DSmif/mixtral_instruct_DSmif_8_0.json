We are given a statement: \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\" This statement presents two possible locations for the remote control - one of which must be true.\n2. Next, we are told that \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\" This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the initial statement.\n3. Since the remote control is not hiding under the couch, it can only be on the coffee table based on the original statement.\n4. Therefore, with this information, we can indeed infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
