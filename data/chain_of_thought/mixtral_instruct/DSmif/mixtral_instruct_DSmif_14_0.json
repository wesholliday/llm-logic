The statement 'Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter' presents two possibilities for the location of the milk.\n2. The statement 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' indicates that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not explicitly state where the milk is if it's not in the fridge.\n3. From these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The milk is on the counter'. It could be on the counter, or it could be somewhere else entirely (like in a cupboard or taken by someone).\n\nAnswer: No.",
