The statement 'Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car' represents an \"exclusive or\" situation, meaning only one of these options can be true at a time.\n3. We are given that 'The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet'.\n4. Since we know that the umbrella cannot be in both locations and it is not in the closet, then by process of elimination, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
