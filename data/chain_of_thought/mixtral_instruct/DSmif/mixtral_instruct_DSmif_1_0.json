This is a logical statement called a disjunction, which means one part or the other must be true.\n2. Then we are told that it might not be the case that Fido is in the garden. \n3. If it's possible for Fido to not be in the garden, then the only remaining possibility from our initial statement is that Fido is inside.\n4. Therefore, based on this information, we can indeed infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
