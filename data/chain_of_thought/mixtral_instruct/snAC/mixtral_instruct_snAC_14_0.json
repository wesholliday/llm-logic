This information tells us two things: (a) If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den; (b) The wolf was indeed in the den.\n3. However, it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave. It could be true, but we cannot conclude it based on the given information alone.\n4. To illustrate this point, consider a situation where the bear wasn't in the cave but somewhere else while the wolf was in the den. In this case, both statements (a) and (b) would still hold true, even though 'The bear was in the cave' is false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
