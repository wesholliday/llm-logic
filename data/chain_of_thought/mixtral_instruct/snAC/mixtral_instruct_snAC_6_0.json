We also know that Bob chose pasta (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only infer that *if* Sue chose pizza, *then* Bob chose pasta. However, it doesn't mean that Sue necessarily chose pizza. It could be the case that Bob chose pasta for some other reason not related to Sue's choice.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say whether Sue chose pizza or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
