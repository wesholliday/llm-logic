We know that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true (let's call this statement A).\n2. We also know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true (let's call this statement B).\n3. Now we want to determine if 'The book was written by James' is true based on statements A and B.\n4. To do this, we need to consider whether the truth of statement B implies the truth of statement A.\n5. However, just because the book is a mystery novel (B), it doesn't necessarily mean that James wrote it (A). There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n6. Therefore, even though we know both statements A and B are true individually, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
