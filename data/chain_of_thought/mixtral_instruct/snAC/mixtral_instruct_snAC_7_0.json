We are given that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. However, just because Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex was the one who finished the race. There could be other factors at play where someone else besides Alex could have finished the race and Chris still finishes his race.\n4. Therefore, even though we know Chris finished the race, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race as well based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
