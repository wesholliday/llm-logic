However, it does not necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n- In other words, there could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry (e.g., someone just felt like making blueberry muffins).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether 'The cake was chocolate' is true based on the given information\n- Since we only know that the muffins were blueberry and there is no direct relationship between this fact and the cake being chocolate, we cannot conclude that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No.",
