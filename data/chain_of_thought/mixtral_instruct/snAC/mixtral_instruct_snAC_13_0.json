In this case, if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n- Statement B is a simple declarative statement that asserts the truth of its content: the truck was blue.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether 'The car was red' follows necessarily from the given information\n- To find out if 'The car was red' (let's call this statement C) is true, we need to examine the relationship between statements A and B.\n- Since statement B (the truck was blue) is true, it does not automatically mean that statement A is also true. It could be that the truck being blue has nothing to do with the car's color.\n- However, even if statement A were true, having a true consequent (truck being blue) does not guarantee a true antecedent (car being red). This relationship is known as 'affirming the consequent,' which is a fallacy and does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that statement C is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
