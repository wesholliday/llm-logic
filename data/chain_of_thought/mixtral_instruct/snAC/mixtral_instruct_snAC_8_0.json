            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. We know that 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is true. This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothesis or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We also know that 'The mummy was awake' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The vampire was awake' is necessarily true, we need to consider whether the conditions set out in our first statement (the 'if-then' statement) have been met.\n4. In this case, the condition for the vampire being awake is not explicitly stated - it only says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy will be too.\n5. However, just because the mummy is awake, we cannot automatically assume that the vampire must also be awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake that don't involve the vampire being awake as well.\n\nAnswer: No.",
