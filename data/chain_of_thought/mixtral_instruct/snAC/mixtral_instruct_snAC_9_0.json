We also know that Mark bought the blue shirt (let's call this statement B).\n3. The question asks whether it necessarily follows that Lisa bought the red shirt (let's call this statement C).\n4. To determine if C is true, we can use a logical argument called modus ponens: if A is true and \"if A then C\" is true, then C must be true.\n5. However, in our case, we only know that B is true, not C. \n6. While it's possible that Lisa bought the red shirt (and thus A is true), we cannot conclude this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
