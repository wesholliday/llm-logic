However, this does not necessarily mean that 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' (A \u2192 B) is true because of the possibility that there is no connection between the two statements.\n- Since we don't have enough information to confirm that A is true or false, we cannot definitively say that 'The apple was red' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
