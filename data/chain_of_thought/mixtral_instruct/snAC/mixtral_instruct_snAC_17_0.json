This is known as Modus Ponens in logic.\n- However, in this case, we don't have information about whether Ben ate pasta (P) or not.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n- We cannot determine if Ben ate pasta based on the given information. It might be true that he did, but it's also possible that he didn't, for example, if Kate ate salad for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: No.",
