We also know that Erin took a train (let's call this statement B).\n3. The question asks whether it necessarily follows that Sam took a plane (let's call this statement C).\n4. To determine if C is true, we can use the logical rule called \"modus ponens,\" which states that from A and \"if A then C,\" we can infer C.\n5. However, in our case, we only know that \"if A then C\" (statement 1) and \"B\" (statement 2). We don't have direct evidence for statement C itself.\n6. Therefore, while it is possible that Sam took a plane, we cannot conclude with certainty that he did based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
