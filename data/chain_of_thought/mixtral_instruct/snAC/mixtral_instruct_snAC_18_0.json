            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true. This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We are also given that 'The truck was metal' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The doll was plastic' is necessarily true, we need to consider whether the given information satisfies the condition in our first statement.\n4. In this case, the condition is 'If the doll was plastic'. Since we don't have any information that contradicts this possibility, it remains a valid scenario based on the given information.\n5. However, just because the doll could be plastic doesn't mean it has to be. There might be other possibilities in which the truck is metal but the doll isn't plastic.\n6. Therefore, while 'The doll was plastic' is possible, it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
