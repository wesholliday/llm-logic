We have the statement \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\" This negates the first part of the original statement.\n3. Since the second statement denies that the zinger must be smoogled, it implies that the zinger can be in some other state or condition.\n4. The only other option given in the original statement is that \"it is fraggled.\"\n5. Therefore, based on the two statements provided, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
