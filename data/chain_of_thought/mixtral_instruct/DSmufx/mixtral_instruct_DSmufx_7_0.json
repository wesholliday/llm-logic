We have the statement \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\" This negates the first part of the disjunction from step 1.\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction has been negated, it necessarily follows that the second part of the disjunction, \"it is shanked,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
