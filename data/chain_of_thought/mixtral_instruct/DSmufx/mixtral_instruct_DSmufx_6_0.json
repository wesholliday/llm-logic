We have the statement \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\" This means that at least one of these two conditions is true.\n2. Then we are told \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This negates the first part of the previous statement, meaning that the grommet does not need to be plopped.\n3. Now we can infer that since it's not necessary for the grommet to be plopped and at least one of the conditions in the original statement must be true, it follows that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
