We have the statement \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" In other words, the negation of \"the splat must be quanked\" is true. This implies that the splat does not have to be quanked.\n3. Now, going back to our first statement, since we know that \"it's not the case that the splat must be quanked,\" then it must be the case that \"the splat is morphed.\"\n4. To confirm, if the splat doesn't have to be quanked, and one of the two options (quanked or morphed) must be true, then the only remaining option is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
