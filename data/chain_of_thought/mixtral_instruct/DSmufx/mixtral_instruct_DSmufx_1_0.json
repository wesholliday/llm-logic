We have the statement \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\" This negates the first part of the original statement.\n3. Since the first part of the original statement has been negated, and there are no other conditions or statements provided, it follows that the second part of the original statement must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
