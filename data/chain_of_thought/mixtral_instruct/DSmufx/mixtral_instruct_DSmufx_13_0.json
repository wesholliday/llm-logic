We have the statement \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This negates the first part of the initial disjunction.\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction has been negated, it necessarily follows that the second part of the disjunction, \"it is slogged,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
