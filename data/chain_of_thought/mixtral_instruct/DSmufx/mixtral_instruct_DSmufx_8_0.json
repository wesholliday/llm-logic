We are given two statements: \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" and \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\"\n2. The first statement can be rephrased as \"If the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\" This is because if there are only two options (daggled or cranked), and one of them is false, then the other must be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the sprocket to be daggled, which means that the sprocket can still be in the other state: cranked.\n4. Based on this information, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
