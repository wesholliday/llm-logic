We have the statement \"Either the smimp must be lupped or it is shripped.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the smimp must be lupped.\" This negates the first part of the first statement.\n3. Since the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the smimp must be lupped, we can infer that the first part of the first statement is false.\n4. As a result, since the logical disjunction in the first statement requires at least one true statement, and we now know that the first part is false, the second part \"it is shripped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
