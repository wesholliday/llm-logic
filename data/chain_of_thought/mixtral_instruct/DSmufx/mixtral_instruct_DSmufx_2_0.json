We have the statement \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of its two parts must be true.\n2. Then we are told \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\" This negates the first part of the previous statement, meaning the second part must be true.\n3. Therefore, since the second part of the initial disjunction, \"it is flooped,\" is the only remaining possibility and it has been determined to be true, we can indeed infer that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
