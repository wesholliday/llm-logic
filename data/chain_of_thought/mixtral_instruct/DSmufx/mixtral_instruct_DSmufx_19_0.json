We have the statement \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\" This negates the first part of the first statement, meaning that the smonk does not have to be plagged.\n3. Since the second statement denies that the smonk must be plagged, it implies that the smonk can be in some other state.\n4. The only other option given for the smonk's state is \"it is vreebled.\"\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided and assuming there are no other possible states for the smonk, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
