We have the statement \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of its two parts must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\" This negates the first part of the initial disjunction.\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction has been negated, it means that the second part must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
