We have the statement \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" In other words, it is false that the fribble must be crinkled. This implies that the fribble can possibly be uncrinkled.\n3. Now, let's consider the original disjunction in light of this new information. Since it's not true that the fribble must be crinked, the only remaining option is that \"it is snurgled.\"\n4. Therefore, based on our reasoning, we can infer 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
