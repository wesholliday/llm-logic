We have the statement \"Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This negates the necessity of plinking the twonk.\n3. Since we know that at least one of the disjuncts in the first statement must be true, and the second statement tells us that the twonk cannot necessarily be plinked, it follows that the only remaining option is for the twonk to be varnished.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
