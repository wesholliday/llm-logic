We have the statement \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement given is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This negates the first part of the original statement.\n3. Since we know that the first part of the original statement (\"the fleeg must be surned\") is false (because it has been negated), then by the law of excluded middle, the second part of the original statement (\"it is bluttered\") must be true.\n4. Therefore, based on this logical reasoning, we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
