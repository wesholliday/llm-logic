We have two statements: \"Either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed\" and \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spent.\"\n2. The second statement implies that there is no obligation for the dreb to be spent.\n3. Now let's consider the first statement, \"Either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed.\" Since we know from the second statement that the dreb doesn't have to be spent, the only remaining option in the first statement is that \"it is vroombed.\"\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and applying logical reasoning, we can infer 'The dreb is vroombed.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
