We have the statement \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" is true. This negates the first part of the original statement.\n3. Since the first part of the original statement is false, it must mean that the second part, \"it is crampled,\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
