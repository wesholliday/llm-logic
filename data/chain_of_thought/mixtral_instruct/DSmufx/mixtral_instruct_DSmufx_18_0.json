We have the statement \"Either the shank must be nuggled or it is plooked.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\" In other words, it is false that the shank must be nuggled.\n3. Since the first statement is a disjunction and the second part of the disjunction has been shown to be false, then the first part must be true. Therefore, the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
