(Statement B)\n\nStep 2: Analyze Statement A. It provides two possibilities for the glip: being slogged or having to be tragged. 'Either...or' indicates that one of these conditions must be true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Statement B. It suggests that there is a possibility that the glip is not in the state of being tragged. This does not necessarily mean that the glip cannot be tragged, only that it might not be.\n\nStep 4: Based on Statement A, if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. Since Statement B tells us that there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged, we can infer that 'The glip is slogged' is a possibility.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude 'The glip is slogged' because Statement B does not rule out the possibility of the glip being tragged, only that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: No.",
