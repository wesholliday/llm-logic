We also know that the whiffle might not be tinked. This implies that it's possible for the whiffle to not be tinked.\n3. If it's possible for the whiffle to not be tinked, then the second part of our first statement (it must be tinked) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, if the second part of our first statement is not true, then by the law of excluded middle, the first part (the whiffle is shanked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
