We have the statement \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\" This means that if the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged.\n2. The second statement is \"The shank might not be nugged.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the shank is not in the state of being nugged.\n3. If the shank might not be nugged, then according to the first statement, it must be plooked because if it's not one, it has to be the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
