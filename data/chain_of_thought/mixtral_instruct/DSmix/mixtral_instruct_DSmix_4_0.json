We have the statement \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This means that there are only two possibilities for the fribble: either it is snurgled, or it must be crinked (with no other options).\n2. Then we have the statement \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This implies that being un-crinked is a possibility for the fribble.\n3. Now let's consider these two statements together: If the fribble has the possibility of not being crinkled, then it cannot be true that the fribble must be crinkled (because 'must' implies certainty).\n4. Since there are only two possibilities for the fribble, and one of them (being crinked) is now in question, the remaining option (the fribble being snurgled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
