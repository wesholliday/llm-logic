This statement suggests that if the flug is not blummed, then it has to be zimmed.\n- The flug might not be zimmed. This statement indicates that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements and think about what they imply together. If the flug might not be zimmed, then it means that it could be blummed since if it were not blummed, it would have to be zimmed (from the first statement). Since there is a possibility that it is not zimmed, we can infer that it is more likely to be blummed.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes",
