We have the statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This means that there are only two possibilities for the sprocket - it is either cranked or needs to be daggled.\n2. The second statement is \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\" This implies that the possibility of the sprocket not being daggled exists, which could mean that it is in a state other than daggled.\n3. Since there are only two possibilities for the sprocket (as per the first statement), and one of those possibilities is now known to be true (the sprocket might not be daggled), then by process of elimination, the remaining possibility must be true.\n4. Therefore, if the sprocket might not be daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
