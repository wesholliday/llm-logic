We have the statement \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"The twonk might not be plinked.\" This means that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked.\n3. If it's possible for the twonk to not be plinked, then the second part of the first statement (\"it must be plinked\") cannot be true.\n4. Since one part of the disjunction in the first statement must be true, and we now know that the second part is false, it follows that the first part of the disjunction (\"the twonk is varnished\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
