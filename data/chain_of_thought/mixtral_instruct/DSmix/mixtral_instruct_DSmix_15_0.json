We have the statement \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\" This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"The dreb might not be spened.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the dreb is not spened.\n3. To infer whether the dreb is vroombed or not, let's consider both possibilities:\n   a) If the dreb is not spened, then according to the first statement, it must be vroombed since one of the conditions has to be true.\n   b) Since we know from the second statement that there is a possibility that the dreb is not spened, we can infer based on this information alone that the dreb is indeed vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
