We have the statement \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\" This means that if the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled.\n2. The second statement is \"The zinger might not be smoogled.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled.\n3. If the zinger might not be smoogled, then according to the first statement, it must be fraggled.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
