We have the statement \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" This means that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n2. The second statement is \"The flugel might not be zargled.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n3. If the flugel might not be zargled, then according to the first statement, it must be blimmed because if it's not zargled, it has to be blimmed.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
