We also know that the flob might not be movated. This implies that being movated is not a necessary condition for the flob.\n3. However, this information does not tell us anything about whether the flob is skizzled or not. It only tells us that the flob might not need to be movated.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
