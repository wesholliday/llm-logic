We have the statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The smip might not be lupped.\" This implies that there's a possibility that the smip is not lupped. \n\n3. If there's a possibility that the smip is not lupped, then the condition \"it must be lupped\" cannot be true. \n\n4. Therefore, if \"it must be lupped\" is not true, then by the law of excluded middle (one part of a disjunction must be true), \"the smip is shripped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
