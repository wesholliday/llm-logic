The original statement is \"The dreb might not have been vroombed.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities.\n\n2. Now we want to infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed.\" This statement means that it is not necessary for the dreb to have been vroombed; there are other possible scenarios where the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nGiven the original statement, we can indeed infer the second statement because both convey the same idea: there are possibilities where the dreb was not vroombed. The first statement suggests that it's possible the dreb wasn't vroombed, while the second statement explicitly denies the necessity of the dreb being vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
