It does not definitively state that the flug was not blummed, but rather leaves open the possibility of it not being blummed.\n\nNow let's consider the statement we are asked to infer: \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed.\"\n\nThis statement is negating the idea that the flug had to be blummed, meaning there is a possibility that it was not blummed. This aligns with the given sentence, which also suggests the possibility of the flug not being blummed.\n\nSo, after thinking through this step by step, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
