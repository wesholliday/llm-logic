            "content": " Let's break down the given statement and the one to be inferred:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could have been snurgled.\n\n2. The statement to be inferred is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\" This means that it is possible for the fribble to not have been snurgled, which aligns with our understanding of the original statement.\n\nBy analyzing both statements, we can infer that they convey the same idea: there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. The first statement expresses this by saying \"might not,\" while the second statement says \"not must have.\" Both indicate the possibility of non-snurglement (if that's even a word).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
