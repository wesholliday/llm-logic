When we say \"might not,\" it implies a possibility or uncertainty about something not happening.\n2. In this case, the statement is saying that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed (whatever \"sploffed\" means in this context).\n3. Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed.\" This statement asserts that it is possible for the grommet to not be sploffed and that there is no requirement or necessity for the grommet to be sploffed.\n4. Since both statements express a possibility of the grommet not being sploffed, they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
