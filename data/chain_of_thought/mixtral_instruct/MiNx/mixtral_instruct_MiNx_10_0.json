The word 'might' in the original sentence indicates a possibility, but not a certainty. It implies that there is a chance that the wug was not sproinged.\n2. To infer \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged,\" we need to establish that there is no requirement or necessity for the wug to have been sproinged.\n3. Since the original sentence only discusses a possibility and does not claim that the wug was required to be sproinged, it can be inferred that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
