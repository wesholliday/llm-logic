The given statement \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\" implies that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled. It does not rule out the possibility of the smonk being vreebled but acknowledges that it could also be unvreebled (if those are even valid words).\n2. The inferred statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" is a negation of necessity, meaning that it is not required or mandatory for the smonk to have been vreebled.\n\nSince the given statement acknowledges the possibility of the smonk being unvreebled, this implies that it's not necessary for the smonk to be vreebled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
