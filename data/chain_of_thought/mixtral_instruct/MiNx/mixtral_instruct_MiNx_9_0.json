This statement does not rule out the possibility that the twonk could have been plinked, but it also doesn't guarantee that it happened.\n3. Now let's consider \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked.\" This means there is no necessity for the twonk to have been plinked; it could have or could not have been plinked.\n4. Both statements express the idea that there is no certainty or obligation for the twonk to have been plinked, only a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
