When we say \"might not,\" it implies a possibility or uncertainty about something not happening. In this case, it suggests that there is a chance that the whiffle was not actually shanked.\n2. Now, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\" This statement negates the idea that it is necessary for the whiffle to have been shanked.\n3. Since both statements express uncertainty and possibility (that the whiffle was not shanked), they can be logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"",
