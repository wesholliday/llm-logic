This implies that there is no definitive proof or evidence that she did buy the red shirt.\n2. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. To do this, we need to consider whether there is any information suggesting she didn't buy it.\n3. If we don't have any information pointing towards Lisa not buying the red shirt, then we cannot definitively say that she might not have bought it. We can only say that we don't know whether she bought it or not.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt based on the given information alone.",
