This implies that there is no certainty or obligation for Sue to choose pizza.\n2. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza. Since there is no requirement for Sue to pick pizza and she could potentially choose something else, it is reasonable to think that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n3. However, it's essential to note that the given information doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of Sue choosing pizza. It only tells us that Sue wasn't obligated to make that choice.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza, but we cannot definitively say that she didn't choose it based on the given information.",
