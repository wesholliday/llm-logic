This implies that there is no certainty or guarantee that Alex completed the race.\n2. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race. To make this inference, we need evidence suggesting that Alex did not finish the race. However, the given information only tells us that it's not certain that Alex finished the race, but it doesn't provide any direct evidence of Alex not finishing.\n3. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively infer that Alex might not have finished the race. It is possible, but we don't have enough evidence to make this claim with confidence.\n\nAnswer: No.",
