If something is not necessarily true, it means there are possible scenarios where it could be false.\n3. In this case, since we know that the griffin must not have been in the forest, it implies that there is at least one scenario where the griffin is not present in the forest.\n4. Therefore, based on this information, we can indeed infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
