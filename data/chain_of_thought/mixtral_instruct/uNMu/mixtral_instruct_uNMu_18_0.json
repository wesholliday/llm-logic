The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" means that there is no requirement or obligation for the notebook to be in the drawer.\n2. This does not explicitly state whether the notebook is currently in the drawer or not.\n3. However, since there is no necessity for the notebook to be in the drawer, it implies that other locations are possible for the notebook as well.\n4. Based on this reasoning, we can indeed infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
