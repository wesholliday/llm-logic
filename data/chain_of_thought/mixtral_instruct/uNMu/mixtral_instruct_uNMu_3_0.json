This statement implies that there is a possibility that the book was not written by James.\n3. However, it does not definitively rule out James as the author since \"must\" is a strong word indicating certainty, while \"might not\" suggests a possibility but not a certainty.\n4. Nonetheless, since we are considering the possibility of the book not being written by James, we can infer that the book might not have been written by him.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
