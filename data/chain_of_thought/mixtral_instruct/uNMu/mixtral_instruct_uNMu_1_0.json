This means that there is no obligation or requirement for Mary to be present at the wedding.\n2. From this statement alone, we cannot definitively say whether Mary was at the wedding or not. However, we can infer that her presence was not necessary or mandatory.\n3. Since we cannot rule out the possibility that Mary could have been at the wedding voluntarily or for other reasons, we cannot make a firm conclusion about her attendance based solely on this information.\n4. Therefore, while it is possible that Mary might not have been at the wedding, we cannot say for certain without more information.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding, but we cannot definitively conclude her absence based on the given information alone.",
