The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" means that there is no obligation or requirement for the jacket to be on the chair.\n2. This does not explicitly state whether the jacket is currently on the chair or not.\n3. However, it does open up the possibility that the jacket could be elsewhere since there is no necessity for it to be draped over the chair.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
