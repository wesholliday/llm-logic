The statement says \"it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\" This means that it is possible for the sunglasses to be outside of her bag.\n2. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses are definitely not in her bag. It only tells us that they don't have to be there.\n3. Based on this information alone, we cannot definitively say whether the sunglasses might or might not be in her bag. We would need more context or information to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag based solely on the given statement.",
