We have the statement \"Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\" This negates the second part of the first statement.\n3. Since the second part of the first statement has been negated, and a logical disjunction requires at least one true statement, it follows that the remaining part of the first statement, \"the sneg is crampled,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
