We have the statement \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\" This negates the second part of the first statement.\n3. Since the second part of the first statement has been negated, and a logical disjunction requires at least one true statement, it follows that the remaining part of the first statement, \"the flug is blummed,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
