We have the statement \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This means that at least one of these two conditions holds true for the fribble.\n2. The second statement given is \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This negates the second part of the first statement, meaning that the fribble does not have to be crinked.\n3. Since the fribble doesn't have to be crinkled, it doesn't necessarily mean that it can't be crinked - just that it isn't required to be in that state. However, since our first statement only provides two options for the fribble (being snurgled or needing to be crinked), and we now know that the fribble doesn't need to be crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
