We have the statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\" This negates the second part of the first statement.\n3. Since the second part of the first statement is false, then the first part of the first statement must be true for the whole disjunction to hold.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
