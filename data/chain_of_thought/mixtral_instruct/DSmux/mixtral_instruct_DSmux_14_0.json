We have the statement \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\" This negates the second part of our initial disjunction.\n3. Since the second part of the disjunction has been negated, and a disjunction requires at least one true statement, it follows that the first part of the disjunction, \"the clug is fleeked,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
