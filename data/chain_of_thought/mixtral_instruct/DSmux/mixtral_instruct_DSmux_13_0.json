We have the statement \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This negates the necessity of tragging the glip.\n3. Since the second statement denies the necessity of tragging the glip, it means that it is possible for the glip to not be tragged.\n4. Given the first statement, if it's not necessary to trag the glip, then the only remaining option to satisfy the first statement is that the glip is slogged.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
