We have two statements: (A) \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" and (B) \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\".\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as '(A1) The flugel is blimmed or (A2) It must be zargled'.\n3. Statement B tells us that it is not necessary for the flugel to be zargled, which means that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n4. Since statement A has only two possibilities and statement B eliminates one of them (A2), then the remaining possibility must be true: 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
