We have the statement \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This negates the second part of the first statement.\n3. Since the second part of the first statement has been negated, and a logical disjunction requires only one true statement, it follows that the remaining part of the disjunction must be true.\n4. Therefore, since \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" is true, it means that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
