We have two premises:\n   a) Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged (Premise 1).\n   b) It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 presents us with a disjunction, which means that one of its parts must be true. In this case, we have 'the smonk is vreebled' or 'it must be plagged'.\n\n3. Premise 2 negates the second part of the disjunction from Premise 1, meaning it cannot be the case that 'the smonk must be plagged'.\n\n4. Since Premise 2 denies the second part of the disjunction in Premise 1, by process of elimination, the first part of the disjunction (i.e., 'the smonk is vreebled') must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
