            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and reasoning step by step:\n1. We have two statements: (A) \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" and (B) \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as \"(The splat is morphed) OR (it must be quanked).\"\n3. Statement B tells us that \"NOT (it must be quanked)\" is true.\n4. If \"NOT (it must be quanked)\" is true, then it means that \"it cannot be both quanked and not quanked at the same time.\"\n5. Since we know from statement A that \"(The splat is morphed) OR (it must be quanked),\" and now we also know from statement B that \"NOT (it must be quanked)\" is true, this leaves us with only one option: \"(The splat is morphed).\"\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer 'The splat is morphed.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
