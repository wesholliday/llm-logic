We have two statements: (A) \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" and (B) \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as '(A1) The shank is plooked or (A2) The shank must be nugged.'\n3. Statement B tells us that it's false that the shank must be nugged, which means statement A2 is false.\n4. Since statement A2 is false, the only remaining option in statement A is A1: 'The shank is plooked.'\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and reasoning step by step, we can infer that 'The shank is plooked.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
