Specifically, we would need to know if these two operations are mutually exclusive or not.\n\n1. If 'blimming' and 'zargling' are mutually inclusive (i.e., when one happens, the other also happens), then the inference is valid. This is because whenever a flugel is zargled, it must have been blimmed first.\n2. However, if 'blimming' and 'zargling' are not mutually inclusive (i.e., one can happen without the other), then we cannot make this inference. For example, there could be cases where a flugel is zargled but not blimmed.\n\nWithout further information about the relationship between 'blimming' and 'zargling', we cannot definitively say whether or not the given statement implies the desired inference.\n\nAnswer: no.",
