This new statement can be represented as:\n\nNew statement: If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked.\nNotation: N -> P\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement based on the given statement, let's consider a truth table for both statements:\n\n| P (Plooked) | N (Nugged) | P -> N | N -> P |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | T |\n| T | F | F | T |\n| F | T | T | F |\n| F | F | T | T |\n\nAs you can see from the truth table, there is no guarantee that N -> P will always be true if P -> N is true. In fact, as shown in the second row of the table, it's possible for P -> N to be true while N -> P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
