            "content": " To determine if we can logically deduce that \"the doll was plastic,\" let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is called a hypothetical proposition or an implication, often denoted as P \u2192 Q, where P represents 'the doll is plastic' and Q represents 'the truck is metal.'\n2. Next, we are given that 'the truck is metal,' which corresponds to statement Q being true.\n3. Now, the question asks whether we can logically deduce that 'the doll is plastic' based on these two statements. In other words, can we conclude that statement P is true?\n4. To answer this question, let's consider what we know about conditional statements: If a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true and its consequent (Q) is also true, then the antecedent (P) must be true as well. This is known as Modus Ponens in logic.\n5. In our case, since the conditional statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true and its consequent 'the truck is metal' is also true, we can indeed logically deduce that 'the doll was plastic.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
