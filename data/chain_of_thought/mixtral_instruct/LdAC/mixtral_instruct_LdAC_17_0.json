We have the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical proposition in logic. It can be symbolized as P -> Q, where P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n2. We also know that \"Kate ate salad,\" which is represented as Q.\n3. To determine if we can logically deduce that Ben ate pasta (P), we need to examine the given conditional statement. \n4. In this case, there's no information provided about whether or not Kate would have eaten salad regardless of whether Ben ate pasta. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
