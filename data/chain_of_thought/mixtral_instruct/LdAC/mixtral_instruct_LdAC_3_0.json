            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an example of a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if p then q\" where 'p' represents \"the book was written by James\" and 'q' represents \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n2. We also know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" (or 'q').\n3. To determine if we can logically deduce that the book was written by James (or 'p'), we need to apply logical reasoning, specifically Modus Ponens, which states:\n   - If p, then q\n   - q\n   - Therefore, p\n4. In this case, our given statements match the structure of Modus Ponens:\n   - If the book was written by James (p), then it is a mystery novel (q)\n   - The book is a mystery novel (q)\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to these statements, we can logically deduce that:\n   - The book was written by James (p)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
