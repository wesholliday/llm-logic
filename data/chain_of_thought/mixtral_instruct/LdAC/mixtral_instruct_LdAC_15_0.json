We have the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is also known as a material implication, where if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must be true as well.\n2. We are given that \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n3. To logically deduce that \"Sam took a plane,\" we need to ensure that the antecedent of our conditional statement is true. However, there is no information provided about whether or not Sam took a plane.\n4. Since we don't have enough information to conclude that Sam took a plane, we cannot logically deduce it from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
