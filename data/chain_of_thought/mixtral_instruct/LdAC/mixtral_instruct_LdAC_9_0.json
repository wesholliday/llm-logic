            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and use logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as p -> q, where p represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is that \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is represented as q.\n3. We want to find out if we can logically deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt (p) based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, let's apply Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic:\n   - If p -> q is true and q is true, then we can infer that p must be true.\n5. In our case, since the first statement is p -> q (if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt) and the second statement tells us that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt (q), we can apply Modus Ponens to deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt (p).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
