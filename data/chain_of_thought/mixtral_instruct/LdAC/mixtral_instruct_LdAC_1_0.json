            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and use logical reasoning:\n\n1. Given statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (We can write this as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\")\n2. Given statement: Sue was at the wedding. (This is a fact.)\n\nNow let's analyze these statements using logic:\n\n- The first statement tells us that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended.\n- The second statement confirms that Sue did indeed attend the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding, let's consider a truth table for the given statements:\n\n| Mary | Sue  | Mary \u2192 Sue |\n|---|---|---|\n| T   | T    | T         |\n| F   | T    | T         |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, even when Mary is not at the wedding (Mary = False), Sue still attends (Sue = True). This means that based on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
