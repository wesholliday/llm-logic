(We can write this as P -> Q, where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".)\n2. Given statement: Lucy went to the zoo. (This is represented as Q.)\n3. We want to find out if we can logically deduce that Joe went to the park (P).\n4. To do this, we will use Modus Ponens, a valid form of logical reasoning that states: If P -> Q is true and P is true, then Q must be true.\n5. In our case, P -> Q is given as true, and Q has been provided as true.\n6. Therefore, using Modus Ponens, we can deduce that P (Joe went to the park) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
