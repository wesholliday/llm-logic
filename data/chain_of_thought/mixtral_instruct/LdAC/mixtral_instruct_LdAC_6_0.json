The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. This means that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n2. The second statement is 'Bob chose pasta'. According to our reasoning in step 1, this consequence can only be true if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is also true.\n3. Therefore, based on the given statements and applying logical deduction, we can indeed conclude that 'Sue chose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
