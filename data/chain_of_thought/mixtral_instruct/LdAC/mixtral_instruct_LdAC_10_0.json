We have the statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - Symbolically, we can represent this as P -> Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n2. We also know that \"The cat was outside\" (Q).\n3. To determine if we can logically deduce \"The dog was inside\" (P), we need to see if the given information allows us to conclude P with certainty.\n4. However, just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true as well. The original statement only tells us that P implies Q, not that Q implies P.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce \"The dog was inside.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
