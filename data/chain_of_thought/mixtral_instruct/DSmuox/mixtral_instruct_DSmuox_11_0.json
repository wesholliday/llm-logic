We know that \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" which means that it is possible for the flug to not be zimmed.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true.\n3. If the flug can be not zimmed (as per point 1), then the second part of the disjunction \"it must be zimmed\" cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, if the second part of the disjunction is false, the first part \"the flug is blummed\" must be true for the whole statement to hold true.\n5. So yes, we can infer 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
