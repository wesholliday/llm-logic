We know that \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" means that it is possible for the flugel to not be zargled.\n2. Then we are given \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\". This can be broken down into two possibilities: a) The flugel is blimmed, or b) The flugel must be zargled.\n3. Since we know from point 1 that it's possible for the flugel to not be zargled, option b cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is option a: \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
