We have the statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that it is possible for the fleeg to not be surned, or in other words, the negation of \"the fleeg must be surned\" is true.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This can be broken down into two cases: (a) the fleeg is bluttered, or (b) the fleeg must be surned.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the negation of \"the fleeg must be surned\" is true. Therefore, case (b) cannot be true.\n4. Since case (b) cannot be true, and there are no other options in the second statement, it must mean that case (a) is true.\n5. So, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
