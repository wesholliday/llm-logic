We know that \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\" which means that it is possible for the fribble to exist without being crinked.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\". This can be broken down into two parts: a) The fribble is snurgled, or b) The fribble must be crinked.\n3. From the first statement, we know that it's possible for the fribble to not be crinked.\n4. If the fribble doesn't have to be crinked, then only option (a) from the second statement remains: The fribble is snurgled.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
