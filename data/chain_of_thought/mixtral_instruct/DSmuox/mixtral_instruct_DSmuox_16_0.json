The first part says that the sneg is crampled, and the second part says that the sneg must be sproted (which we know from the previous statement is not necessarily true).\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer:\n\nSince it's possible for the sneg to be un-sproted, the second part of the second statement cannot be used as a valid assumption. Therefore, we are left with only one option from the disjunction in the second statement - \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
