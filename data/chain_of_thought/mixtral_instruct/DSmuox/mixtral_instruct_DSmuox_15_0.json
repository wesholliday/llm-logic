We have the statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" which means that there is no obligation or requirement for the dreb to be spened.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\". This can be broken down into two possibilities:\n   a) The dreb is vroombed\n   b) The dreb must be spened\n\n3. Given that we know from the first statement that there is no obligation for the dreb to be spened, we can rule out possibility (b).\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is (a): The dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
