We know that \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" which means that it is possible for the shank to not be nugged.\n2. We also know that \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true.\n3. If the shank does not need to be nugged (as per point 1), then the second part of the disjunction, \"it must be nugged\", cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, if the second part of the disjunction is not true, the first part, \"the shank is plooked\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
