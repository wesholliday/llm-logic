We have the statement \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\" This tells us that there is no requirement for the flob to be movated (moved or activated).\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\" This can be broken down into two possibilities:\n   a) The flob is skizzled\n   b) The flob must be movated\n3. Given that we know from the first statement that there is no requirement for the flob to be movated, option (b) is false in this context.\n4. Therefore, since only one of the two possibilities in the second statement can be true, and option (b) is false, it must mean that option (a) is true: \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
