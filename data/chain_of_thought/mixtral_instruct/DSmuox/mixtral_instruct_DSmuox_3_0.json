We have the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This means that it is possible for the splat to exist without being quanked.\n2. Then we have the statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of its parts must be true.\n3. Given the first statement, we know that the splat can exist without being quanked. Therefore, the second part of the disjunction, \"it must be quanked,\" cannot be true.\n4. Since at least one part of a disjunction must be true and the second part is not, it follows that the first part, \"the splat is morphed,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
