We have the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This means that it is not necessary for the twonk to be plinked; there could be other ways to handle the twonk.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\" This can be broken down into two possibilities: (a) the twonk is varnished, or (b) the twonk must be plinked.\n3. From the first statement, we know that option (b) is not necessarily true because there are other ways to handle the twonk.\n4. Therefore, if option (b) is not true, then by process of elimination, option (a) must be true: the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
