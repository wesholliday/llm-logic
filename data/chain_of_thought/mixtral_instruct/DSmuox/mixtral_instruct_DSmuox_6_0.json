We know that \"it's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" which means that it is possible for the grommet to not be plopped or that there is no necessity for the grommet to be plopped.\n2. Then we are told that \"either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\". This creates two possibilities: either the grommet is sploffed, or it must be plopped.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that there is no necessity for the grommet to be plopped, this means that the second possibility (the grommet must be plopped) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"the grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
