We know that \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" means that there is no requirement for the sprocket to be daggled; it could either be cranked or not daggled at all.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled,\" presents two possibilities: a) the sprocket is cranked, or b) the sprocket must be daggled.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that there's no requirement for the sprocket to be daggled, possibility (b) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is (a): the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
