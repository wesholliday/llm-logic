            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the meaning of each statement:\n\n1. \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This statement does not rule out other options Sue could have chosen; it only highlights the uncertainty around her choice being pizza.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that it is possible for Sue to have chosen something other than pizza.\n\nSince both statements express the possibility of Sue choosing something other than pizza, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' from 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
