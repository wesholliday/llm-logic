The book might not have been written by James: This implies that there is a possibility or doubt that James did not write the book. It does not rule out the involvement of other authors.\n\nNow, let's examine the inferred statement:\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must have been written by James: This statement expresses that it is not necessary for James to be the author; there are no strict requirements for him to have written the book.\n\nSince both statements convey a similar idea, we can infer one from the other. The given statement implies that James may not be the author, and the inferred statement emphasizes this by stating that it is not necessary for James to be the author. Therefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
