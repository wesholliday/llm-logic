The key word here is \"might,\" which indicates uncertainty or possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the inferred statement: It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\n\nThis statement expresses that it is not necessary for Jeff to have played basketball; there is a possibility that he did not play.\n\nSince both statements convey the same idea\u2014that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball\u2014we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
