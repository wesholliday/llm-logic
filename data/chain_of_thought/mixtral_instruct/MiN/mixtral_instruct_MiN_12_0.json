It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nThe first statement (1) implies there is a possibility that the jacket is not on the chair, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the jacket could still be draped over the chair. \n\nThe second statement (2), however, conveys a stronger meaning - it asserts that it is impossible for the jacket to be required to be on the chair. In other words, there is no obligation or necessity for the jacket to be on the chair.\n\nGiven these meanings, we cannot infer (2) from (1). The first statement only introduces a possibility, while the second one negates a requirement. \n\nAnswer: No.",
