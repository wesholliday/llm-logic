It does not definitively state whether or not the watch is actually charging on the dresser, only that it could be possible for it to not be charging there.\n\nNow let's consider the target inference:\n\nInference: It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to analyze whether the given statement contradicts or supports the idea that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nThe given statement suggests a possibility of the watch not charging on the dresser, which does not necessarily mean it contradicts the idea that the watch must be charging there. It simply introduces an alternative possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that 'it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
