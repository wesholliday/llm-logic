            "content": " To approach this question, let's first examine the meaning of both statements:\n\n1. 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt': This statement implies there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It does not definitively state whether she bought it or not but leaves room for uncertainty.\n2. 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt': This statement negates the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt, meaning it was possible for her not to buy it.\n\nNow let's analyze if we can infer the second statement from the first one:\n\nThe first statement ('Lisa might not have bought...') already conveys that there is a possibility of Lisa not having bought the red shirt. This implies that it is not necessary for her to have bought it, which aligns with the meaning of the second statement ('It's not the case that Lisa must have bought...').\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first one since they both convey similar ideas about the likelihood of Lisa having bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
