            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statement and examine its logical structure:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents \"the book was written by James\" and Q represents \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\".\n3. To do this, let's analyze each possibility:\n   - If the book is a mystery novel (Q), it could have been written by James or someone else. So, knowing that the book is a mystery novel doesn't guarantee that James wrote it.\n   - If the book is not a mystery novel (not Q), then it wasn't written by James (not P). This is because if the book isn't a mystery novel, it contradicts the original statement \"If P, then Q\", which means that the assumption \"the book was written by James\" must be false.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can indeed infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
