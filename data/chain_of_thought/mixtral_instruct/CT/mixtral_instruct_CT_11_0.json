            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given conditional statement and examine its logical structure:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents 'the cake was chocolate', and Q represents 'the muffins were blueberry'.\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\". In our case, this translates to 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'.\n3. To find the contrapositive, we negate both parts of the original statement and reverse their order:\n   - Not P is 'the cake was not chocolate'\n   - Not Q is 'the muffins were not blueberry'\n4. Thus, the contrapositive is indeed 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'.\n5. In logic, if a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true (and vice versa). Therefore, since we are given the original statement as true, we can infer that its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
