            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is known as a conditional statement and can be written in logical notation as: S -> T\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true, which would be \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane,\" or in logical notation: ~T -> ~S\n3. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always true if the original statement is true (and vice versa). \n4. To form the contrapositive, we negate both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and then reverse their order. So for our original statement S -> T, the contrapositive ~T -> ~S is indeed the correct negation and reversal.\n5. Therefore, since the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
