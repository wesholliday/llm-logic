            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\". \n2. Specifically, it says: \"If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\"\n3. We want to know if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be: \"If Amy did not play tennis (not Q), then Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\"\n4. To determine if the original statement implies its contrapositive, consider what it means for a conditional statement to be true. A true conditional statement means that whenever the condition (P) is true, the consequence (Q) must also be true.\n5. In this case, the original statement says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. So, if we assume that the original statement is true, then there should never be a situation where Jeff plays basketball and Amy does not play tennis.\n6. Now let's consider the contrapositive: If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. This means that whenever Amy didn't play tennis, Jeff also didn't play basketball.\n7. Given our understanding of the original statement, this contrapositive must also be true. Because if there were ever a situation where Amy didn't play tennis but Jeff still played basketball, then the original statement would be false (since its condition and consequence wouldn't match).\n8. Therefore, since the contrapositive is true whenever the original statement is true, we can indeed infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
