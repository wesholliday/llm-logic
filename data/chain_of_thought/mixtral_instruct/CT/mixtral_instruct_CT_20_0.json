It does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition (A) is not met.\n2. We want to determine if we can infer \"if not B then not A\". This is called the contrapositive of the original statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n3. However, without additional information, we cannot be certain that the original statement implies its contrapositive. The original statement only tells us about the relationship between a red apple and a yellow banana; it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the conditions are not met.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer \"if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
