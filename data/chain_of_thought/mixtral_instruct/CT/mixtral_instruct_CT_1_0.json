            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, which can be written in formal logic as \"Mary being at the wedding (M) \u21d2 Sue being at the wedding (S)\".\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and then swapping their order, resulting in \"Sue not being at the wedding (\u00acS) \u21d2 Mary not being at the wedding (\u00acM)\".\n3. To establish whether the contrapositive is true, let's consider two scenarios:\n   a. Suppose Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acS). In this case, we cannot definitively say that Mary was also not there because the original statement only implies that if Mary was there, then Sue must have been too. It does not state what happens when Sue is absent.\n   b. Now suppose Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acM). This time, we still cannot conclude that Sue was absent because there could be other reasons for Mary's absence.\n4. Since neither scenario allows us to definitively infer the truth of the contrapositive, it is safer to assume that the contrapositive does not necessarily hold true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
