            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given conditional statement and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\". In our case, P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\". This means that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n3. To check if the given statement implies its contrapositive, let's consider two scenarios:\n   a) Suppose Lisa bought the red shirt (P is true). According to the original statement, this implies that Mark bought the blue shirt (Q is true). Now, if we negate Q, meaning Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then P must also be false, meaning Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n   b) Similarly, suppose Lisa did not buy the red shirt (P is false). In this case, the original statement does not provide any information about whether or not Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer the contrapositive of the given statement because one scenario (when P is false) does not hold true. So, the answer to your question is:\n\nAnswer: No.",
