The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q).\"\n2. To form its contrapositive, we swap P and Q and negate both: \"If the mummy was not awake (not Q), then the vampire was not awake (not P).\"\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, yes, we can infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"",
