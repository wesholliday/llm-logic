            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, where the 'if' part is called the antecedent and the 'then' part is called the consequent.\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the antecedent and consequent and negates both, resulting in \"If not B, then not A\".\n3. In our original statement, let A represent 'the shirt was cotton' and B represent 'the pants were denim'. So, the contrapositive would be \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\".\n4. To determine if this is true, consider a situation where the pants are not denim. In that case, there is no information given about what the shirt might be made of. It could still be cotton, or it could be any other material. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the shirt was not cotton.\n5. Since we cannot confirm the truth of the contrapositive based on the given statement, we should be cautious about making this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
