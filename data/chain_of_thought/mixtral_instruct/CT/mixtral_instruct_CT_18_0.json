            "content": " To approach this question, let's first understand the given statement:\n\nStatement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\". In logic, we can represent it as:\n\np -> q\n\nwhere p = \"the doll was plastic\" and q = \"the truck was metal\"\n\nNow, let's consider the given proposition to be proven:\n\nProposition: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nThis is also a conditional statement in the form of \"if not q, then not p\". Let's represent it as:\n\n~q -> ~p\n\nTo determine if we can infer this proposition from the original statement, let's examine both statements together.\n\nThe given statement (p -> q) tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. If the truck is not metal (~q), it means the truck could be made of some other material, say wood or plastic. However, this does not necessarily imply that the doll cannot be plastic. The original statement only guarantees a relationship between a plastic doll and a metal truck, but it doesn't restrict having a plastic doll with a non-metal truck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
