            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form \"If A, then B\". This is a conditional statement where if condition A is true, then consequence B must be true as well.\n2. However, we want to find out if the contrapositive of this statement is also true. The contrapositive switches the hypothesis and the conclusion, and negates both. So it would be \"If not B, then not A\".\n3. In our case, A represents 'Alex finished the race' and B represents 'Chris finished the race'.\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive would be \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\".\n5. To determine if this is true, consider extreme cases. If Chris didn't even start the race, how could Alex have finished after him?\n6. Thus, based on logic and reasoning, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
