            "content": " To approach this question, let's first break down the given conditional statement:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate the salad (S).\n   P -> S\n\nNow, we want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions.\n\n1. Negate the hypothesis: Ben did not eat pasta (~P)\n2. Negate the conclusion: Kate did not eat the salad (~S)\n3. Swap the positions: If Kate did not eat the salad (~S), then Ben did not eat pasta (~P).\n\nTo confirm if this is a valid inference, we can check whether the contrapositive is true. In general, the contrapositive of a true statement is also true and vice versa. Therefore, let's examine the original statement to see if its contrapositive holds:\n\n1. Original statement: P -> S\n2. Contrapositive: ~S -> ~P\n\nSince both statements are equivalent, we can infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad (~S), then Ben did not eat pasta (~P)' from the original statement 'If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate the salad (S)'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
