            "content": " To approach this question, let's first understand the given conditional statement:\n\nPremise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nThis is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, where the truth of one event (the hypothesis) implies the truth of another event (the conclusion). In this case, if the car being red is true, then the truck being blue must also be true.\n\nNow let's examine the statement we want to infer:\n\nHypothesis: The truck was not blue.\nConclusion: The car was not red.\n\nTo determine whether this inferred conditional statement is valid, we can use a method called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of an original conditional statement swaps the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nOriginal Statement: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nContrapositive: If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nSince our inferred statement matches the contrapositive of the original statement, and the original statement is true, we can indeed infer that 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
