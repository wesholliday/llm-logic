            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a form of implication known as a conditional statement, where the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is called the antecedent and the second part (Bob choosing pasta) is called the consequent.\n2. We want to determine if we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from this original statement. This new statement also has an antecedent (\"Bob did not choose pasta\") and a consequent (\"Sue did not choose pizza\").\n3. To establish whether the inference is valid, we can use a technique called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement swaps the positions of the antecedent and consequent and negates both parts. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n4. The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n5. Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
