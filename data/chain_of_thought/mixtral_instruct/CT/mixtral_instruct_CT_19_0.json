            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is known as a conditional statement and can be written in logical notation as: T -> J\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. So, the contrapositive of our original statement would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" In logical notation, this is: ~J -> ~T\n3. To determine if the contrapositive is true, we need to consider whether its truth follows from the truth of the original statement. \n4. The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, then so is the other. This is a fundamental principle in logic called the law of contraposition.\n5. Therefore, since the original statement is true, it follows that its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
