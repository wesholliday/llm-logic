            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement, often called \"if-then\" statements. In logic, this is represented as P -> Q, where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n2. What we want to find out is if we can infer the reverse conditional statement, which would be Q -> P, or 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding'.\n3. However, just because one conditional statement is true, it doesn't mean that the reverse is also true. This is a common misconception in logic.\n4. For example, consider this true statement: \"If it rains, then the ground gets wet.\" The reverse is not necessarily true: \"If the ground is wet, then it must have rained.\" There could be other reasons for the ground being wet.\n5. Similarly, in our original statement, even if 'Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence, it doesn't mean that Sue's presence implies Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: No.",
