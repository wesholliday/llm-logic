This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if A, then B\".\n2. To determine if we can infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\", we need to consider whether the original statement implies this inverse relationship.\n3. However, just because Sue choosing pizza leads to Bob choosing pasta does not necessarily mean that Bob's choice of pasta will always result in Sue choosing pizza. There could be other reasons for Bob to choose pasta.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
