We know that \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if someone named James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n2. However, just because a book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that James wrote it. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
