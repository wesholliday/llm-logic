This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\".\n3. The converse of this statement would be \"if q, then p\", which in our case is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n4. However, just because the original statement is true does not necessarily mean that its converse is also true.\n5. Without more information about whether Sam or Erin actually took any transportation, we cannot definitively say that the converse is true.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"",
