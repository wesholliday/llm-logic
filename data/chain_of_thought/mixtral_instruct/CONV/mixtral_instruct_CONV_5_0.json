We have the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is an example of a conditional statement, often written as P -> Q, where P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n2. The given statement does not necessarily mean that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff also played basketball. It's possible that Amy could have played tennis for some other reason unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n3. To formally determine whether the inferred statement is true or false, we would need more information about the situation. However, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
