This is a conditional statement known as a hypothesis (if-part) and conclusion (then-part).\n2. To determine if the converse of this statement is true, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\".\n3. However, just because the original statement is true does not automatically mean that its converse is also true. We cannot assume that the presence of the wolf in the den implies the presence of the bear in the case without further information.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
