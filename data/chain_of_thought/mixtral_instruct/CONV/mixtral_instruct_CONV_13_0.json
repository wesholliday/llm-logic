            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It states: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. This does not mean that if the truck is blue, the car must be red. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue.\n3. For example, consider the following scenario: The car could have been any color except red (say, it was green), and the truck would still be blue. In this case, the original statement holds true, but the reverse isn't necessarily true.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
