We also know that the truck was metal (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B alone, we cannot definitively say whether or not the doll is plastic because statement A only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, but it doesn't tell us anything about when the truck is metal.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, it does not necessarily follow that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
