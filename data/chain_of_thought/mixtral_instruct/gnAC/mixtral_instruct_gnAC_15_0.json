We are also given that Erin took a train.\n3. From the second statement alone, we cannot definitively say whether Sam took a plane or not because there could be other reasons why Erin might have taken a train (for example, maybe they were going to different destinations).\n4. Therefore, even though 'Erin took a train' is true, it does not necessarily follow that 'Sam took a plane' is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
