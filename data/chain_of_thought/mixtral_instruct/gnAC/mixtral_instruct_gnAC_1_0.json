We also know that Sue was at the wedding (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n4. Since we already know from statement B that Sue was at the wedding, it means that either Mary was at the wedding or Sue was at the wedding regardless of whether Mary was there or not.\n5. However, just because Sue is at the wedding does not guarantee that Mary is also at the wedding. It could be the case that Sue attended without Mary.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not necessarily follow that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.",
