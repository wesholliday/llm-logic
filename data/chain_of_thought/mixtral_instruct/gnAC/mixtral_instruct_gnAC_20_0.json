We also know that the banana was yellow (let's call this statement B).\n3. However, just because statement A is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the apple was red. It could be that the apple was some other color and the banana still happened to be yellow.\n4. In other words, even though we know that if the apple were red, then the banana would be yellow, we cannot definitively say that the apple was red based solely on the fact that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
