We also know that the pants were denim (let's call this statement B).\n3. However, just because B is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that A is true. For example, there could be other reasons why the pants were denim besides the shirt being cotton.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that the pants were denim, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was cotton based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
