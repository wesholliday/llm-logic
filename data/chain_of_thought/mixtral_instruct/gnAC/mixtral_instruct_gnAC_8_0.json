We know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (let's call this statement A).\n2. We also know that the mummy was awake (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only conclude that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. However, it doesn't directly tell us whether the vampire was actually awake or not.\n4. Statement B tells us that the mummy was awake, but it doesn't provide any information about the vampire's state.\n5. Based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake. It is possible that the vampire could have been asleep while the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
