We also know that the unicorn was in the forest (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. However, it does not directly tell us that the griffin is actually in the forest.\n4. Statement B tells us that the unicorn was in the forest, but it doesn't provide any information about whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n5. Based on these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was in the forest. It is possible, but not necessary.\n\nAnswer: No.",
