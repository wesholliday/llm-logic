We are also told that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. However, just because Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex finished the race as well. It could be the case that Chris finished the race without Alex, or they both finished together.\n4. The given statement only assures us that if Alex finished, then Chris did too. But it doesn't guarantee that Alex finishing the race is a certainty.\n\nAnswer: No.",
