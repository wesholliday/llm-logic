We also know that Kate ate salad (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only infer that *if* Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. It doesn't directly tell us whether or not Ben actually ate pasta.\n4. However, since we know from statement B that Kate did indeed eat salad, it is possible that Ben ate pasta. But there could also be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n5. So while it's possible that Ben ate pasta given these statements, it isn't necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
