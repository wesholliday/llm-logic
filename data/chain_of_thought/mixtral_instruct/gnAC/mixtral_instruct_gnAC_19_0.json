We also know that Jen did watch basketball.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Tom watched football. Here's why:\n\n- Just because Jen was watching basketball doesn't mean Tom had to be watching football. There could be other reasons why Jen was watching basketball.\n\nTherefore, even though we know Jen watched basketball, it does not necessarily follow that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: No.",
