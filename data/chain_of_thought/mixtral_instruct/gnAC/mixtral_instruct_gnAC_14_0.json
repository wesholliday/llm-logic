We also know that the wolf was in the den (let's call this statement B).\n3. However, just because statement A is true when B is true, it doesn't mean that B can only be true if A is true. In other words, even though \"if A then B\" is true, \"if B then A\" might not be true.\n4. For example, consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" Just because this statement is true, it doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining (the ground could have been watered by a sprinkler).\n5. Similarly, in our case, even though we know that \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and that \"the wolf was in the den,\" we cannot conclude for certain that \"the bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
