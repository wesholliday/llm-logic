We also know that the car was not red (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only make conclusions about the truck's color when the car is red. However, in our case, the car is not red.\n4. Therefore, even though the truck being blue is part of statement A, since the condition (the car being red) is not met due to statement B, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: No.",
