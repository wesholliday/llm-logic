We are also given that the dog was not inside (let's call this statement B).\n3. Based on statement A, we can infer that since the dog was not inside, the cat could have been either inside or outside. However, statement A does not provide sufficient information about the cat's location when the dog is not inside.\n4. Therefore, using only statements A and B, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
