            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n2. The second statement tells us that \"the vampire was not awake,\" which is equivalent to saying \"not P\" or \"it is false that the vampire was awake.\"\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer 'The mummy was not awake' (or 'not Q') based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if the mummy were awake (Q). According to the first statement, if the vampire had been awake (P), then the mummy would also be awake (Q). However, since we know that the vampire was not awake (not P), this scenario cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the mummy was not awake (not Q) because if the mummy were awake (Q), it would contradict the given information about the vampire's state.\n6. So yes, we can infer 'The mummy was not awake' based on the two initial statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
