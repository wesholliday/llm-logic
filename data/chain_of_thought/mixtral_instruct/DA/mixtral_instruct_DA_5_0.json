            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that the statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The first part of this statement is called the hypothesis (or antecedent), which in this case is 'Jeff played basketball'.\n3. The second part of the statement is called the conclusion (or consequent), which is 'Amy played tennis'.\n4. We are also given that 'Jeff did not play basketball', which contradicts the hypothesis of our conditional statement.\n5. When the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the truth value of the conclusion based solely on this information. This concept is known as \"vacuous truth\" in logic.\n6. Therefore, since the hypothesis is false ('Jeff did not play basketball'), we cannot determine whether 'Amy played tennis' or 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'Amy did not play tennis' based on the given information.",
