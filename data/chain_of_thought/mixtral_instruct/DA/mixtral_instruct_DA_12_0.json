We have the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is also known as a material implication or a hypothetical proposition.\n2. We are also given that \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n3. In logic, when we negate a conditional statement, it means either the antecedent (the 'if' part) is false or the consequent (the 'then' part) is true.\n4. Here, since Joe didn't go to the park (antecedent), we cannot make any conclusions about Lucy going to the zoo based solely on this information.\n5. However, if the original conditional statement were an equivalence (biconditional), then we could infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo because Joe didn't go to the park. But in this case, it is only a one-way implication.\n\nAnswer: No.",
