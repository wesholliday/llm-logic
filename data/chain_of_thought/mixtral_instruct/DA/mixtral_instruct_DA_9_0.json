            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical or an 'if-then' statement.\n2. The second statement is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" we need to consider whether the given statements allow for this conclusion.\n4. In the first statement, the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt is Lisa buying the red shirt. However, in the second statement, we learn that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n5. Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt has not been met.\n6. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
