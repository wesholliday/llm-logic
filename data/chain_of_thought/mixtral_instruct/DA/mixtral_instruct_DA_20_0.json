We also know that the apple was not red (let's call this statement B).\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the banana was not yellow because the given conditional statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red, not when it isn't.\n4. In other words, there could be other possibilities where the apple is not red and the banana can still be yellow or not yellow.\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
