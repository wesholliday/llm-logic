            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second statement given is \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that \"The truck was not metal,\" we need to examine the relationship between the two original statements.\n4. In logic, when we negate a conditional statement (i.e., change it from true to false), we actually create a new true statement by combining the original 'if' part with the negation of the 'then' part or vice versa.\n5. So, if \"The doll was not plastic,\" then the opposite of \"the truck was metal\" must be true: \"The truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
