            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement: \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which is represented as ~P.\n3. Now we want to determine if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding (~Q) based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if Sue were actually at the wedding (Q). According to the first statement (P -> Q), if Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would also be there. However, we know from the second statement that Mary was not at the wedding (~P).\n5. Since Mary wasn't at the wedding, it contradicts the assumption that Sue was there (Q) because, according to the first statement, if Mary had been present, Sue would have been too.\n6. Therefore, since assuming that Sue was at the wedding leads to a contradiction, we must conclude that Sue was not at the wedding (~Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
