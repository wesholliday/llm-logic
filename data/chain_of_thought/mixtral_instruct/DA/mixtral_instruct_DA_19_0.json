            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n2. However, we are told that \"Tom did not watch football.\" Since the condition in our first statement is false, we cannot determine whether the consequence is true or false based solely on this information.\n3. In logic, when we have an \"if-then\" statement and the condition is false, it does not allow us to make any conclusions about the truth of the consequence. This situation is called \"vacuous truth.\"\n4. Therefore, since we cannot determine whether Jen watched basketball based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'Jen did not watch basketball.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
