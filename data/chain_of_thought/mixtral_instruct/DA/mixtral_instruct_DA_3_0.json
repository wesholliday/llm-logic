            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and examine their logical relationships:\n\n1. Given statement: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This can be represented as: (James wrote the book) -> (The book is a mystery novel).\n2. Given statement: The book was not written by James. This can be represented as: ~(James wrote the book).\n3. We want to infer whether: The book is not a mystery novel, which can be represented as: ~(The book is a mystery novel).\n4. To determine if we can make this inference, let's use logical reasoning:\n   - From the second statement, we know that James did not write the book.\n   - In the first statement, if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel. However, since James did not write the book, we cannot directly conclude whether the book is a mystery novel or not.\n   - To establish that the book is not a mystery novel, we need an additional premise linking James's authorship to the genre of the book. Without this information, we cannot definitively make the inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
