We have the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n2. The second statement we are given is \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that \"Kate did not eat the salad,\" we need to consider what the first statement tells us when its condition is not met. In other words, what happens when Ben does not eat pasta?\n4. The first statement does not specify any action for Kate when Ben does not eat pasta; it only states that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate eats salad. Since there is no information about what Kate does when Ben doesn't eat pasta, we cannot definitively say that she did not eat the salad.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'Kate did not eat the salad.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
