We know that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"implication\" or \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second piece of information we have is \"the cake was not chocolate.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that \"the muffins were not blueberry,\" we need to examine the relationship between the two statements provided.\n4. Since the cake was not chocolate, the condition in our first statement has not been met. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether or not the muffins are blueberry based solely on this information.\n5. In other words, if the cake is not chocolate, it does not necessarily mean that the muffins must be something other than blueberry. They could still be blueberry, or they could be any other flavor.\n\nAnswer: No.",
