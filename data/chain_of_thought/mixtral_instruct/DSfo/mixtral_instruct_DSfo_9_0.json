We have two statements: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" and \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box\".\n2. The first statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, which means it could be anywhere else but the floor.\n3. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box. However, we already know from the first statement that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor.\n4. Therefore, since the missing puzzle piece is neither on the floor nor blending in on the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
