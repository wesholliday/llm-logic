The first is \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\" The second is \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\"\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze the second statement. It's a disjunction (either/or statement). One part of this disjunction is that the shoes are lined up by the door, which we know from the first statement to be false.\n\nStep 3: Since one part of the disjunction is false, and it's an 'exclusive or' (meaning only one part can be true), then the other part must be true.\n\nStep 4: The other part of the disjunction is that the shoes are in the closet. As we determined in step 3, this must be true because its counterpart is false and they cannot both be false in an exclusive or statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
