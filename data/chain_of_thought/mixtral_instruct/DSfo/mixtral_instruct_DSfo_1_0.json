Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements step by step:\n- The first statement tells us that Fido is not present in the garden.\n- The second statement presents two possibilities: a) Fido is in the garden or b) Fido is inside. However, we know from the first statement that option a) is false because Fido is not in the garden.\n- Since only one of the options in the second statement can be true and option a) has been proven false, it means that option b) must be true by default.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can indeed infer 'Fido is inside'.\nAnswer: yes",
