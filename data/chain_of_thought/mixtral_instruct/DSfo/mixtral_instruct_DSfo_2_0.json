This means that the book is not in its expected location, which is the table.\n\nStep 2: The second statement gives us another possible location for the book - 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf'. Since we have already established that the book is not on the table, we can eliminate the first part of this disjunction.\n\nStep 3: After eliminating the first part of the disjunction, we are left with 'it is on the shelf'. This implies that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nStep 4: Given the information provided, there are no other possible locations for the book mentioned. Therefore, based on the process of elimination and the given statements, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
