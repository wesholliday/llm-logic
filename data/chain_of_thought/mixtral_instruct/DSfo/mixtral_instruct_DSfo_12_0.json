The first statement is \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\" The second statement is \"Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\"\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze both statements. In the first statement, we are told that the jacket is not in the closet. This means that there are only two possibilities left for where the jacket could be - either it is still somewhere else in the room or it has been taken out of the room entirely.\n\nStep 3: Now let's look at the second statement. It presents us with a choice between two options: either the jacket is hanging in the closet, or it is draped over the chair. However, according to the first statement, we already know that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, since the jacket cannot be in the closet and must be somewhere else, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
