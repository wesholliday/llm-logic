The first one is \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\" This tells us that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\nStep 2: The second statement is \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This is a disjunctive (either-or) statement, which means one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 3: Given that we know from the first statement that the milk is not in the fridge, and considering the second statement's two options, it follows that the second part of the disjunctive statement must be true: \"it is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
