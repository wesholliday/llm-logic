We have two statements: \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" and \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\".\n2. The first statement tells us that the missing sock is not located under the bed.\n3. The second statement presents us with a logical disjunction (OR), which means one of the two possibilities must be true: either the missing sock is under the bed, or it's in the laundry basket.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the missing sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility according to the second statement is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
