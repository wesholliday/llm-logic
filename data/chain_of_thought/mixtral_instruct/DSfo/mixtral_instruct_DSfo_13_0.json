It has two parts connected by 'or'. These are mutually exclusive possibilities, meaning only one of them can be true at a time.\n\nStep 3: Since statement S1 tells us that the toy is not on the shelf, this means the first part of statement S2 (the toy is sitting on the shelf) is false.\n\nStep 4: If the first part of statement S2 is false, then by logical reasoning, the second part must be true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the toy being in the toy box (the second part of statement S2) is a valid conclusion based on statements S1 and S2.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
