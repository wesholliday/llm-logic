We also know that either 'the cat is playing in the bedroom' or 'it's napping on the couch' must be true according to the second statement.\n3. However, since we already know that 'the cat isn't playing in the bedroom', only the second part of the second statement can be true: 'it's napping on the couch'.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer that 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
