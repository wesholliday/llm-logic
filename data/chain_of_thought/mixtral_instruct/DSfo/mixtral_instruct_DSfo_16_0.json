We know that the statement 'The pen isn't on my desk' tells us where the pen is not, but it doesn't provide information about where the pen might be.\n2. The second statement, 'Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag', gives us two possible locations for the pen: on the desk or in the bag.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, then by process of elimination, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
