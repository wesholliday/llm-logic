We are also told that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. However, just because Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex finished the race too. It could be the case that Chris finished the race for some other reason unrelated to Alex's performance.\n4. So, even though we know both of these statements are true:\n   - If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   - Chris finished the race.\n5. We cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race as well.\n\nAnswer: No.",
