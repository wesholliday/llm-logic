            "content": "First, let's analyze the given information:\n1. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true (we'll call this statement A).\n2. 'The truck was metal' is true (let's call this statement B).\n\nNow we want to determine if 'The doll was plastic' is true based on statements A and B. To do this, let's use a method called logical reasoning or truth tables.\n\nStatement A can be broken down into two parts: 'the doll was plastic' (P) and 'the truck was metal' (M). So, A becomes P -> M.\n\nWe are given that statement A is true and statement B is true. To check if P is also true, we need to look at the possible combinations of P and M that make A true:\n\n1. P is true, and M is true.\n2. P is false, and M can be either true or false (since it doesn't affect the truth value of A).\n\nSince we know B (the truck was metal) is true, only option 1 from above applies here. Therefore, 'The doll was plastic' (P) must be true as well for both statements A and B to hold true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
