This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We also know that 'The truck was blue' is true.\n3. However, just because the truck is blue does not necessarily mean that the car being red caused the truck to be blue. There could be other reasons for the truck being blue.\n4. Therefore, even though we know both statements are true individually, it does not logically follow that 'The car was red' is true based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
