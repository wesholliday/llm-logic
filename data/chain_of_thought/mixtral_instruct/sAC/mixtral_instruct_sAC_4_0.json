This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We also know that 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The alien visited Mars' is true, we need to apply Modus Ponens, which is a rule of inference in classical logic. It states that if P \u2192 Q and P are both true, then Q must be true.\n4. In our case, P represents 'The alien visited Mars', and Q represents 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n5. Since we know that 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is true (P \u2192 Q) and 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true (Q), it follows that 'The alien visited Mars' must be true (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
