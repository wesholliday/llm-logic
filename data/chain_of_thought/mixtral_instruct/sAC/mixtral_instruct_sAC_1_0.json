            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the information given:\n1. We know that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true. This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothesis or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We also know that 'Sue was at the wedding' is true.\n\nNow let's think about whether 'Mary was at the wedding' must be true based on this information:\n- Since we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding, it seems plausible that Mary could have been at the wedding as well.\n- However, just because the condition (Mary being at the wedding) would result in the statement's conclusion (Sue being at the wedding), it doesn't necessarily mean that the condition is true.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.",
