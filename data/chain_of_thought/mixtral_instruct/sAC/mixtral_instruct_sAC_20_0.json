            "content": "Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. We know that 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is true. This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We also know that 'The banana was yellow' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The apple was red' is true, we need to consider whether the condition (the 'if' part) of our first statement is met. In other words, is it true that the apple was red?\n4. However, just because the banana was yellow, it doesn't necessarily mean that the apple was red. The color of the banana does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n5. Therefore, even though we know 'The banana was yellow' is true, we cannot conclude that 'The apple was red' is true based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
