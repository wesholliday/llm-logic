            "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is true. This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We also know that 'The pants were denim' is true.\n3. To determine if 'The shirt was cotton' is true, we need to apply Modus Ponens, which states: If P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must be true.\n4. In our case, P represents 'The shirt was cotton' and Q represents 'The pants were denim'.\n5. Since the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true and Q (the pants being denim) is also true, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that P must be true.\n6. Therefore, 'The shirt was cotton' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
