This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We are also given that 'Amy played tennis' is true.\n3. To determine if 'Jeff played basketball' is true, we need to consider the possibility of Jeff playing basketball causing Amy to play tennis. However, this causality is not explicitly stated or implied in the given information.\n4. Based on the given information alone, it does not necessarily follow that 'Jeff played basketball' is true. It could be true or false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
