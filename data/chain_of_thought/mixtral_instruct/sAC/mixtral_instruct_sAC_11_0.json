We also know that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can only conclude that *if* the cake was chocolate, then the muffins being blueberry follows. However, it does not necessarily mean that the cake being chocolate caused the muffins to be blueberry.\n4. The truth of statement B does not automatically imply the truth of statement A's hypothesis (that the cake is chocolate). It could be that the muffins were blueberry for some other reason.\n5. Therefore, even though both statements A and B are true, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
