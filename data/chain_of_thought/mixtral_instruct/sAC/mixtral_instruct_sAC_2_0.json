We also know that 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement A, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then statement B would be true.\n4. However, just because statement B is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the griffin had to be in the forest. It could be the case that the unicorn was in the forest for some other reason.\n5. In order to determine whether the griffin was in the forest based on statements A and B, we would need additional information linking the presence of the griffin to the presence of the unicorn.\n\nAnswer: No.",
