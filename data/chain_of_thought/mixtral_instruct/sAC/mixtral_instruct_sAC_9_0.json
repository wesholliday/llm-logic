We also know that Mark bought the blue shirt (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statement B alone, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt because there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n4. However, since A states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, and we know from statement B that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa must have bought the red shirt (because according to A, whenever Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark buys the blue shirt).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
