            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and use logical reasoning:\n1. We know that 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is true (let's call this statement A). This is a conditional statement, which can also be represented as \"Vampire being awake \u2192 Mummy being awake.\"\n2. We are also told that 'The mummy was awake' is true (let's call this statement B).\n3. To determine if 'The vampire was awake' (let's call this statement C) is true, we need to examine the relationship between statements A and B.\n4. Since A is a conditional statement, we can apply Modus Ponens, which states that if both the antecedent (Vampire being awake) and the entire conditional statement (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake) are true, then the consequent (Mummy being awake) must also be true.\n5. In this case, we know that B (Mummy being awake) is true, but Modus Ponens doesn't directly help us here because it requires knowing that A (Vampire being awake \u2192 Mummy being awake) and the antecedent are true.\n6. However, since A is given as true, if we assume C (Vampire being awake) is false, then the mummy should be asleep, contradicting statement B.\n7. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, C must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
