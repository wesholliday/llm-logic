            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and use logical reasoning:\n1. We know that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true (let's call this statement A). This means that if event B (the book being written by James) occurs, then event C (the book being a mystery novel) will also occur.\n2. We are given that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true (let's call this statement B).\n3. Now we want to determine whether 'The book was written by James' is true based on statements A and B.\n4. To do this, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (from statement A). Since we know that the book is a mystery novel (statement B), this scenario aligns with our given information.\n   b) However, if the book being a mystery novel does not necessarily mean it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n5. Based on this reasoning, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true based only on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
