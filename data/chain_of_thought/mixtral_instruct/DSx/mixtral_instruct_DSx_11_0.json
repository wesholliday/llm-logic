We have the statement \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. The second statement we are given is \"The flug is not zimmed.\" This negates the second part of our initial disjunction.\n\n3. Since both statements cannot be false in classical logic, and the second part of our initial disjunction has been negated, it follows that the first part must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer 'The flug is blummed'.",
