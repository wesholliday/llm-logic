We have the statement \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. We also know that \"The glip is not tragged.\" \n\nSince we know that the glip is not tragged, and since at least one part of the original disjunction must be true, it follows that the other part, \"the glip is slogged,\" must be true. \n\nAnswer: Yes.",
