(2)\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements step by step:\n- Statement (1) presents two possible options for the dreb: either it is vroombed or spened.\n- Statement (2) rules out one of those options by stating that the dreb is not spened.\n- Since statement (1) only provides two mutually exclusive options, and one has been ruled out in statement (2), we can now infer that the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
