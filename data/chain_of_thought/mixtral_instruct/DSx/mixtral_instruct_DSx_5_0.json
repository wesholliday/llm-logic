We have been told that \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled.\" This statement presents two possible conditions for the zinger - being fraggled or smoogled.\n2. Next, we are informed that \"The zinger is not smoogled.\" This means that one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement has been ruled out.\n3. Since the zinger is not smoogled, and there are no other options given for the zinger's state, it must be true that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
