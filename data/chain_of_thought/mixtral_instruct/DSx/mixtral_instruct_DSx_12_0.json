We have the statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement we are given is \"The smip is not lupped.\" \n3. If the smip is not lupped, then we can infer that it must be shripped, because the first statement tells us that at least one of those two conditions must be true.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
