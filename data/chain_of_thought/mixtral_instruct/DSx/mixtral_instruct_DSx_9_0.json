We have been told that \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\" This statement presents us with two possible conditions for the twonk - being plinked or being varnished.\n2. The second piece of information states, \"The twonk is not plinked.\" This means that one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement does not apply to the twonk.\n3. Since we know that the twonk is not plinked, there is only one possibility left from the initial statement: the twonk being varnished.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
