We have a statement: \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\" This is an example of a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second piece of information we are given is: \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This statement negates the second part of the initial disjunction.\n3. Since the second part of the initial disjunction (\"it is daggled\") has been proven false, by process of elimination, the first part must be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
