We have two statements:\n   a) Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked. (Let's call this Statement A)\n   b) The fribble is not crinked. (Let's call this Statement B)\n\n2. Now, let's analyze Statement A further:\n   a) Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked can be rewritten as Disjunction (OR): P v Q\n       where P represents 'The fribble is snurgled' and Q represents 'It is crinked'\n\n3. With Statement B, we are given that the fribble is not crinkled: \u00acQ\n\n4. Now, using Disjunctive Syllogism, which states that if P v Q is true and \u00acQ is also true, then P must be true; we can infer that:\n   a) Since either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked (P v Q) is true and the fribble is not crinked (\u00acQ), it follows that the fribble is snurgled (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
