We have two statements: (A) \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged\" and (B) \"The shank is not nugged\".\n2. Statement A can be rewritten as '(Plooked \u2228 Nugged)' where Plooked and Nugged represent the two possible states of the shank.\n3. Statement B tells us that '\u00acNugged' (not Nugged) is true, which means the shank cannot be in the Nugged state.\n4. Since the shank can only be in one of the two stated conditions (Plooked or Nugged), and we now know it's not in the Nugged state, it must be in the Plooked state by default.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
