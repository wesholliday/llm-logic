We have two statements about the grommet: (a) \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" and (b) \"The grommet is not plopped\".\n2. In statement (a), we are given a choice between two possibilities for the grommet \u2013 either it is sploffed or plopped.\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the second possibility (the grommet being plopped) does not apply in this case.\n4. Since we know from statement (b) that the grommet is not plopped, and based on the information provided in statement (a), it must mean that the only remaining option for the grommet's state is \"sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
