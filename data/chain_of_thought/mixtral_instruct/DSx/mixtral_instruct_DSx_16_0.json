We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted\"\n   b) \"The sneg is not sproted\"\n2. The first statement can be rephrased as \"At least one of these conditions is true: the sneg is crampled, or the sneg is sproted.\"\n3. The second statement tells us that the second condition (the sneg being sproted) is not true.\n4. Since we know that at least one of the conditions must be true, and the second condition has been proven false, it follows logically that the first condition (the sneg being crampled) must be true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
