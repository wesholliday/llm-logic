We are given the statement \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\" This statement presents two possible outcomes for the whiffle - either it is shanked or tinked.\n2. Next, we are told that \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This means there is only one remaining possibility for the whiffle's state since it cannot be tinked.\n3. Since the statement \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked\" presents two mutually exclusive possibilities, and we now know that the whiffle cannot be tinked, it must be true that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
