            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply principles of logic:\n1. We have two statements: (A) \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" and (B) \"The splat is not quanked\".\n2. Our goal is to determine if we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\" based on these two statements.\n3. Statement A can be rewritten as \"(The splat is morphed) OR (The splat is quanked)\". This means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n4. Statement B tells us that \"The splat is not quanked\", which implies that the second part of statement A, \"The splat is quanked\", is false.\n5. Since only one condition in statement A must be true and we know that the second condition is false, it follows that the first condition, \"The splat is morphed\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
