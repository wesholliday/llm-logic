            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n1. We have two statements about a mysterious object called \"wug.\"\n2. The first statement says, \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\" This means that there are only two possible states for the wug: being sproinged or being garbled.\n3. The second statement tells us, \"The wug is not garbled.\"\n4. Based on this information, we can infer that if the wug is not in one state (garbled), then it must be in the other state (sproinged).\n5. Therefore, since the wug is not garbled, it follows logically that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
