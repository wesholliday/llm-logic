The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\", where P represents 'the zibble is zapped', and Q represents 'the glorp will zoon'.\n2. However, we are now asked to consider an additional condition, R, which states 'the quib is squinked'.\n3. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between P, R, and Q. In other words, it doesn't tell us whether squinking the quib has any effect on the zapping of the zibble or the zoonting of the glorp.\n4. Therefore, based solely on the given statement, we cannot infer that 'If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon'. It could be true, but it could also be false \u2013 there simply isn't enough information to determine one way or the other.\n\nAnswer: No.",
