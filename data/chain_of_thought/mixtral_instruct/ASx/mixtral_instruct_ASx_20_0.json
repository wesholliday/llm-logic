The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents 'the plim is grobbled', and Q represents 'the whiffle will sploosh'.\n2. We are now asked to consider whether the statement \"If P and R, then Q\" can be inferred from the original statement, where R represents 'the drazzle is drooped'.\n3. To infer this new conditional statement, we need additional information that connects the grobbledness of the plim with the droopiness of the drazzle. In other words, we need to know if there is a relationship between P and R.\n4. Since no such relationship has been provided, we cannot infer the new conditional statement \"If P and R, then Q\" based solely on the original statement \"If P, then Q\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
