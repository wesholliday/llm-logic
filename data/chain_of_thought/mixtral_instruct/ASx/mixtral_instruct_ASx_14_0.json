Given statement: \"If the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk.\"\n2. This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q (where P represents 'the frizzle is dinked' and Q represents 'the zarp will splunk')\n3. Now, we are asked if we can infer the following statement: \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\"\n4. This new statement can be represented as: (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q (where R represents 'the sklonk is grooped')\n5. To determine if we can infer this new statement from the given one, we need to examine the relationship between P and Q in the original statement.\n6. The original statement only tells us that when P is true, then Q will also be true (P \u2192 Q). However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between P, R, and Q.\n7. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer the new conditional statement based on the given one alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
