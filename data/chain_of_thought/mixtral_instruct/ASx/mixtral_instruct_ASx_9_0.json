Given: If the ploofle is blorped, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\n2. This can be represented as: Ploofle being blorped (P) -> Fliggle getting a nurple (N)\n3. Now, we are asked if we can infer that if the ploofle is both blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\n4. This new conditional statement adds another condition to the antecedent: Ploofle being blorped (P) AND Zooned (Z) -> Fliggle getting a nurple (N)\n5. The original statement only tells us about the relationship between the ploofle being blorped and the fliggle getting a nurple, but it doesn't provide any information about whether or not the zooning of the ploofle affects the outcome.\n6. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that if the ploofle is both blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
