Given statement: \"If the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked.\"\n2. Proposed inferred statement: \"If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the given statement to understand its implications:\n- The given statement only tells us that if a krimp is present in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked. It does not provide any information about other conditions or requirements for the snarf to be glonked.\n\nNow let's consider the proposed inferred statement:\n- The proposed inferred statement adds an additional condition (the zool being zapped) to the given statement. However, since the original statement does not mention anything about the zool being zapped or any other conditions related to the zool, we cannot infer that adding this condition would still result in the snarf being glonked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that if the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
