Specifically, it says \"If the sprocket was cranked (P), then the sprocket was daggled (Q)\".\n3. We want to know if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled (not Q), then the sprocket was not cranked (not P)\".\n4. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n5. However, based on the information given, we cannot be certain that the sprocket can only be daggled when it is cranked or that it cannot be daggled for any other reason.\n6. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
