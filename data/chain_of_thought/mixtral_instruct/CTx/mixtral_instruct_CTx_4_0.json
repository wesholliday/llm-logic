            "content": " To answer this question, let's first understand the given statement:\n\nGiven: If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\". It does not explicitly state what happens when the condition (P) is not met. To infer the truth of the statement \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\", we need to consider whether its truth follows from the given statement.\n\nLet's analyze this new conditional statement:\n\nProposed: If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nThis is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not Q, then not P\". To determine if it follows from the given statement, let's examine possible scenarios using a truth table or by considering different cases:\n\n1. The fribble was snurgled and crinked (P and Q are true). This is consistent with the given statement but doesn't help us decide on the proposed statement.\n2. The fribble was not snurgled and did not crinkle (not P and not Q are true). In this case, both statements hold true.\n3. The fribble was snurgled but did not crinkle (P is true, Q is false). This scenario contradicts the given statement, so it's an invalid case.\n4. The fribble was not snurgled and crinkled (not P is true, Q is true). This scenario also contradicts the given statement, so it's an invalid case.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that when the fribble did not crinkle (not Q), the fribble was not snurgled (not P) in all valid scenarios. Therefore, the proposed conditional statement \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" follows logically from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
