            "content": " To answer this question, let's first understand the given statement:\n\nStatement: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\". It means that if the clug has some particular property (fleeked), then it will have another specific property (snugged).\n\nNow let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\nInference: \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nThis is called the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is logically equivalent to the original statement and can be derived as follows:\n\n1. Start with the given statement: \"If the clug was fleeked (p), then the clug snugged (q).\"\n2. To form the contrapositive, swap the hypothesis (p) and conclusion (q): \"If the clug did not snug (not q), then the clug was not fleeked (not p).\"\n\nSince the given statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer that if the clug did not snug, then it was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
