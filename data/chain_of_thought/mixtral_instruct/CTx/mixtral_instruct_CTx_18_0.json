The given statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This can be represented as: plooked(shank) -> nugged(shank).\n2. We want to determine if we can infer that \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked,\" which can be represented as: !nugged(shank) -> !plooked(shank).\n3. To establish this implication, we need to examine whether the negation of the consequent (the second part of the original statement) leads to the negation of the antecedent (the first part of the original statement).\n4. In other words, if it's not true that the shank was nugged, can we be sure that the shank was not plooked?\n5. The given statement only tells us what happens when the shank is plooked; it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the shank is not nugged.\n6. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
