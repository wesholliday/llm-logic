The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the sneg did not sprout the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n3. To form the contrapositive, we negate both the hypothesis and conclusion, and then swap their positions.\n4. In this case, since the original statement has the form \"if P, then Q,\" its contrapositive is indeed \"if not Q, then not P.\"\n5. Therefore, if we are certain that the original statement is true, then we can infer its contrapositive as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
