When the flugel is not zargled (\u00aczargled(flugel)): In this case, we cannot directly infer that the flugel was not blimmed because the given statement only tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. It does not tell us what happens when the flugel is not zargled.\n2. When the flugel is blimmed (blimmed(flugel)): According to the given statement, this implies that the flugel was zargled (zargled(flugel)). Therefore, if the flugel was not zargled (\u00aczargled(flugel)), then it cannot be blimmed.\n\nFrom these cases, we can see that the given statement does not allow us to infer the desired statement. The given statement only provides information about what happens when the flugel is blimmed, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
