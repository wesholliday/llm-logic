            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This is in the form of p -> q, where p represents \"the smip was shripped\" and q represents \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n2. The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be ~q -> ~p, or \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n3. To determine if we can make this inference, let's first review the truth table for a conditional statement (p -> q):\n   | p  | q  | p -> q |\n   |-----|---|--------|\n   | T   | T  |   T    |\n   | T   | F  |   F    |\n   | F   | T  |   T    |\n   | F   | F  |   T    |\n4. Notice that the only time a conditional statement is false is when p is true and q is false. In all other cases, the statement is true.\n5. Now let's examine the truth table for the contrapositive (~q -> ~p):\n   | ~q | ~p | ~q -> ~p |\n   |-----|----|---------|\n   | T   | T  |    T    |\n   | T   | F  |    F    |\n   | F   | T  |    T    |\n   | F   | F  |    T    |\n6. Again, notice that the only time the contrapositive is false is when ~q is true and ~p is false, which occurs when q is true and p is false.\n7. Since both the original statement (p -> q) and its contrapositive (~q -> ~p) have the same truth table, they are logically equivalent. This means that if the smip was shripped implies that the smip lupped the zoint, then it also follows that if the smip did not lup the zoint implies that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
