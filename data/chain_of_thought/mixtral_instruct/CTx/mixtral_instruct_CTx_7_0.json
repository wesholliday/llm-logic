We want to find out if we can infer that if the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked (let's denote this as ~Q -> ~P).\n3. To determine if ~Q -> ~P is true, let's examine two possible scenarios:\n   a) The whiffle tinked (Q is true): In this case, we cannot conclude anything about whether the whiffle was shanked or not (P could be either true or false).\n   b) The whiffle did not tink (~Q is true): We still cannot definitively say if the whiffle was shanked (P is unknown), as there might be other reasons for it not to tink.\n4. Since we cannot determine whether P is true or false based on ~Q alone, we cannot infer that ~Q -> ~P from the original statement P -> Q.\n\nAnswer: No.",
