            "content": " To answer this question, let's first understand what is given and what we want to find out.\n\nGiven:\n1) If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nWe want to determine if the following statement is true or not:\n2) If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTo do this, let's analyze both statements using logical reasoning.\n\nStatement 1 can be represented as \"Bluttered -> Surned\" (where '->' means 'implies'). This statement tells us that if the condition of being bluttered is true, then the consequence of surning must also be true.\n\nNow let's analyze Statement 2, which can be represented as \"Not(Surned) -> Not(Bluttered)\". This statement says that if the condition of not surning is true, then the consequence of not being bluttered must also be true.\n\nTo check whether Statement 2 is valid, we need to consider two cases for Statement 1: when it is true and when it is false.\n\nCase 1: When Statement 1 (Bluttered -> Surned) is true\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n- In this case, if the fleeg did not surn, then it must not have been bluttered either because Statement 1 tells us that bluttered implies surned. Therefore, in this case, Statement 2 (Not(Surned) -> Not(Bluttered)) is true.\n\nCase 2: When Statement 1 (Bluttered -> Surned) is false\n- This would mean that the fleeg was bluttered but did not surn. However, since we are given only one implication in Statement 1, there are no other conditions or possibilities mentioned for when the fleeg can be bluttered or surned. Therefore, this case cannot occur based on the information provided.\n\nSince Statement 2 is true in Case 1 and there is no valid scenario for Case 2, we can infer that Statement 2 (If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered) is generally true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
