Contrapositive: The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both its hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. If 'A -> B' is a conditional statement, then its contrapositive is '\u00acB -> \u00acA'. Importantly, if the original statement is true, so is its contrapositive.\n2. Logical equivalence: Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value under all possible interpretations of their variables. If A and B are logically equivalent, then 'A <-> B' represents this relationship (A if and only if B).\n\nNow, let's apply these concepts to our given statement:\n(B -> Z) is the original statement. Its contrapositive would be (\u00acZ -> \u00acB), which matches the inferred statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' based on the given statement because they are contrapositives of each other.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
