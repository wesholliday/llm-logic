The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both its hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is: \u00acquank(splat) \u2192 \u00acmorph(splat). This is exactly the same as the statement we want to infer! Since the given statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
