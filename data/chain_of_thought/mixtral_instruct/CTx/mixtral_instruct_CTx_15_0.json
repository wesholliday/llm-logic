            "content": " Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\". \n   - P represents \"the dreb was vroombed\"\n   - Q represents \"the dreb was spened\"\n\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be: \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" This is also a conditional statement in the form of \"if not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. To find the contrapositive, we negate both parts of the original statement and reverse their order:\n   - Original statement: If P (dreb was vroombed), then Q (dreb was spened)\n   - Negated statements: Not P (dreb was not vroombed), Not Q (dreb was not spened)\n   - Reversed order: If Not Q (dreb was not spened), then Not P (dreb was not vroombed)\n\n4. Based on our analysis, we can indeed infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" as it is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
