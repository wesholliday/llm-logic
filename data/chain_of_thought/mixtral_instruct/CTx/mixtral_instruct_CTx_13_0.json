            "content": " Let's break down this problem step by step:\n\n1. We are given a conditional statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This is also known as a material implication, where if the antecedent (the first part before 'then') is true, the consequent (the second part after 'then') must be true.\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true: \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n3. To form the contrapositive, we negate both the antecedent and consequent of the original statement and then switch their positions. So, for the given statement, the contrapositive would be: \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n4. The truth of a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that is, if one is true, so is the other, and if one is false, so is the other.\n5. In this case, since we have correctly formed the contrapositive of the given statement, they must be logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
