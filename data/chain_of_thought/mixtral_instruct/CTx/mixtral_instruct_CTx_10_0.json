            "content": " To answer this question, let's first understand the given statement:\n\nGiven statement: If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer the following conditional statement:\nIf the wug was not garbled, then the wug was not sproinged.\n\nTo do this, let's analyze both statements using a truth table or logical reasoning:\n\n1. Let's consider the given statement: If the wug was sproinged (P), then it was garbled (Q). This is a form of implication, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n2. Now let's analyze the statement we want to infer: If the wug was not garbled (\u00acQ), then the wug was not sproinged (\u00acP).\n3. To check if the given statement implies the inferred statement, we can use contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. If the given statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n4. Since our inferred statement is the same as the contrapositive of the given statement, if the given statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on logical reasoning, we can infer 'If the wug was not garbled, then the wug was not sproinged' from 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
