This is a conditional statement where the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn.\n2. The second premise confirms that the unicorn was indeed in the forest.\n3. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n4. Given the two premises, the griffin's presence isn't guaranteed, but the conclusion assumes its presence.\n5. The argument fails to establish a connection between the unicorn's confirmed presence and the griffin's presence.\n\nAnswer: No.",
