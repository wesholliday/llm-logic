            "content": "Step 1: Identify the logical structure of the argument.\n- The argument has a conditional statement as its first premise, which can be written in the form 'P \u2192 Q'.\n- The second premise is a simple statement, 'Q'.\n- The conclusion is also a simple statement, 'P'.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of logical validity. An argument is logically valid if and only if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false.\n\nStep 3: Test the argument for validity by assuming the truth of the premises and checking whether the conclusion must be true.\n- Assume the first premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' (P \u2192 Q) is true.\n- Assume the second premise 'Jen watched basketball' (Q) is true.\n\nStep 4: Based on these assumptions, evaluate the truth of the conclusion 'Tom watched football' (P).\n- Since the first premise is a conditional statement and its antecedent (P) has not been ruled out as false, we cannot conclude that the antecedent must be true.\n- However, if the second premise 'Jen watched basketball' (Q) is true, then it does not necessarily mean that the first premise's antecedent 'Tom watched football' (P) is also true. The first premise only states a *conditional* relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n- Thus, given the truth of the premises, the conclusion could be false.\n\nStep 5: Since it is possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
