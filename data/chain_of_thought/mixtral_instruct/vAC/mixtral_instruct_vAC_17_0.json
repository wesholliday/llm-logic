In this case, let P be 'Ben ate pasta' and Q be 'Kate ate salad'.\n3. So the first premise is 'If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (Q)'. The second premise is 'Kate ate salad (Q)'.\n4. To determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n5. In this case, the conclusion is 'Ben ate pasta (P)'.\n6. Given the first and second premises, it does indeed follow that Ben must have eaten pasta for Kate to have eaten salad.\n7. Therefore, the argument is valid in form.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
