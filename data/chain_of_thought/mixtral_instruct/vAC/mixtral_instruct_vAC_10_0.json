The second premise confirms that Q (the cat was outside) is true.\n3. From these two premises, we can infer that P (the dog was inside) must be true because the first premise states that if P is true, then Q will be true, and in this case, we know that Q is true.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that P (the dog was inside) is logically valid based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
