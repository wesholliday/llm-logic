In this case, P represents 'Sam took a plane' and Q represents 'Erin took a train'.\n3. According to the rules of logic, if both premises are true in a hypothetical syllogism, then the conclusion must also be true.\n4. Here, the second premise (Q) is given as true: 'Erin took a train'.\n5. If Erin took a train and the first premise is true, then Sam must have taken a plane.\n6. Therefore, if both premises are true, the conclusion 'Sam took a plane' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
