(Implication)\n- Premise 2: The book is a mystery novel. (Fact)\n- Conclusion: The book was written by James. (Inference)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument for logical validity.\nAn argument is logically valid if and only if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical principles to test the argument's validity.\nIn this case, we can use Modus Ponens, which states that if \"P \u2192 Q\" (if P then Q) is true and P is also true, then Q must be true.\n\nHere, let P = \"The book was written by James,\" and Q = \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n- Premise 2: Q (The book is a mystery novel)\n\nApplying Modus Ponens, we can deduce that P must be true. Therefore, the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
