This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if p then q.\"\n2. The second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt. This confirms the consequent of our conditional statement in the first premise.\n3. The conclusion is that Lisa bought the red shirt. However, this is not necessarily true based on the given premises.\n4. Just because the consequent of a conditional statement is true, it does not mean that the antecedent must also be true. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy.\n5. Therefore, even though Mark did buy the blue shirt, we cannot definitively say that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
