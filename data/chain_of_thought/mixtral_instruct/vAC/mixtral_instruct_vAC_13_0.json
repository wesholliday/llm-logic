This is a conditional statement where the car's color being red is the antecedent and the truck's color being blue is the consequent.\n2. The second premise asserts that the truck was blue.\n3. The conclusion claims that the car was red.\n4. However, even though the second premise (truck being blue) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the first premise's condition (car being red) is also true. There could be other reasons for the truck to be blue.\n5. Therefore, just because the conclusion follows logically from the second premise alone, it doesn't follow logically when considering both premises together.\n\nAnswer: No.",
