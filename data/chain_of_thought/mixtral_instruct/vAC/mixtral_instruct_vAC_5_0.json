The argument has the form \"If P, then Q; Q; therefore P.\"\n\nStep 2: Recall that in a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n\nStep 3: Consider whether this is always the case for arguments with the structure \"If P, then Q; Q; therefore P.\"\n\nStep 4: Notice that if the first premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true and the second premise \"Amy played tennis\" is also true, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to whether or not Jeff played basketball.\n\nStep 5: Conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid because there are cases where the premises can be true and the conclusion false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
