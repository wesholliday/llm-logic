This is a conditional statement where the condition (A) is 'the apple was red' and the consequence (B) is 'the banana was yellow'.\n2. The second premise confirms that B is true; in other words, the banana was indeed yellow.\n3. However, just because B is true does not necessarily mean A is true. This can be seen more clearly if we substitute A and B with different statements. For example, consider the argument: \"If it is raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). The ground is wet (B). Therefore, it must be raining (A).\" Clearly, there could be other reasons why the ground is wet besides rain.\n4. So, even though we know that B is true in this case (the banana was yellow), we cannot definitively conclude that A is also true (the apple was red). There might be other explanations for why the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
