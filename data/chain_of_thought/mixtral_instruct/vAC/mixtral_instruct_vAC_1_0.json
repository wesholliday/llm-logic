This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n3. To determine whether this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether it's possible for the conclusion (Mary was at the wedding) to be false while both premises are true.\n4. Given the second premise (Sue was at the wedding), if the conditional statement in the first premise were also true, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n5. Therefore, it's not possible for the conclusion to be false when both premises are true, which means the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
