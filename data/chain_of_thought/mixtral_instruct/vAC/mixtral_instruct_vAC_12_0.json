            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that Lucy went to the zoo, which matches the consequent (Q) of our conditional statement from step 1.\n3. Our conclusion is stating that Joe went to the park, which matches the antecedent (P) of our conditional statement from step 1.\n4. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, it does because we are given that Lucy went to the zoo and our conditional statement tells us that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy will go to the zoo.\n5. Therefore, since the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion, this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
