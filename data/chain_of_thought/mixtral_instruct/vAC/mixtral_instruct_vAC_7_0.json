This is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then q\".\n2. The second premise asserts that the proposition 'Chris finished the race' (q) is true.\n3. Now we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from these two premises. To do this, let's assume the opposite of the conclusion and see if it leads to a contradiction:\n   - Suppose Alex did not finish the race (not p).\n   - According to the first premise, if Alex finished the race then Chris also finished the race. But since we assumed that Alex didn't finish the race, this conditional statement doesn't apply here.\n   - However, the second premise tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race (q).\n   - Since both premises are true and they don't contradict each other, it is possible for Alex not to have finished the race even if Chris did.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of its premises does not guarantee the truth of its conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
