This is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second premise confirms that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n3. To determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n4. In this case, if the first and second premises are true, then it would mean that the condition in the first premise has been met (since the muffins were blueberry), which implies that the cake must have been chocolate.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion 'The cake was chocolate' does logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
