            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement where the condition (doll being plastic) leads to a consequence (truck being metal).\n2. The second premise confirms that the truck was indeed metal.\n3. To determine whether the conclusion logically follows from these premises, we apply Modus Ponens, a rule of inference where if 'P -> Q' and P are both true, then Q must be true.\n4. In this case, the argument can be rephrased as: If P (doll is plastic), then Q (truck is metal). Q (truck is metal) is given. Therefore, P (doll is plastic).\n5. Since Modus Ponens has been correctly applied, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
