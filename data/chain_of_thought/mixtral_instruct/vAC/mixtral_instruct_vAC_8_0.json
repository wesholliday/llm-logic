In this case, P represents 'the vampire was awake' and Q represents 'the mummy was awake.'\n3. The first premise can be rewritten as \"If P, then Q,\" which matches the first part of Modus Ponens.\n4. The second premise is \"Q,\" which matches the second part of Modus Ponens.\n5. Therefore, if the argument follows the structure of Modus Ponens and both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
