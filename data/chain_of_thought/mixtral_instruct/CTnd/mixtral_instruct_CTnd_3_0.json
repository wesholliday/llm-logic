            "content": " Let's think through this logically:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\" This can be written as P -> Q, where P represents 'I ate a meal' and Q represents 'I did not eat a large meal.'\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true: ~Q -> ~P, or in English, \"If I did not eat a small meal, then I ate a large meal.\"\n3. However, the original statement does not preclude the possibility that you could have eaten both a small meal and a large meal. It only states that if you ate a meal (of any size), then you didn't eat a large meal.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
