The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if P then not Q\", where P represents 'the room was cleaned' and Q represents 'it was cleaned thoroughly'.\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the converse of this statement, which would be \"if Q then not P\".\n3. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. The original statement only tells us what happens when the room is cleaned but not cleaned thoroughly; it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the room is cleaned thoroughly.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\n\nAnswer: No.",
