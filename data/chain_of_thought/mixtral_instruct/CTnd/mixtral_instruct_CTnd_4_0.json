The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if p then not q\", where p represents \"Ben studied\" and q represents \"Ben studied diligently\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be \"if q then not p\".\n3. However, the given statement does not allow us to make this inference because it does not provide sufficient information about what happens when Ben studies diligently. It only tells us about a situation where he doesn't study diligently after studying.\n4. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot infer that 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
