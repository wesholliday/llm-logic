The original statement is in the form of a contrapositive, which means it's already in an \"if-then\" format and is logically equivalent to its converse (the statement you provided).\n2. However, just because two statements are logically equivalent does not mean they convey the same meaning or message.\n3. In this case, the original statement implies that if clothes were washed, there was some issue with how they were washed.\n4. The proposed statement, on the other hand, suggests that even if the clothes were washed properly, they still weren't washed at all. This is clearly not what the original statement meant.\n\nAnswer: No.",
