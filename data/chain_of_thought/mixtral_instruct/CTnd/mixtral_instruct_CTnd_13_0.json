If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\nThis is a contrapositive of \"If Alex did not exercise much, then he exercised.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the proposed statement:\n\n2. If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\nThis statement is simply saying that if Alex exercised a lot, it's still true that he didn't exercise at all, which is contradictory.\n\nSo, based on our analysis of both statements, we cannot infer the proposed statement because it creates a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: No.",
