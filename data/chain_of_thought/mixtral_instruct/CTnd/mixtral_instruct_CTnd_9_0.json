The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" Here, P represents \"instructions were given\" and Q represents \"they were not explained clearly.\"\n2. We want to find out if the converse of this statement is true: \"If Q, then P.\" In other words, we're asking if \"They were explained clearly\" (not Q) implies \"Instructions were given\" (P).\n3. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that if instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given. It only tells us what happens when instructions are given but not explained clearly.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
