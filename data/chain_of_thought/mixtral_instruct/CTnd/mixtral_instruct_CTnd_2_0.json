The original statement is in the form \"if A, then not B\", where A represents \"Ann exercised\" and B represents \"Ann exercised strenuously\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer \"if B, then not A\".\n3. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. \n4. The original statement only tells us what happens when Ann exercises (A), but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when she exercises strenuously (B).\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"if B, then not A\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
