The given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if P then Q\", where P represents \"the issue was addressed\" and Q represents \"it was not addressed effectively\".\n2. We want to determine if we can infer another conditional statement from this, specifically \"if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\". This is written as \"if P' then not-Q\", where P' represents \"the issue was addressed effectively\" and not-Q represents \"it was not addressed\".\n3. To infer \"if P' then not-Q\" from \"if P then Q\", we would need to assume that addressing a problem effectively is the same as simply addressing it, i.e., P implies P'. However, this is not necessarily true because an issue can be addressed without being addressed effectively.\n4. Therefore, since we cannot make the assumption that P implies P', we cannot infer \"if P' then not-Q\" from \"if P then Q\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
