The original statement is in the form \"if p then not q\", where p represents \"a recommendation was made\" and q represents \"it was a strong recommendation\".\n2. We want to determine if the statement \"if q then not p\" is true based on this information.\n3. To do this, let's consider two cases: one where a recommendation was made but it wasn't strong, and another where a strong recommendation was made.\n4. In the first case, where a recommendation was made but it wasn't strong, the original statement \"if p then not q\" holds true.\n5. However, in the second case, where a strong recommendation was made, the original statement does not apply because we are given that if a recommendation was made at all (whether strong or not), then it was not a strong recommendation.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"if q then not p\" is true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
