The given statement is \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully.\" This is in the form of a conditional statement P -> ~Q, where P represents 'the meal was prepared' and Q represents 'it was prepared carefully'.\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true: ~Q -> ~P, or in other words, 'if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared'.\n3. However, this conclusion does not follow from the original statement. The original statement says that if the meal was prepared at all, then it was not prepared carefully. It does not imply that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it wasn't prepared. In fact, these two statements are contradictory.\n\nAnswer: No.",
