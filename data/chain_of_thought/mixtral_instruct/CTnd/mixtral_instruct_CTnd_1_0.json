The given statement is \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This is a conditional statement where the condition (raining) leads to a conclusion (not raining hard).\n2. We want to determine if we can infer the converse of this statement: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\"\n3. The converse switches the condition and the conclusion from the original statement.\n4. However, the given statement does not necessarily mean that if it's raining hard, it cannot be raining at all. It only states that light rain is occurring when it's raining.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
