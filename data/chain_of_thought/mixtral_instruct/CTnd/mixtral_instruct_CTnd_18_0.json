This statement represents a contrapositive form of an original conditional statement, which would be: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n3. However, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement only when the original statement is true.\n4. In this case, the given statement is not necessarily true; therefore, we cannot assume that its contrapositive form is also true.\n5. The difference between the two statements lies in their conditions: the first one implies that a discussion took place but lacked depth, while the second one suggests that if there was depth, then no discussion occurred at all.\n6. Thus, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.'\n\nAnswer: No.",
