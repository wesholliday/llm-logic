The original statement is \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\" This means that every time advice was offered, it was not helpful.\n2. We want to determine if the statement \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" is true based on this information.\n3. To do this, let's consider two scenarios: one where only unhelpful advice is offered and another where both helpful and unhelpful advice are offered.\n4. In the first scenario (only unhelpful advice offered), the original statement holds true, but the second statement does not hold true because some advice was indeed offered.\n5. In the second scenario (both helpful and unhelpful advice offered), neither statement holds true because if helpful advice is offered, it contradicts the original statement, and if unhelpful advice is offered, it contradicts the second statement.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
