We have the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an example of a conditional statement, often referred to as a logical implication or an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second statement given is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n3. To determine if we can logically conclude that \"The book was written by James,\" we need to consider whether the given statements and information support this conclusion.\n4. In this case, while it's true that *if* the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel, the second statement only tells us that the book is a mystery novel. It does not necessarily follow that James wrote the book. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
