            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and use logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as p -> q, where p represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is that \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is true (q).\n3. Now we want to find out if we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt (p) based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (~p). If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then according to the first statement, there is no guarantee that Mark bought the blue shirt (q). However, we know from the second statement that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt.\n5. Since Mark buying the blue shirt (q) is true and cannot be false based on the given information, this means that Lisa must have bought the red shirt (p) to satisfy the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
