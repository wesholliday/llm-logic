            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and use logical reasoning:\n\n1. Given statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (We can write this as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\")\n2. Also given: Sue was at the wedding. (This is a fact stated directly.)\n\nNow let's analyze these statements using logical principles:\n\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. In formal logic, it can be represented as \"Mary implies Sue\" or \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too.\n- However, this does not mean that Sue's presence guarantees Mary's presence. It only tells us that if Mary were present, Sue would also be present.\n- The second statement confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding. But it doesn't tell us anything about Mary's presence directly.\n\nGiven these two statements and our analysis, we cannot logically conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding'. Although Sue's presence is a necessary condition for Mary's presence (because if Mary were present, Sue would be too), it does not guarantee that Mary was actually present.\n\nAnswer: No.",
