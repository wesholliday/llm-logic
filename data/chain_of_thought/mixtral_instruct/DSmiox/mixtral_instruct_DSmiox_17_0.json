We have the statement \"The flob might not be movated.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the flob could still be movated.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true: either the flob is skizzled, or it must be movated.\n3. From the first statement, we know that there's a chance the flob might not be movated. So if the flob isn't required to be movated, then the other condition in the second statement must be true: the flob is skizzled.\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
