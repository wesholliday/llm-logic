We have the statement \"The flugel might not be zargled.\" This implies that there is a possibility for the flugel to not be zargled, meaning it could be in some other state.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" This means that the only two possible states for the flugel are being blimmed or being zargled.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that there is a possibility for the flugel to not be zargled, and the second statement tells us that if the flugel isn't zargled, then it must be blimmed, we can infer that the flugel being blimmed is indeed a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
