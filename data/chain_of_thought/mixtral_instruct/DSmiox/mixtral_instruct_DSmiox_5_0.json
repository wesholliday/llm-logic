This statement implies that there is a possibility for the zinger to not be smoogled, which means it could either be fraggled or have some other status besides being smoogled.\n2. The second statement is 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled'. This statement presents two possibilities: a) The zinger is fraggled or b) If the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that there is a possibility for the zinger to not be smoogled, this means option (b) cannot be true. Therefore, option (a) must be true: The zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
