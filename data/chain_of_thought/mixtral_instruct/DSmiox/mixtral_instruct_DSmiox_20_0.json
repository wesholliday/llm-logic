The first statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the fleeg could be surned.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This means that one of two conditions must hold true: either the fleeg is bluttered, or it must be surned.\n\nNow let's consider whether we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' based on these statements:\n\nFrom the first statement alone, we cannot conclude that the fleeg is bluttered because it only tells us about the possibility of the fleeg not being surned. The second statement introduces a new condition, which is the fleeg being bluttered. However, this statement also doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the fleeg is indeed bluttered since it could still be surned.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
