It could still be the case that the book is a mystery novel but was written by someone other than James.\n\nStep 4: However, if we assume that the only books James writes are mystery novels, then it would follow that if the book is not a mystery novel, it could not have been written by James. This is an example of logical reasoning called contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes, if we assume that James only writes mystery novels, then we can infer that the book was not written by James based on the given information.",
