This is a conditional statement where the presence of Mary implies the presence of Sue.\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n3. From these two statements, we cannot definitively say that Mary was not at the wedding because the first statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue had to be there as well. It doesn't tell us anything about when Mary isn't present.\n\nAnswer: No.",
