We are given the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The next statement is \"it's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This means that it's possible for the truck to be any color other than blue.\n3. If the truck can be any color other than blue, then the condition stated in the first sentence (\"If the car was red\") cannot be true because if it were, the truck would have to be blue (which we know is not the case).\n4. Therefore, the original statement \"the car was red\" must be false, meaning the car could not have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
