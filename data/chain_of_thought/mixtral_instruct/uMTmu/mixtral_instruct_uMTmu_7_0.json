This is a conditional statement where finishing the race for Alex implies that Chris also finished the race.\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex did not finish the race because the first statement only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris also did; it doesn't tell us whether or not Alex actually finished. Additionally, the second statement does not contradict the possibility of Alex finishing the race since it only states that Chris might not have finished.\n\nAnswer: No.",
