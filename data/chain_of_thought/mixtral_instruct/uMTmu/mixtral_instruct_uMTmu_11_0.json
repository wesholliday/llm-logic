This is a conditional statement where the presence of chocolate cake implies the existence of blueberry muffins.\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means there could be other types of muffins, not just blueberry ones.\n3. From these two statements, we cannot definitively say whether the cake was chocolate or not because the second statement contradicts the condition stated in the first one.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information.",
