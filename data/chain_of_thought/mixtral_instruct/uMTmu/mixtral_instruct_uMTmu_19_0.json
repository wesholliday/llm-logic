            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We know that \"if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"Tom -> Jen\" (where '->' represents 'implies').\n2. However, we are also told that \"it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this means 'not Jen'.\n3. From these two pieces of information, we want to determine if 'not Tom' is true (i.e., Tom did not watch football).\n4. If Jen didn't watch basketball, then according to the first statement, Tom shouldn't have watched football either. This is because if the condition (Tom watching football) for the implication is false, the truth value of the whole implication doesn't matter.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'not Tom' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
