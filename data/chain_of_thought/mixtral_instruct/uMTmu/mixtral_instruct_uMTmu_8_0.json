            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This is a conditional statement where the vampire being awake leads to the necessary conclusion that the mummy is also awake.\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that there are instances where the mummy is not awake, which contradicts the first statement if we assume the vampire was awake.\n3. Can we infer that the vampire was not awake? Yes, because if the mummy can be asleep while the condition for the vampire to be awake leads to a contradiction, then it must be the case that the vampire is also asleep.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
