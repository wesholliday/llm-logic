It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the statement \"If A, then B\" cannot be true because its contrapositive would also be false (i.e., if not B, then not A).\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If she had, then according to the first statement, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts what we know.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
