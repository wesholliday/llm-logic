It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nFrom point 1, we can infer that if the shirt being cotton leads to the necessary conclusion that the pants are denim, then the opposite should also hold true - if the pants are not denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that the pants are not necessarily denim. Therefore, based on the conditional statement in point 1, it follows that the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
