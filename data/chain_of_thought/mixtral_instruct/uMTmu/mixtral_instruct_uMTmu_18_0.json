            "content": " Step 1: We are given the conditional statement \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a type of logical statement known as a hypothetical or conditional statement.\n\nStep 2: The second piece of information we are given is that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the truck could have been made of some other material besides metal, or it may not have existed at all.\n\nStep 3: To determine whether we can infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. If the first statement were true (that is, if the doll were plastic), then the second statement would be false (since the truck must be metal). However, since the second statement is not true (the truck does not have to be metal), it follows that the first statement cannot be true either.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic, because if it were, then the truck would have had to be metal, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
