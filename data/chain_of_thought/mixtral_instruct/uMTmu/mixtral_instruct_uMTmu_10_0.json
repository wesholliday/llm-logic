The first is \"if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as 'if p, then q'.\n\nStep 2: The second piece of information we're given is \"it's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This can be translated as \"not q\" or \"the cat was not necessarily outside.\"\n\nStep 3: From \"if p, then q\", we know that if the dog (p) was inside, then the cat (q) would have to be outside. But since we're told \"not q\", meaning it's not the case that the cat must have been outside, this implies that the first condition (p) cannot be true.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, if the dog being inside leads to a contradiction with the given information, then we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
