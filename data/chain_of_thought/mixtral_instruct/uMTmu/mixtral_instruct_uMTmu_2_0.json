This is a conditional statement where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This means that it's possible for the unicorn to be somewhere else, not necessarily in the forest.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest because the first statement only tells us that if the griffin was there, then the unicorn would also be there. It doesn't tell us anything about when the griffin is not present in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No.",
