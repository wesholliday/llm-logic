We are given the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n2. However, we are also told that \"it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This negates the previous conditional statement.\n3. Therefore, the opposite of the original conditional statement must be true: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n4. Given that the banana was not necessarily yellow, it could have been another color, and thus the apple could also be another color besides red.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the apple was not red.",
