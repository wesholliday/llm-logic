This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"p implies q\" where p = 'Joe went to the park' and q = 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n2. The second premise confirms that Joe did indeed go to the park (p is true).\n3. Given that p is true, and according to our first premise, if p then q, we can infer that q must also be true.\n4. Therefore, since Lucy going to the zoo (q) logically follows from the two given premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
