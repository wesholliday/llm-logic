This is a Modus Ponens argument, which has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: P\nConclusion: Q\n\nStep 2: Substitute the given premises into the argument form.\n\nPremise 1: If Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q)\nPremise 2: Tom watched football (P)\n\nStep 3: Apply Modus Ponens to determine if the argument is valid.\n\nModus Ponens states that if both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, Premise 1 is a conditional statement, and Premise 2 provides the truth value of the antecedent (P). Since Premise 2 is true, we can infer that the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
