In this case, P represents 'Sue chose pizza', and Q represents 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\n3. The first premise states that if Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q). This is a conditional statement where the truth of the conclusion (Q) depends on the truth of the premise (P).\n\n4. The second premise asserts that Sue did indeed choose pizza (P).\n\n5. Given the first and second premises, we can infer that Bob chose pasta (Q), because if Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob must have chosen pasta (Q).\n\n6. Therefore, the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
