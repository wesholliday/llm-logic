This is a conditional statement, often referred to as 'p implies q' where p represents 'the griffin was in the forest' and q represents 'the unicorn was in the forest'.\n2. The second premise affirms that the griffin was indeed in the forest (p is true).\n3. Given that p is true, and according to our first premise, if p then q, we can infer that q must also be true.\n4. Therefore, since the unicorn's presence in the forest (q) logically follows from the given premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
