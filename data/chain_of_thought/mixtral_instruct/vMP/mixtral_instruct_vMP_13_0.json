In this case, P represents \"the car was red\" and Q represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n3. According to the rules of logic, if both premises are true in a hypothetical syllogism, then the conclusion must also be true.\n4. Here, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise affirms the antecedent of that statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the rules of logic, the conclusion necessarily follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
