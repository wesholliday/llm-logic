This is a conditional statement known as a hypothetical syllogism.\n2. The second premise confirms that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n3. Given the truth of the second premise, we can apply modus ponens to the first premise, which allows us to infer the consequent of the conditional statement (i.e., the muffins were blueberry).\n4. Therefore, if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
