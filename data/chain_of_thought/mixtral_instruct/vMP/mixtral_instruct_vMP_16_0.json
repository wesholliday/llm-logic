In this case, P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n3. According to the rules of logic, if both premises are true in a hypothetical syllogism, then the conclusion must also be true.\n4. Here, the first premise sets up a conditional statement, and the second premise affirms the antecedent (the 'if' part) of that statement.\n5. Therefore, if both premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
