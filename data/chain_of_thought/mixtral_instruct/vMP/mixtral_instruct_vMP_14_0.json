The second premise asserts that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, namely, the bear was in the cave.\n3. Given the truth of the antecedent and the nature of the conditional statement, we can infer the consequent to be true: the wolf was in the den.\n4. This form of argument follows a valid pattern called modus ponens, where if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
