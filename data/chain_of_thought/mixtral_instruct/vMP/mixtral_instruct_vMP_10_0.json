The second premise affirms the antecedent, stating that P (the dog was inside) is true.\n3. Given the truth of the second premise, and applying Modus Ponens to the first premise, we can infer that Q (the cat was outside) must also be true.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'The cat was outside' logically follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
