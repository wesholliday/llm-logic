            "content": "Step 1: Identify the form of the argument. This is a Modus Ponens argument, where the structure is as follows:\n- Premise 1: If P, then Q\n- Premise 2: P\n- Conclusion: Q\n\nStep 2: Understand the truth table for conditionals (if-then statements). A true conditional only has a false conclusion when its antecedent (the 'if' part) is false. In all other cases, the conditional is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the premises to the argument form. Here, P = 'Jeff played basketball', and Q = 'Amy played tennis'. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (P -> Q). The second premise confirms that Jeff did indeed play basketball (P).\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion based on the argument form. Since both premises are true and this is a Modus Ponens argument, we can conclude that Amy played tennis (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
