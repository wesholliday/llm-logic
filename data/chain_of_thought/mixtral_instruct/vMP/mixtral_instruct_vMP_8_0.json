In our given argument, P represents 'the vampire was awake' and Q represents 'the mummy was awake.'\n3. The first premise matches the conditional part of the modus ponens structure (i.e., 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake').\n4. The second premise matches the antecedent part of the modus ponens structure (i.e., 'The vampire was awake').\n5. Given that both premises align with the structure of modus ponens, if these premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
