This is also known as a hypothetical proposition or a \"hypothetical syllogism.\"\n2. The second premise affirms that the condition in the first premise is true - that Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n3. Given these two premises, we can infer that Sue must have been at the wedding as well because if Mary's presence implies Sue's presence (first premise), and Mary was present (second premise), then it follows that Sue must also have been present.\n4. This form of argument is called a valid deductive argument, specifically a hypothetical syllogism. A valid argument is one where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
