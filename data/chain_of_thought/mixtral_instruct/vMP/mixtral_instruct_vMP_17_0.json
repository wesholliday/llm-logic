In this case, P represents 'Ben ate pasta' and Q represents 'Kate ate salad'.\n3. The first premise states 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad', which is equivalent to 'If P, then Q'.\n4. The second premise states 'Ben ate pasta', which is equivalent to 'P'.\n5. Given the two premises, we can infer 'Kate ate salad', which is equivalent to 'Q'.\n6. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of a valid form called hypothetical syllogism.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
