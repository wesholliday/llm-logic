If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n2. The second premise confirms that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt.\n3. Given the first and second premises, we can infer that since Lisa bought the red shirt, it follows logically that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (because if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
