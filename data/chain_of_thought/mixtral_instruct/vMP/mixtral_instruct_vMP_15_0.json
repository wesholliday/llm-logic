In Modus Ponens, the structure is as follows: if P, then Q; P; therefore Q.\n3. Here, 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' corresponds to 'if P, then Q'.\n4. 'Sam took a plane' corresponds to 'P'.\n5. And 'Erin took a train' corresponds to 'Q'.\n6. Given the structure of Modus Ponens and the correspondence between its elements and those in the given argument form, if both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n7. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
