This is a conditional statement where the condition (doll being plastic) leads to a consequence (truck being metal).\n2. The second premise confirms that the doll was indeed plastic.\n3. Given the truth of the second premise, we can apply Modus Ponens, a rule of inference in logic which states: if p -> q is true and p is true, then q must be true.\n4. In this case, p represents 'the doll was plastic' and q represents 'the truck was metal'. Since both the premises are true, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
