In other words, it's saying that there is no rule or necessity for the shoes to be inside the closet.\n\nNow let's consider the suggested inferred statement: \"The shoes might not be in the closet.\"\n\nThis statement expresses a possibility or uncertainty about the location of the shoes.\n\nGiven the original statement, we can indeed infer the suggested statement because if there is no requirement for the shoes to be in the closet, then it opens up the possibility that they could be located elsewhere. Therefore, the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
