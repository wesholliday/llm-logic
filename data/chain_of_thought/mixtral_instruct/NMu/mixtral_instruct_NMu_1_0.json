This implies there is no obligation or requirement for her to attend.\n2. Now, let's consider the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests that there is a possibility or uncertainty regarding Mary's presence at the wedding.\n3. Since the first statement indicates that it is possible for Mary to be absent from the wedding, we can infer that the second statement is also true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
