It does not explicitly state that Sue did not choose pizza, but rather leaves open the possibility of other options.\n\nNow let's consider the inferred statement: \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"\n\nThis statement is expressing the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. \n\nComparing these two statements, we can see that the inferred statement aligns logically with the given statement. By denying the certainty of Sue choosing pizza, it implies that there is room for other possibilities, including the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, the inferred statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" follows logically from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
