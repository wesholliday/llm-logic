Given statement: \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n2. This statement is denying a necessity claim, which means it asserts that the book does not need to be written by James.\n3. Now let's consider the inferred statement: \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\n4. This statement expresses a possibility - that there is a chance the book was not written by James.\n5. Since the given statement denies the necessity of James being the author, it implies that there is room for other possibilities, such as the book being written by someone else.\n6. Therefore, the inferred statement can be logically deduced from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
