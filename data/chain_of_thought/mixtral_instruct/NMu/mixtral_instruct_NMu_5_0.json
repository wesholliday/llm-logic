            "content": " To approach this question, let's first break down the given statement and then examine whether the inferred statement follows logically.\n\nGiven statement: \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\"\n\nThis statement is denying the necessity or certainty of Jeff having played basketball. It does not explicitly state that Jeff did not play, but it implies that there is some level of uncertainty or possibility for another outcome.\n\nInferred statement: \"Jeff might not have played basketball.\"\n\nTo determine if this inferred statement follows logically from the given statement, let's consider their relationship. The given statement denies the certainty of Jeff playing basketball, which implies that there is room for uncertainty or alternative possibilities. The inferred statement simply expresses this uncertainty by stating that it's possible Jeff did not play.\n\nSince the inferred statement accurately reflects the uncertainty and possibility expressed in the given statement, we can infer 'Jeff might not have played basketball' from 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
