We want to see if the contrapositive of the given statement is equivalent to the desired conclusion. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" is \"if not Q then not P\".\n\nGiven statement: sploff(grommet) \u2192 \u00acplop(grommet, frink)\nContrapositive: plop(grommet, frink) \u2192 \u00acsploff(grommet)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the given statement is equivalent to the desired conclusion, we can indeed infer that if the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
