This is a form of implication known as contrapositive. The original implication would be \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was blimmed\".\n2. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" from the given statement.\n3. This new statement is the converse of the original implication and its contrapositive. However, just because we have one implication does not automatically mean that its converse or contrapositive is also true.\n4. Without further information about the relationship between blimming and zargling a flugel, we cannot definitively conclude that \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
