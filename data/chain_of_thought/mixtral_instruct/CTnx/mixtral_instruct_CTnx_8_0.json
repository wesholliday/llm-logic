We are given a statement in the form \"If P, then not Q\", which is called a contrapositive of the statement \"If Q, then not P\".\n2. The original statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked (P), then the sprocket was not daggled (not Q)\".\n3. We want to know if we can infer the contrapositive statement \"If the sprocket was daggled (Q), then the sprocket was not cranked (not P)\".\n4. To determine this, let's consider whether these two statements are logically equivalent. They are indeed logically equivalent because they both represent the same relationship between the variables P and Q.\n5. Therefore, if we know that \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\", we can infer that \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
