This is a form of logical implication known as a contrapositive. The original implication can be written as \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" (let's call this statement A).\n3. The given statement is the contrapositive of statement A, which means it has the same truth value as statement A.\n4. Therefore, if the given statement is true, then statement A must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
