Consider the first statement: Sproinged \u27f9 \u00acGarbled\n   - This means that if a wug is sproinged, then it cannot be garbled at the same time.\n\n2. Now consider the second statement: Garbled \u27f9 \u00acSproinged\n   - This means that if a wug is garbled, then it cannot be sproinged at the same time.\n\nSince both statements describe mutually exclusive conditions (a wug cannot be both sproinged and garbled simultaneously), we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
