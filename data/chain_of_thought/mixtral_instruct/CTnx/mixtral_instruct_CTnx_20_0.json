            "content": " Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\". Here, P represents \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q represents \"it did not surn.\"\n2. Now we want to determine if we can infer \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered,\" which is also a conditional statement but in the form of \"if R, then S\". Here, R represents \"the fleeg surned\" and S represents \"the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n3. To infer from one conditional statement to another, we need to examine their logical relationships. In this case, we want to see if the truth of P implies the falsity of R (i.e., if the fleeg was bluttered, then it could not have surned).\n4. The given statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn\" indeed suggests that these two events are mutually exclusive; thus, if P is true, then R must be false.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
