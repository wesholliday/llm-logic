(P -> ~Q)\n\nStatement to infer: If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was not shanked. (Q -> ~P)\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first one, let's analyze their logical structures.\n\nThe given statement has an \"if-then\" structure where the condition is that the whiffle was shanked, and the consequence is that it did not tink. In other words, shanking the whiffle prevents it from tinking.\n\nNow let's examine the second statement. It also has an \"if-then\" structure, but with a different condition (the whiffle tinked) and a different consequence (it was not shanked).\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first one, we need to establish a connection between their logical structures. Specifically, we must show that if the whiffle tinking implies that it was not shanked, then the given statement allows us to make this inference.\n\nHowever, the given statement only tells us about the relationship between shanking and tinking when shanking causes non-tinking. It does not provide any information about what happens if the whiffle tinks. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the whiffle tinked, then it was not shanked based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
