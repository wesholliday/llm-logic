We know that \"if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" in logic.\n2. We also know that \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n3. From the given information, we cannot conclude that Tom did not watch football because the first statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen would watch basketball. It doesn't tell us what happens when Jen does not watch basketball.\n4. Therefore, it is possible that Tom still watched football even though Jen didn't watch basketball, or Tom might have not watched football at all. The given information is insufficient to determine whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
