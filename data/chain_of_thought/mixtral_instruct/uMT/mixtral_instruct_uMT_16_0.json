We have the statement \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - Shirt = Cotton \u2192 Pants = Denim\n   \n2. Then we are told that \"the pants were not denim.\"\n   - Pants \u2260 Denim\n\n3. Now we need to determine if we can infer that \"the shirt was not cotton.\" To do this, let's examine the original conditional statement and compare it with our new information.\n\n4. In the original statement, there is no mention of what happens when the pants are not denim. Therefore, having pants that are not denim does not necessarily mean the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
