We are given the statement \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n2. We are also told that \"the truck was not metal.\"\n3. From these two pieces of information, we cannot definitively say whether or not the doll is plastic. \n4. That's because even if the truck isn't metal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the condition for the doll being plastic has been met. There could be other materials the truck could be made of that don't involve the doll being plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
