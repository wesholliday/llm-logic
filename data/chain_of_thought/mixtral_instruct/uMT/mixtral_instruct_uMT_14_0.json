We have the statement \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"implication\" or \"if-then\" statement.\n2. The second statement given is \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n3. If the wolf was not in the den, and the first statement tells us that if the bear were in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den, it follows that the bear cannot be in the cave.\n4. This is because the second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
