            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We are given the conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is known as a material implication, and it means that if the antecedent (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate eating salad) must also be true.\n2. However, we are also told that \"Kate did not eat salad.\" Based on our conditional statement from point 1, this would imply that Ben did not eat pasta either.\n3. This is an application of logical reasoning called modus tollens, which states: if p -> q (if p then q), and not-q (not q), then not-p (not p). In this case, p represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n4. Therefore, given the information provided, we can indeed infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
