From the second statement, we can infer that Sue must not have chosen pizza either because if she had, then according to the first statement, Bob would have chosen pasta.\n4. But since Bob didn't choose pasta, it contradicts the initial condition that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n5. Therefore, to maintain consistency and avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
