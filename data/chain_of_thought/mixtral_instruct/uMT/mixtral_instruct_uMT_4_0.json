We know that \"if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"implication\" or \"if-then\" statement.\n2. We are also told that \"the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n3. From these two pieces of information, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars, because if the alien had visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter (from point 1), but we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter (from point 2). Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the alien visited Mars\") must be false.\n4. So, to answer the question: Answer: yes",
