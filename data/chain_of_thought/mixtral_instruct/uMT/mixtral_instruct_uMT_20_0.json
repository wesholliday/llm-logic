            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We are given the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - It does not mean that if the apple is red, the banana must be yellow at the same time. It means that *if* the apple were ever observed to be red, *then* we could conclude that the banana was (or had been) yellow.\n   \n2. The second statement is \"the banana was not yellow.\" This negates the conclusion of our conditional statement above.\n\nNow let's consider the original premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" Since we know that the banana was not yellow, it follows that the apple cannot have been red. If the apple were red, then the banana would have to be yellow, but we've established that the banana is not yellow. Therefore, the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
