(This is called a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn.)\n2. We also know that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n3. From this information, we cannot definitively say whether the griffin was or was not in the forest because the truth of a conditional statement (the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn is in the forest) does not require the condition to be sufficient for its conclusion (the griffin's presence causing the unicorn's presence).\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest.",
