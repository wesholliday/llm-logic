From the second statement, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n3. According to the first statement, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n4. However, since we know from the second statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo, this means that the condition in the first statement (Joe going to the park) cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
