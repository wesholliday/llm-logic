However, we are also told that \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n3. Given the second piece of information, it directly contradicts the condition stated in the first sentence - namely, that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train.\n4. Since the condition is not met (because Erin did not take a train), we cannot infer whether or not Sam took a plane. It's possible that he did, but it's also possible that he didn't. The information provided does not allow us to determine this with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No.",
