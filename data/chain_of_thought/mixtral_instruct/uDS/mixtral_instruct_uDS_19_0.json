This is a statement of exhaustive possibilities; there are no other options.\n2. We are also told that the watch isn't on his wrist. \n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser. This follows logically from the first statement (that one of those two things must be true) and the second statement (which rules out one of the possibilities).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
