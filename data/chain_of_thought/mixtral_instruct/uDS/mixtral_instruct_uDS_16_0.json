The pen isn't on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the pen cannot be found on the desk. Since statement 1 tells us that the pen can only be either in the bag or on the desk, and now we have confirmed that it is not on the desk, it logically follows that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
