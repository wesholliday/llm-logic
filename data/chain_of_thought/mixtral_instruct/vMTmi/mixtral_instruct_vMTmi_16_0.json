            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that the pants might not have been denim. This means that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim, which can be represented as \"possibly not Q\".\n3. The conclusion states that the shirt was not cotton. This is a negation of the antecedent in the first premise, represented as \"not P\".\n4. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n5. However, even if the pants were not denim (premise 2), it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton (conclusion). There could be other materials for the pants that would still satisfy the condition in premise 1.\n6. Therefore, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion, making this argument form logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
