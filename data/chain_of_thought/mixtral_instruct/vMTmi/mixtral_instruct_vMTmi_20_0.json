This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow. This introduces uncertainty about the truth of the consequent (Q) in our conditional statement from premise 1.\n3. However, even if the banana wasn't yellow, it doesn't necessarily mean that the apple couldn't be red. The truth of the antecedent (P) in our conditional statement isn't affected by the uncertainty introduced in premise 2.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
