The second premise states that the cat might not have been outside. This introduces uncertainty about the cat's location.\n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the dog could not have been inside. It is possible that both the cat was outside and the dog was inside.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'The dog was not inside' does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
