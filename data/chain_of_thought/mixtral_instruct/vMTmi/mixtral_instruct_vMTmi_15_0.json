The second premise states that Erin might not have taken a train. This can be interpreted as saying it's possible that Erin did not take a train (symbolized as ~B).\n3. From these two premises, we cannot conclude that Sam did not take a plane (~A). Instead, the second premise only tells us about a possibility, not a certainty.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
