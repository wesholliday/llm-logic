The second premise introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence at the wedding; it does not confirm her absence.\n3. From these two premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was not at the wedding because the possibility remains open that both conditions could be true (Mary and Sue being at the wedding) or false (neither of them being there).\n4. The argument form is invalid since it does not follow logically from the given premises to reach the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
