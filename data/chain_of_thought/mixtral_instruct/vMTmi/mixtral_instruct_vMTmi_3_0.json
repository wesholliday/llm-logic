In this form, if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth of each premise.\n- Premise 1: We don't know whether it is true or false since we have no information about James or the book's genre.\n- Premise 2: This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, which implies that Q (the book being a mystery novel) is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 3: Assess the validity of the argument based on its structure and premises' truth values.\n- Since the logical form Modus Tollens is used, if both premises were true, then the conclusion would be logically valid. However, we cannot determine whether the premises are actually true or false since there is insufficient information about James or the book.\n\nAnswer: The argument has a logically valid structure (Modus Tollens), but it's impossible to say if the conclusion is necessarily true without knowing more about the truth values of the premises.",
