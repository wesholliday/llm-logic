This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis. This can be interpreted as there being a possibility that Amy did not play tennis (\u00acQ).\n3. The conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acP).\n4. In this argument form, the conclusion negates the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n5. However, just because there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff did not play basketball. The truth of the second premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n6. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
