This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake. This means it's possible that the mummy was not awake (~Q).\n3. From these two premises, we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake (~P). That would be a non sequitur fallacy because the premises do not support such a conclusion.\n4. The only valid conclusion from these premises would be that \"the mummy being asleep does not necessarily mean the vampire was also asleep\". \n\nAnswer: No, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
