This is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise states that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This can be interpreted as saying that the muffins being non-blueberry (not-Q) is possible.\n3. From these two premises, we cannot conclude that the cake was not chocolate because the truth of the first premise does not depend on the actual state of affairs regarding the muffins. The first premise only states what would be true if the cake were chocolate.\n4. Therefore, even if it's possible that the muffins are not blueberry (not-Q), this doesn't contradict the hypothesis that the cake is chocolate (P).\n\nAnswer: No.",
