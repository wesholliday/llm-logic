The second premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den. This introduces uncertainty about the wolf's location.\n3. From these two premises, the conclusion is drawn that the bear was not in the cave.\n4. However, the second premise only introduces uncertainty about the wolf's location, it does not necessarily mean that the wolf was not in the den.\n5. Therefore, even if the wolf was not in the den, it doesn't logically follow that the bear could not have been in the cave. The two statements are not logically connected.\n\nAnswer: No.",
