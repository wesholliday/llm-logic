            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then q\".\n2. The second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This can be interpreted as there being a possibility that Chris did not finish the race, or \"possibly not-q\".\n3. The conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race. This is the negation of p, or \"not-p\".\n4. To determine if this argument form is logically valid, we can use a method called proof by contradiction. We assume the opposite of what we want to prove (that Alex finished the race) and see if it leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n5. If Alex finished the race, then according to the first premise, Chris must have finished the race as well. However, this contradicts the second premise, which states that Chris might not have finished the race.\n6. Since assuming that Alex finished the race leads to a contradiction with the premises, we can conclude by proof by contradiction that Alex did not finish the race.\n7. Therefore, the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
