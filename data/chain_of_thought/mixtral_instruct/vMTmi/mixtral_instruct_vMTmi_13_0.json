            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement where the car's color being red implies the truck's color being blue.\n2. The second premise states that the truck might not have been blue. This introduces uncertainty about the truck's color.\n3. However, the conclusion states that the car was not red. This is a categorical statement with no uncertainty.\n4. To evaluate logical validity, we need to determine if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n5. In this case, even if the truck might not have been blue, it doesn't necessarily mean that the car wasn't red. There could be other reasons for the truck not being blue.\n6. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
