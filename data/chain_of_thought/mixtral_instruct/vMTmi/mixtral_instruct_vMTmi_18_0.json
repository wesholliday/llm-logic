            "content": "Step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement where the condition (the doll being plastic) leads to a consequence (the truck being metal).\n2. The second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This introduces uncertainty about the truck's material.\n3. However, this uncertainty does not necessarily mean that the doll cannot be plastic. It could still be possible that the doll is plastic and the truck is made of another material besides metal.\n4. The conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. But based on the premises provided, there is no clear reason to draw this conclusion.\n5. Therefore, the argument's form is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
