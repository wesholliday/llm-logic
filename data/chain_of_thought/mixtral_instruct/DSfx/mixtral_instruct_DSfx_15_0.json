This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n2. We are also given that 'The dreb is not spened'. \n\nNow let's analyze whether we can infer 'The dreb is vroombed':\n1. Since 'The dreb is not spened', and we know from the first statement that at least one of 'spended' or 'vroombed' must be true, it follows that 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n2. This is because if 'The dreb is not spened', then the only remaining option according to the first statement is 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
