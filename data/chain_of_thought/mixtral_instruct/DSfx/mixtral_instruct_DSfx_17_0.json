We have two premises:\n   a) Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled (Premise 1).\n   b) The flob is not movated (Premise 2).\n\n2. From Premise 1, we know that there are only two possible states for the flob: either it is movated or skizzled.\n3. Premise 2 tells us that the flob is not in the movated state.\n4. Given that there are no other possibilities mentioned for the flob's state and that we have been told it is not in the movated state, we can infer by the process of elimination that the flob must be in the skizzled state.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
