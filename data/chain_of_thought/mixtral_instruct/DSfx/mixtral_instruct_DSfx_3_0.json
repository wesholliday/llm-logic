            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply principles of logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two statements: A) \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\" and B) \"The splat is not quanked\".\n2. Our goal is to determine if we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n3. To do this, let's analyze each statement separately:\n   A) This statement presents two possibilities for the splat - it is either quanked or morphed.\n   B) This statement negates the first possibility presented in statement A, stating that the splat is not quanked.\n4. Given that the splat is not quanked (statement B), we can deduce that only one possibility remains from statement A: the splat is morphed.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
