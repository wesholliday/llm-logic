We have two statements: (A) \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked\" and (B) \"The shank is not nugged\".\n2. Statement A presents us with two possible conditions for the shank - either it's nugged or plooked, but not both at the same time.\n3. Statement B tells us that the first condition (nugged) does not apply to the shank.\n4. Since there are no other possibilities mentioned in statement A, and we now know that the first possibility (nugged) doesn't apply, it follows logically that the second possibility (plooked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
