We have two initial possibilities for the state of the sneg: it is either sprouted or crampled (let's call this statement A).\n2. Then we are told that the sneg is not sprouted (let's call this statement B).\n3. To determine if we can infer that the sneg is crampled, we need to examine whether statement B contradicts or supports statement A.\n4. Since statement A only states that the sneg is either sprouted or crampled, and statement B tells us that it is not sprouted, this does not directly tell us that the sneg is crampled. However, it does mean that one of the two possibilities in statement A has been ruled out (the possibility of the sneg being sprouted).\n5. Based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the sneg is crampled; we only know that it is not sprouted.\n\nAnswer: No.",
