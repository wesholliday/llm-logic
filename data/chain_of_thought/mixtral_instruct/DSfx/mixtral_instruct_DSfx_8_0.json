We have two statements: \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\" and \"The sprocket is not daggled\".\n2. The first statement presents us with a disjunction, which means that at least one of its parts must be true. In this case, the statement says that either the sprocket is daggled (A) or it is cranked (B).\n3. The second statement tells us that the sprocket is not daggled (not A).\n4. Since the first statement presents a disjunction and we know that the sprocket is not daggled, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement must be true.\n5. Therefore, since the sprocket is not daggled, it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
