We have two statements: (A) \"Either the wug is garbled or it is sproinged\" and (B) \"The wug is not garbled\".\n2. Our goal is to determine if we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged\" based on these two statements.\n3. Statement A presents us with a disjunction, which means one of its parts must be true. The two possibilities are: the wug is garbled or the wug is sproinged.\n4. Statement B tells us that the first possibility in statement A (the wug being garbled) is false.\n5. Since we know that at least one part of statement A must be true, and the first part has been proven false, it follows that the second part (the wug being sproinged) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
