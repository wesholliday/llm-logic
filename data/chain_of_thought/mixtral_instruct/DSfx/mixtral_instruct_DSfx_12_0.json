We have the statement \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"The smip is not lupped.\" \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped. Here's why:\n\n- If the smip is not lupped (which it isn't, according to the second statement), then by the first statement, it must be shripped. This is a basic principle of logical disjunction - if one statement in a disjunction is false, the other statement must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
