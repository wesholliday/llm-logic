Given statement: \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\" This statement presents two possible options for the state of the fleeg - either it is surned or bluttered. It can be represented as P v Q, where P represents 'the fleeg is surned' and Q represents 'the fleeg is bluttered'.\n2. Given statement: \"The fleeg is not surned.\" This statement negates the first option presented in the initial statement. It can be represented as \u00acP.\n3. Now, we want to determine if we can infer that 'the fleeg is bluttered' (Q) based on the given statements.\n4. Since the second statement explicitly tells us that 'the fleeg is not surned' (\u00acP), and the first statement presents only two possible options for the state of the fleeg, it follows logically that if the fleeg is not in the first state (surned), then it must be in the second state (bluttered).\n5. Therefore, we can indeed infer that 'the fleeg is bluttered' (Q) based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
