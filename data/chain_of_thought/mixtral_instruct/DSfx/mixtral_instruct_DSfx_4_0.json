We have two premises:\n   a) Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled (Premise 1).\n   b) The fribble is not crinked (Premise 2).\n\n2. Now, let's analyze Premise 1. It states that at least one of two possibilities is true: the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled. This is an example of a disjunction, which means that at least one of the connected statements must be true.\n\n3. Next, we consider Premise 2, which asserts that the fribble is not crinked. This statement negates the first possibility mentioned in Premise 1.\n\n4. Given that the first possibility (the fribble being crinkled) has been ruled out by Premise 2, and since Premise 1 states that at least one of the two possibilities must be true, it follows that the second possibility (the fribble being snurgled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
