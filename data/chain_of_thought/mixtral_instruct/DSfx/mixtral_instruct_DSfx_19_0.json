We have two initial possibilities for the smonk: it is either plagged or vreebled (but not both at the same time). This can be represented as:\n   P1: Smonk is plagged (P) or\n   P2: Smonk is vreebled (V)\n\n2. We are given that the smonk is not plagged (~P), which means we can eliminate possibility P1.\n\n3. Now, we only have one remaining possibility for the smonk: it must be vreebled (V).\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
