We have two statements: (A) \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked\" and (B) \"The whiffle is not tinked\".\n2. Our goal is to determine if we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\" based on these two statements.\n3. Statement A presents us with a disjunction, which means one of the two parts must be true: either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\n4. Statement B tells us that the first part of statement A (the whiffle being tinked) is not true.\n5. Since one of the parts in statement A must be true, and we know that the first part is not true, it follows that the second part (the whiffle being shanked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
