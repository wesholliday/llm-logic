We have the statement \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. We are also given the statement \"The glip is not tragged.\" \n\nGiven these two pieces of information, let's consider what we can infer:\n3.
