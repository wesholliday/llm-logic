This is called a conditional statement.\n2. We are also told that Lucy went to the zoo (consequence B).\n\nNow, let's think about whether we can conclude that Joe went to the park (condition A):\n\n- The given conditional statement tells us that if A is true, then B is true. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if B is true, then A must be true as well. This type of reasoning is called affirming the consequent and is a fallacy because there could be other reasons for B to be true besides A being true.\n- For example, Lucy might have gone to the zoo not because Joe went to the park but because she had her own reasons to go there.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Joe went to the park'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
