This is called a conditional statement and it can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n2. We are also given that 'the book is a mystery novel', which is the statement Q.\n3. However, just because the book is a mystery novel (Q), it doesn't necessarily mean that James wrote it (P). There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude 'the book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
