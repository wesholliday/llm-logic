            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and use logical reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is that \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is equivalent to Q in our conditional statement.\n3. We want to determine if we can conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" or P, based on these two statements.\n4. To do this, let's consider what would happen if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~P). According to the contrapositive of our conditional statement, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~Q), then Lisa would not have bought the red shirt (~P). However, we know that Mark did buy the blue shirt (Q), so this scenario does not apply.\n5. Now let's consider what happens when Lisa buys the red shirt (P). Based on our conditional statement, if Lisa buys the red shirt (P), then Mark will buy the blue shirt (Q). Since we know that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt (Q), this scenario aligns with our given information.\n6. Therefore, based on the two statements provided, we can conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
