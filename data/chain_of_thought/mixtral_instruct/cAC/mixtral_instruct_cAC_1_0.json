            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothesis or an \"if-then\" statement. Let's denote it as P -> Q, where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n\nNow we want to determine if we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding (P) based on this information. To do so, let's consider two scenarios:\n\na) If P is true, then Q must also be true according to the given conditional statement (P -> Q). Since we know that Q is indeed true, it aligns with our assumption that P is true.\n\nb) However, just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true as well. It could be possible that Sue was at the wedding for some other reason unrelated to Mary's presence. In this case, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the given information.\n\nTherefore, while it might be plausible that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot conclusively determine her presence based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
