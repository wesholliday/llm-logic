            "content": " Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n   - If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n2. We also know that \"The banana was yellow.\" This corresponds to 'B' in our conditional statement above.\n3. However, just because the condition (A) was not explicitly stated as true or false, we cannot directly infer that it is true based on the information given. \n   - The fact that \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are both true does not necessarily mean that \"A\" is true. This is a common misconception in logic known as affirming the consequent.\n4. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that 'The apple was red' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
