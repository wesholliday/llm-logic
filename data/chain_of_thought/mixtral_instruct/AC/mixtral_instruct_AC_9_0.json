            "content": " To approach this question, let's break down the given statements and apply some basic principles of logic:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is that \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is equivalent to Q in our conditional statement.\n3. Now we want to know if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt (P) based on these two statements.\n4. To make this inference, we would need to apply Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus Ponens states that from P -> Q and P, we can infer Q.\n5. However, in our case, we are given Q (Mark bought the blue shirt) but not P (Lisa bought the red shirt). Therefore, we cannot directly apply Modus Ponens to infer P.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given statements and logical reasoning.",
