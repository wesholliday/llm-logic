We have the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. \n2. The second statement given is \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer that \"The bear was in the cave,\" we need to see if the second statement provides enough information to confirm the condition stated in the first sentence.\n4. However, even though we know that \"The wolf was in the den,\" this fact alone does not necessarily mean that \"The bear was in the cave.\" The two statements are related but do not have a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nAnswer: No.",
