This is a conditional statement, often written as P -> Q.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo (Q) is a fact.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that Joe went to the park (P). To do this, let's consider what the given conditional statement means:\n\n- If P is true, then Q must be true.\n- However, if Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true. This is because there could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the rules of logic, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park (P).\n\nAnswer: No.",
