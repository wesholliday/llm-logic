            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, often called a hypothesis or an \"if-then\" statement. Let's denote it as P -> Q, where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n\nNow we want to determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding (P) based on this information. To do so, let's consider two scenarios:\n\na) If P is true, then Q must also be true according to the given conditional statement (P -> Q). Since we know that Q is indeed true in this case, there is no contradiction here.\n\nb) However, just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true as well. It could be the case that Sue attended the wedding for some other reason unrelated to Mary. So, from knowing only that Q is true, we cannot definitively conclude that P is true.\n\nTherefore, while having both pieces of information together might make it more likely that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot infer it conclusively based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
