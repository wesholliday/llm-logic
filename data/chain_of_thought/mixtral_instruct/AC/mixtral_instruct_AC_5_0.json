We have the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is also known as a material implication or a hypothetical proposition.\n2. We are also told that \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"Jeff played basketball,\" let's consider the possible scenarios:\n- If Jeff did play basketball, then according to the given conditional statement, Amy would have played tennis. Since we know that Amy did play tennis, this scenario aligns with our given information.\n- However, just because Amy played tennis does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. It could be possible that Amy played tennis for some other reason unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
