However, we are also told that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This introduces uncertainty about whether she actually went to the zoo.\n3. The key here is understanding that just because there's a possibility that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean Joe didn't go to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
