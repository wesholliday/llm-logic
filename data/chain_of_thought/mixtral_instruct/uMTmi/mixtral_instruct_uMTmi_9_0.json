            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If A, then B.\"\n2. We also know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means that there's a possibility that B did not occur.\n3. From these two statements, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because the given information does not exclude the possibility of Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark not buying the blue shirt. The statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" introduces this possibility.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, it is possible for Lisa to have bought the red shirt, but we cannot definitively say that she did or did not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
