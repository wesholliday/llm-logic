However, it doesn't necessarily mean that Chris' finish determines Alex's.\n2. Chris might not have finished the race. This statement alone does not give us enough information about Alex's finish.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race because there is still a possibility that he did finish. The first statement only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have as well; it doesn't tell us that Chris' result determines Alex's.\n\nAnswer: No.",
