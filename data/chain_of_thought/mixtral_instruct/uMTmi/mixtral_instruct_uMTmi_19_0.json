We know that \"if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement where the hypothesis is \"Tom watched football\" and the conclusion is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. However, we also know that \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This introduces uncertainty about whether the conclusion of our conditional statement is true.\n3. If Jen did not watch basketball, then according to the first statement, Tom should not have watched football either. But this contradicts the information given in the second statement.\n4. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if Tom watched football or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
