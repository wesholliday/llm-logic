Here's why:\n\n1. If the bear were indeed in the cave, then it would follow that the wolf must be in the den (from our first statement). However, since there is uncertainty about the wolf's location, we cannot say for certain whether this condition holds true or not.\n2. The fact that there is uncertainty regarding the wolf's whereabouts does not necessarily mean that the bear could not have been in the cave. It simply means that we lack sufficient information to make a definitive conclusion about the bear's location based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the provided information.",
