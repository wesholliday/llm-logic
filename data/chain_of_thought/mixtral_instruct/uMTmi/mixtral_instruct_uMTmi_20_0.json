            "content": " Let's break this down:\n\n1. We know that \"if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, specifically an example of modus ponens in logic.\n2. However, we are also told that \"the banana might not have been yellow.\" This introduces uncertainty about the color of the banana.\n3. Since there's a possibility that the banana was not yellow, it doesn't necessarily mean that the apple wasn't red. It could still be the case that the apple is red and the banana is some other color.\n4. But, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple is red based on the given information because there's a possibility that the banana isn't yellow, which would violate the initial conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the apple was not red.",
