However, we don't have enough information to confirm whether the shirt is cotton or not.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n- Since there is no contradiction and insufficient evidence to conclude otherwise, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
