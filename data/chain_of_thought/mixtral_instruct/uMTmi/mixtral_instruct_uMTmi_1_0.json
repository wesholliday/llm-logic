From \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue's presence is guaranteed. However, it does not guarantee that Mary's presence is required for Sue to be there.\n2. The statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain or unknown.\n3. Based on these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude whether Mary was or wasn't at the wedding because the information provided does not establish a direct relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's absence.\n\nAnswer: No.",
