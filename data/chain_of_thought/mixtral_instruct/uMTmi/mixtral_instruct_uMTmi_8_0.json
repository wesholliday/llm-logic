If the vampire is not awake (false p), then the condition does not necessarily apply, and the mummy could be either awake or asleep (true q or false q).\n\nStep 4: Since we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake based on the given information, let's consider whether it is possible for the vampire to be awake. If the mummy is indeed awake (true q), then our conditional statement would require the vampire also to be awake (true p). However, this does not exclude the possibility that the vampire was asleep (false p) when the mummy was awake (true q).\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information.",
