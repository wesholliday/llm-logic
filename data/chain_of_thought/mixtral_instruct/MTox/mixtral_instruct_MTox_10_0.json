To infer whether \"the wug was not sproinged,\" we need to determine if there's a connection between being \"sproinged\" and being \"garbled.\"\n4. The given information tells us that if the wug was sproinged, it would be garbled. However, since we know that the wug was not garbled, this implies that it wasn't sproinged either.\n5. This is because if the wug had been sproinged, then according to the second statement, it would have been garbled, which contradicts the first statement.\n6. Therefore, since both statements cannot be false at the same time, the wug not being garbled implies that it wasn't sproinged either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
