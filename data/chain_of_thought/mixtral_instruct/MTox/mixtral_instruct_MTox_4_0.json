Our second piece of information is the conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer \"the fribble was not snurgled,\" let's consider what would happen if the fribble were indeed snurgled. According to our second piece of information, if the fribble were snurgled, it would crink.\n4. However, we know from our first piece of information that the fribble did not crink. Therefore, it cannot be true that the fribble was snurgled because that would contradict our first piece of information.\n5. Since we have no other possible explanations for why the fribble did not crink, we can confidently infer that \"the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
