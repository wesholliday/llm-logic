We know that \"The flugel was not zargled.\" This means that the flugel did not undergo some hypothetical process called \"zargling.\"\n2. We are also given the conditional statement, \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" In other words, if the flugel underwent a different hypothetical process called \"blimming,\" it would result in the flugel being \"zargled.\"\n3. Since we know that the flugel was not zargled, then the condition for blimming cannot be met. In other words, if the flugel did undergo blimming, it would have been zargled, but since it wasn't zargled, it must not have been blimmed either.\n4. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
