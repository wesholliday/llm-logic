We also know that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have moved (flob motivates).\n3. Now we need to determine whether the flob was skizzled or not based on these two statements.\n4. Since the flob didn't move, it contradicts the second statement, which says that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have moved.\n5. Therefore, since the flob did not move and its movement is a direct result of being skizzled (as per our given information), we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
