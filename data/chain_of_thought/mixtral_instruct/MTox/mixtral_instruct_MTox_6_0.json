            "content": " Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that \"the grommet did not plop the frink.\" This means that the action of plopping the frink by the grommet did not occur.\n2. We are also given the conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be rewritten in logical notation as: sploff(grommet) -> plop(grommet, frink).\n3. Our goal is to determine if we can infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' or written as \u00acsploff(grommet).\n4. To do this, let's assume the opposite, that the grommet was sploffed (sploff(grommet)).\n5. According to our conditional statement, if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink (plop(grommet, frink)).\n6. However, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink (\u00acplop(grommet, frink)). This contradicts our assumption in step 4.\n7. Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed (\u00acsploff(grommet)).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
