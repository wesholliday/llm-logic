We also know that \"if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" (conditional statement B).\n3. Our goal is to determine if we can infer \"the smip was not shripped\" (conclusion C).\n4. To do this, let's consider what could make statement A true based on statement B.\n5. If statement B is true, then the only way for statement A to be true is if the smip was not shripped because if it were, it would have lupped the zoint according to statement B.\n6. Therefore, given statements A and B, we can indeed infer conclusion C: \"the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
