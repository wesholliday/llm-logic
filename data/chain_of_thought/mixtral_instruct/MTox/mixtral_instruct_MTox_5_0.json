            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and use logical reasoning:\n1. We know that \"The zinger was not smoogled.\" (Statement A)\n2. We also know that \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" (Statement B)\n3. To determine if we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled,\" let's first assume the opposite: The zinger is fraggled.\n4. If the zinger is fraggled, then according to Statement B, it should be smoogled. However, Statement A tells us that the zinger is not smoogled.\n5. This contradiction means that our assumption (that the zinger is fraggled) must be incorrect.\n6. Therefore, since we have shown that the zinger cannot be both fraggled and not smoogled, it follows logically that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it also cannot be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
