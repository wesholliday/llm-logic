This means that, regardless of whether the sneg was crumpled or not, it did not sprout the frink.\n2. We are also given the conditional statement \"If the sneg was crumpled, then the sneg sprouted the frink\". In other words, if the sneg is crumpled, *then* it will sprout the frink.\n3. However, since we know that the sneg did not sprout the frink (from step 1), this means that the condition for the sneg to be crumpled cannot be met. In other words, if the sneg did not sprout the frink, then it must not have been crumpled.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crumpled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
