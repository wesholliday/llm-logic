We also know that \"if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. To infer whether \"the sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to determine if there is a connection between the sprocket being cranked and it being daggled.\n4. From the given information, we can see that if the sprocket were cranked, it would be daggled. However, since we know that the sprocket was not daggled, this implies that it was also not cranked.\n5. This is because, according to the second statement, if the sprocket had been cranked, it would have been daggled, but since it wasn't daggled, it couldn't have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
