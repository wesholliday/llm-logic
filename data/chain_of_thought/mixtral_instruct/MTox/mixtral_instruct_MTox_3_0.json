            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given information and apply logical reasoning:\n1. \"The splat did not quank\" tells us that the event of a splat not producing a quank sound has occurred.\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the 'if' part) is \"the splat was morphed,\" and the consequent (the 'then' part) is \"the splat quanked.\"\n3. To determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from this information, let's use logical reasoning called Modus Tollens:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - Not Q\n   - Therefore, not P\n4. In our given statements, P represents \"the splat was morphed,\" and Q represents \"the splat quanked.\"\n5. Applying Modus Tollens, we have:\n   - If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\n   - The splat did not quank\n   - Therefore, the splat was not morphed\n\nAnswer: Yes",
