This means that whatever action or event associated with 'vroombing' the dreb did not occur, because if it had, then the dreb would have been spent.\n2. The second statement is a conditional one: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". This means that the only way for the dreb to be 'vroombed' is for it to be spent afterward.\n3. Given that the dreb was not spent (from step 1), we can conclude that it was not 'vroombed', because if it had been, then it would have been spent as per the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
