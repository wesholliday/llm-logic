From these two statements, we want to determine if we can infer 'The flug was not blummed'.\n4. To do this, let's consider the second statement as a conditional statement: P -> Q, where P is 'The flug was blummed' and Q is 'The flug was zimmed'.\n5. Now, we know that ~Q (not Q) is true from the first statement.\n6. To determine if ~P (not P) is true, we can use Modus Tollens, which states: ~Q -> ~P\n7. Since ~Q is true, and Modus Tollens tells us that ~Q -> ~P, it follows that ~P must also be true.\n8. Therefore, 'The flug was not blummed' can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
