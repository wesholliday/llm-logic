We also know that \"if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" (statement B).\n3. To determine if we can infer \"the wug was not flooped,\" let's consider the possible scenarios when a wug is flooped or not flooped and how it relates to bimming the zoint:\n   - If the wug is not flooped, then it won't bim the zoint (as per our understanding of these words). This aligns with statement A.\n   - If the wug is flooped, then it will bim the zoint (according to statement B). However, this contradicts statement A since we know that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n4. Since the only way for both statements A and B to be true is if the wug is not flooped, we can indeed infer \"the wug was not flooped\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
