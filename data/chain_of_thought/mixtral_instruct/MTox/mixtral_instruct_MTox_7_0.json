From these two statements, can we infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked'?\n\nTo answer this question, let's consider what it means for a whiffle to be shanked. According to the given conditional statement, if the whiffle is shanked, then it tinks. So, if the whiffle did not tink, as we know from the first statement, then it must not have been shanked.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked.' This inference follows logically from the given statements.",
