To determine if \"the twonk was not plinked,\" we need to see if there is a contradiction in assuming it was plinked but not varnished.\n4. However, based on the second statement, if the twonk were plinked, then it would have been varnished. But this contradicts the first statement that \"the twonk was not varnished.\"\n5. Therefore, since assuming that the twonk was plinked leads to a contradiction, we can infer that \"the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
