Weight loss is primarily determined by a calorie deficit, meaning you burn more calories than you consume. Exercise burns calories, but junk food is typically high in calories and low in nutritional value.  \n\nTherefore, the calories consumed from junk food could easily negate the calories burned during exercise, preventing weight loss.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
