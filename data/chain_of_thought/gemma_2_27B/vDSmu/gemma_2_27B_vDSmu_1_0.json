A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nSince one of the possibilities has been ruled out, the only remaining possibility must be true. Therefore, the conclusion \"Fido is inside\" logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
