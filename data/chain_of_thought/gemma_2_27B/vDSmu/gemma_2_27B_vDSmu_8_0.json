A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (the remote can't be in both places at once), eliminating one possibility logically leads to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
