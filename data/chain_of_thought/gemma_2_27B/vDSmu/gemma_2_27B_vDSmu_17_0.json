A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (the scarf can't be in both places at once), eliminating one possibility logically leads to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
