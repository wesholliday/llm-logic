A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (the cookies can't be both in the jar and hidden in the pantry), eliminating one possibility logically leads to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
