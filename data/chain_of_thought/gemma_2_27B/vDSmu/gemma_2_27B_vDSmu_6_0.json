A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Presents the disjunction: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n* **Premise 2:** Eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\nSince we've ruled out the phone ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
