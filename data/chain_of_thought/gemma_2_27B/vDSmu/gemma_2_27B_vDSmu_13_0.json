A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Presents the disjunction: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n* **Premise 2:** Eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nSince the two premises cover all possibilities, and one possibility is eliminated, the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
