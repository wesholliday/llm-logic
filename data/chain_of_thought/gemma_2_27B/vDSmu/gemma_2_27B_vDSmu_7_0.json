A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (the umbrella can't be in both places at once), eliminating one possibility logically leads to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
