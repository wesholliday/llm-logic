Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Joe went to the park.\n* Q: Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nThe argument states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. It also states that Lucy did *not* go to the zoo. Therefore, based on the structure of modus tollens, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
