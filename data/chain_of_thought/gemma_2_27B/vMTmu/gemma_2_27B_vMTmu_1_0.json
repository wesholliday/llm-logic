Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\n* **P:** Mary was at the wedding.\n* **Q:** Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (If P, then Q).\n* It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (Not Q).\n* Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
