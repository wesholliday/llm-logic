Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Ben ate pasta.\n* Q: Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nThe argument states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. It also states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. Therefore, following the logic of modus tollens, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
