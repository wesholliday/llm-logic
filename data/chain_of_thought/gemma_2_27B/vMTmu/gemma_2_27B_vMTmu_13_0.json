Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The car was red.\n* Q: The truck must have been blue.\n\nThe argument states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. It also states that the truck was not blue. Therefore, based on the structure of modus tollens, the conclusion that the car was not red is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
