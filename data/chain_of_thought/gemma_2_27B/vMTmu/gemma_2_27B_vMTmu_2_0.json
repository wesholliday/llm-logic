Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\n* **P:** The griffin was in the forest.\n* **Q:** The unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n* If the griffin was in the forest (P), then the unicorn must have been in the forest (Q).\n* It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest (Not Q).\n* Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
