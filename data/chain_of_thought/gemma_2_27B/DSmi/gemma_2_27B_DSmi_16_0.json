It means one of these options *must* be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The pen might not be on my desk\" This statement tells us there's a possibility the pen is *not* on the desk.\n\nIf the pen is not on the desk (as Statement 2 suggests), and only one of the options from Statement 1 can be true, then the pen *must* be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
