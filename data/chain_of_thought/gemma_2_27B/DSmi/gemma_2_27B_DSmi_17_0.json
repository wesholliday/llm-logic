This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack. This tells us the second possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the scarf can't be in both places at once, if it's not on the coat rack (as Premise 2 suggests), then the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
