This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This means the second possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince Premise 1 states the keys *must* be in one of those two locations, and Premise 2 makes the second location uncertain, the only remaining possibility is the first location.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
