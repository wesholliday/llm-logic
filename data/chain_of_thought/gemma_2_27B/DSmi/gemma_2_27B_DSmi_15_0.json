This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The shoes might not be lined up by the door. This tells us the second possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the shoes can't be lined up by the door (according to Premise 2), and Premise 1 states they must be in one of those two locations, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
