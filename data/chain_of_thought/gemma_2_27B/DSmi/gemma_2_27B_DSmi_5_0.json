It means one of these options *must* be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" This statement introduces doubt about the second option from the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement says the cookies *must* be in one of those two locations, and the second statement makes the pantry location uncertain, the only remaining possibility is the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
