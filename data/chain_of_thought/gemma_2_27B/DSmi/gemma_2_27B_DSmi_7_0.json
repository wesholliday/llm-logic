This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet. This means the second possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince Premise 2 makes the second possibility of Premise 1 uncertain, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
