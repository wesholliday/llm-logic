The second statement tells us that the cat might *not* be playing in the bedroom. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement. Since the cat can't be in two places at once, if it's not playing in the bedroom, the only remaining option is that it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
