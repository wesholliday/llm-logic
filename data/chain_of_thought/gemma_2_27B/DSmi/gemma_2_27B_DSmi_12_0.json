This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This means the second possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince Premise 1 states that one of the possibilities *must* be true, and Premise 2 makes the second possibility doubtful, we are left with the first possibility as the most likely conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
