This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This tells us the second possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the sunglasses can't be on her head (according to Premise 2), and Premise 1 states they must be one or the other, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
