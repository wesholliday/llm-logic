This means at least one of them must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means it's possible the phone is *not* ringing in the kitchen.\n\nSince Statement 2 leaves open the possibility that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, and Statement 1 says one of the two possibilities *must* be true, we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
