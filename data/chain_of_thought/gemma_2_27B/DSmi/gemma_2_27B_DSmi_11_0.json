It means one of these options *must* be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch.\" This statement tells us that the second option from the first statement is possibly false.\n\nSince the first statement says one of the options *must* be true, and the second statement suggests the porch option is *not* true, we can infer that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
