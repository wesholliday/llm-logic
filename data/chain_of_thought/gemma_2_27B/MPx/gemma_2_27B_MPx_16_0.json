            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism. We have a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This means that the first part (the sneg being crampled) is a condition for the second part (the sneg sproting the frink) to be true. We are also given the fact that \"The sneg was crampled.\" Since the condition for sproting the frink has been met, we can logically conclude that the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
