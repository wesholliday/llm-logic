            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism. We have a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This means that whenever the sprocket is cranked, it must also be daggled. We are also given the premise \"The sprocket was cranked.\" Since the first part of the conditional statement is true (the sprocket was cranked), the second part must also be true (the sprocket was daggled).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
