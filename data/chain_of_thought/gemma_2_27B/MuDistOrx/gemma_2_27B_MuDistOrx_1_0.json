It flumps a zizz.\n\nThe word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these possibilities must be true.  \n\nThe rephrased statement, \"The zooble must be blimple or it must flump a zizz,\" conveys the same meaning. It simply rearranges the wording while maintaining the logical connection between the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
