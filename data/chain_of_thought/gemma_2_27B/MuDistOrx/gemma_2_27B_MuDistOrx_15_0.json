This means it's saying that one or both of the options are true.  \n\nThe phrasing \"must be in\" implies necessity.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The frazzle must be in flibbit or it must be in frozz\" uses the same components and logical structure as the original. It simply rewords the disjunction slightly.\n\nSince the meaning and logical structure remain the same, we can infer one from the other.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
