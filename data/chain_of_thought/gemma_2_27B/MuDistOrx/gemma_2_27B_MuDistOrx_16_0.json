It is \"wump\" by the \"plimp\".\n\nThe word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these possibilities must be true.  The rephrased statement maintains the same two possibilities and the requirement that at least one must be true.\n\nTherefore, the meaning of the original statement and the rephrased statement are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
