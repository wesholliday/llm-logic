The phrasing \"or\" indicates that these are alternative possibilities, meaning one or the other must be true.  \n\nThe rephrased statement, \"The wumble must be on the frozz or it must be in the shimble,\" conveys the same meaning. It simply restructures the sentence while maintaining the same logical relationship between the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
