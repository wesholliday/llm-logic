We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The zinger is not smoogled.** (This negates one of the options from the first premise).\n\nSince the zinger cannot be smoogled, and it must be either fraggled or smoogled, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
