We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.** (This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true).\n2. **The smonk is not plagged.** (This is a negation).\n\nSince the smonk cannot be both vreebled and plagged (due to the first premise), if it's not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
