We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed.** (This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true).\n2. **The flug is not zimmed.** (This is a negation).\n\nSince the flug cannot be both blummed and zimmed (due to the disjunction), and we know it's not zimmed, the only remaining possibility is that it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
