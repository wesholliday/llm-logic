We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.** (This presents two possibilities, an \"or\" statement)\n2. **The glip is not tragged.** (This eliminates one of the possibilities)\n\nSince the glip cannot be both slogged and tragged, and we know it's not tragged, the only remaining possibility is that it must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
