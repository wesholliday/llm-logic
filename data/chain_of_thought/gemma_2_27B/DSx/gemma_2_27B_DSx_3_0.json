We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.** This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n2. **The splat is not quanked.** This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first premise.\n\nSince the splat cannot be quanked (premise 2), the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that **the splat is morphed**.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
