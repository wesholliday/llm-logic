We have two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\n2. **Premise 2:** The smip is not lupped.\n\nWe need to determine if these premises logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n**Conclusion:** The smip is shripped.\n\nSince the first premise states the smip must be either shripped or lupped, and the second premise tells us it's not lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
