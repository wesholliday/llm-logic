We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.** (This is a disjunction, presenting two possibilities)\n2. **The fleeg is not surned.** (This is a negation of one of the possibilities)\n\nSince the fleeg cannot be both bluttered and surned (due to the disjunction), if it's not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
