We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged.** This sets up two possibilities, and tells us one of them *must* be true.\n2. **The clug is not snugged.** This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first premise.\n\nSince the clug cannot be snugged, and it must be either fleeked or snugged, the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
