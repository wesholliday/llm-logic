The blimple is in quank.\n\nThis is an example of a logical \"or\" statement, meaning that at least one of the possibilities must be true.  We don't have enough information to know which one is true, only that one of them *must* be.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The blimple must be quank\".\n\nAnswer: no \n",
