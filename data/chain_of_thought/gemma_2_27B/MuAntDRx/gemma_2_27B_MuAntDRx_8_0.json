The snizzle is grooble on frazzle for flim flim.\n2. The snizzle is shimble for flim flim.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the snizzle *must* be shimble for flim flim. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the snizzle being grooble on frazzle, we cannot definitively say it *must* be shimble.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
