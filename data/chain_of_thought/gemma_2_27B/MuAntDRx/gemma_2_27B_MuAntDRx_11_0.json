The snizzle is quazzle.\n\nThis is an example of a logical \"or\" statement, meaning that at least one of the options must be true.  We don't have enough information to know which one is true, only that one of them *must* be.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The snizzle must be quazzle\".\n\nAnswer: no \n",
