The original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" sets up a condition (Joe going to the park) and a consequence (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\nJust because the consequence is true (Lucy went to the zoo) doesn't automatically mean the condition is also true. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* The statement only tells us what happens *if* Joe goes to the park. It doesn't say that Joe *must* go to the park for Lucy to go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
