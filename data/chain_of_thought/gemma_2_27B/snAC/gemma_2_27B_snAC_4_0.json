We're dealing with a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q** (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter)\n\nWe know:\n\n* **Q is true** (The robot visited Jupiter)\n\nThis structure doesn't automatically mean P (The alien visited Mars) is true.  Think of it this way:\n\n* The statement only tells us what happens *if* the alien visits Mars. It doesn't say the alien *must* visit Mars for the robot to visit Jupiter. There could be other reasons why the robot went to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
