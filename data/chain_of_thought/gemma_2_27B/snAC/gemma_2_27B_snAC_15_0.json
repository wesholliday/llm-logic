The conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be represented as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q\n\nWhere:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane\n* Q: Erin took a train\n\nWe are given that Q is true (Erin took a train). However, this doesn't automatically mean that P (Sam took a plane) is also true.\n\nThink of it this way: the conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* Sam took a plane. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sam *didn't* take a plane. Erin could have taken the train for a completely different reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
