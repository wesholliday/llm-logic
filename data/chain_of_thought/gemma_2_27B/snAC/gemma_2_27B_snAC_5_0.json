It doesn't say that Jeff *did* play basketball, only that *if* he did, then Amy would play tennis.\n\nWe know that Amy played tennis. However, this doesn't automatically mean Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* The statement is true even if Jeff didn't play basketball. Maybe Amy plays tennis for other reasons unrelated to Jeff.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
