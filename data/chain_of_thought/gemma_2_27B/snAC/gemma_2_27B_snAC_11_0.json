The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". We know Q is true (the muffins were blueberry). However, in a conditional statement, even if the consequent (Q) is true, it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (P) is also true. \n\nThink of it this way: the statement only tells us what happens *if* the cake was chocolate. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake wasn't chocolate. There could be other reasons why the muffins are blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
