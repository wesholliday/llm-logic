The conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Jen watched basketball. It only tells us what happens if Tom watched football.  \n\nSince Jen watching basketball could be true for reasons unrelated to Tom watching football, we can't conclude that Tom must have watched football.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
