The conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Bob chose pasta. It only tells us what happens if Sue chose pizza.  \n\nSince Bob chose pasta, it could be because Sue chose pizza, or it could be because of some other reason entirely. We don't have enough information to conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
