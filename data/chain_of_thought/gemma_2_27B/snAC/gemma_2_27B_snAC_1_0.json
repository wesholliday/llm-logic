We're given a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This doesn't mean Sue *only* attends weddings if Mary does. It just means that if Mary is there, Sue is also there.\n\nWe're also told \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true.  \n\nSince the first statement only tells us about Sue's presence *given* Mary's presence, we can't definitively say Mary was there. It's possible Sue attended for another reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
