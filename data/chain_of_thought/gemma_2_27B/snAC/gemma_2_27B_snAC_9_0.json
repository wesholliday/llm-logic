The original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be represented as:\n\n* P: Lisa bought the red shirt\n* Q: Mark bought the blue shirt\n* The statement is then P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n\nWe are given that Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).  However, this doesn't automatically mean that P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is also true.\n\nThink of it this way: the original statement only tells us what happens *if* Lisa buys the red shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if she *doesn't* buy the red shirt. Mark could have bought the blue shirt for a completely different reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
