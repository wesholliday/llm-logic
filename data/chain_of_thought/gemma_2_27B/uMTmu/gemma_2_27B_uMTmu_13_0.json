It means that the redness of the car *implies* the blueness of the truck.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This contradicts the implication from the first statement.\n\nSince the second statement negates the necessary consequence of the first statement, the initial condition (the car being red) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
