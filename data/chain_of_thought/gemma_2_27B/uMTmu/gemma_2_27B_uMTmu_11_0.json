It means that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) *must* also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This tells us the second part of the conditional statement is false.\n\nSince the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part (the cake being chocolate) *must* also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
