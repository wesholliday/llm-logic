It means that if the first part (shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (pants being denim) *must* also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This directly contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nSince the second statement negates the necessary outcome of the first statement, the initial condition (the shirt being cotton) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
