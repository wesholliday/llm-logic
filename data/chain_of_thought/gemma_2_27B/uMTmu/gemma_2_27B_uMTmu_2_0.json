It means that the presence of the griffin *guarantees* the presence of the unicorn.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means the unicorn's presence in the forest is not guaranteed.\n\nSince the unicorn's presence is not guaranteed, and the griffin's presence *requires* the unicorn's presence, we can conclude that the griffin cannot have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
