If Alex finishing the race *always* leads to Chris finishing the race, then it *must* be the case that Chris finished the race.\n\nSince the second premise denies this, the first premise must be false.  If the first premise is false, then Alex finishing the race doesn't necessarily mean Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
