It means that James writing the book is a *sufficient* condition for the book being a mystery novel.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This means there are other possibilities for the genre of the book.\n\nSince the book doesn't *have* to be a mystery novel, and James writing it would *guarantee* it's a mystery novel, we can conclude that James couldn't have written it.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
