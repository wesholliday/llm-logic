It doesn't say that Bob *did* choose pasta, only that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob *would have* chosen pasta.\n\n2. **It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.** This means there's a possibility Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\nSince the first statement is conditional, and the second statement tells us Bob didn't *necessarily* choose pasta, we can conclude that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
