This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the vampire being awake) is true, then the second part (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means the mummy might have been awake, but it wasn't necessarily the case.\n\nSince the mummy doesn't *have* to be awake, the condition in Statement 1 might not be met.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
