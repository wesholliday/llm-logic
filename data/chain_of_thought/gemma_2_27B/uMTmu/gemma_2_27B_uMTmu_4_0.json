This sets up a conditional relationship: the robot visiting Jupiter is dependent on the alien visiting Mars.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This directly contradicts the outcome implied by Statement 1.\n\nSince the second statement negates the consequence of the first statement, the condition in the first statement must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
