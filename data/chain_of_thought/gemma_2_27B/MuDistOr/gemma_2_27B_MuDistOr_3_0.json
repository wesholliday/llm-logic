The phrasing \"or\" indicates that one or the other, or possibly both, could be true.  \n\nThe rephrased sentence, \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack,\" expresses the same two possibilities in a slightly different way. It's simply a stylistic variation, not a change in meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
