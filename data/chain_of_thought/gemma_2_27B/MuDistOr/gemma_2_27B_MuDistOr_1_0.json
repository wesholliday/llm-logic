The phrasing \"or\" indicates that these are alternative locations, meaning the envelope could be in one place or the other, but not necessarily both.  \n\nThe rephrased statement, \"The envelope must have been upstairs or it must have been under a bed,\" conveys the same meaning. It simply restructures the sentence without changing the logical relationship between the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
