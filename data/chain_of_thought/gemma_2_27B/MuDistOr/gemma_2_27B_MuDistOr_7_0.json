The phrasing \"must have been\" indicates a strong inference based on the lack of arrival.  \n\nThe rephrased sentence breaks down these possibilities into two separate statements, each using \"must have been\" to express the same level of inference. Since the original sentence already encompasses both possibilities, the rephrased sentence is a logically equivalent way of expressing the same information.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
