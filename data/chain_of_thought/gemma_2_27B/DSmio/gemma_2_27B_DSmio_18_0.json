This means it's possible the notebook is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the notebook might *not* be on the nightstand, the second premise forces us to conclude that the notebook *must* be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
