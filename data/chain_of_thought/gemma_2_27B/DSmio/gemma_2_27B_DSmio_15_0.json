This means it's possible they are not by the door.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door. This sets up two exclusive possibilities.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the shoes *might not* be by the door, and the second premise says they *must* be either in the closet or by the door, the only remaining possibility is that they are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
