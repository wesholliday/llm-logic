This means it's possible the newspaper is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the newspaper might *not* be on the porch, and Premise 2 says it must be either on the porch or in the driveway, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
