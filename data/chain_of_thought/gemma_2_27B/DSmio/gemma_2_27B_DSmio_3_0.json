This means it's possible they are not in the cabinet.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. This sets up two possibilities, and it states that one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the keys might *not* be in the cabinet, and Premise 2 says one of the two options *must* be true, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
