It doesn't rule out the possibility that it *is* on the floor.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\" This statement gives us two exclusive options: the piece is in the box, or it's on the floor.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the piece *might not* be on the floor, and the second statement says it *must* be either in the box or on the floor, we can conclude that the piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
