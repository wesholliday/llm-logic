This means it's possible the scarf is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the scarf might *not* be on the coat rack, the only option left to satisfy Premise 2 is that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
