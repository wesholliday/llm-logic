This means it's possible the watch is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the watch might *not* be on his wrist, the only remaining possibility from Premise 2 is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
