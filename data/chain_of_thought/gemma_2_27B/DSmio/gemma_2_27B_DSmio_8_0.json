This means it's possible the remote is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the remote *might not* be under the couch, the second premise forces the conclusion that the remote *must* be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
