This means it's possible they are not on her head.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the sunglasses might *not* be on her head, the only way for Premise 2 to be true is if the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
