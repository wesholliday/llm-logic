This means it's possible the umbrella is *not* in the closet.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet. This sets up two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, OR it's in the closet.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the umbrella might *not* be in the closet, and Premise 2 says it must be either in the car or the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
