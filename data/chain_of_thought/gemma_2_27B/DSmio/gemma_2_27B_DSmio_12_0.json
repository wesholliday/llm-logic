This means it's possible the jacket is *not* in the closet.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. This sets up two possibilities: the jacket is on the chair, or it's in the closet.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the jacket *might not* be in the closet, and Premise 2 says it *must* be either on the chair or in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
