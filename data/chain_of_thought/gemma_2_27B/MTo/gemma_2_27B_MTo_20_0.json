If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nWe want to determine if we can logically conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nLet's analyze the second premise. It's a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n\n* P: The apple was red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow.\n\nThis statement tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if P is false.\n\nSince we know the banana was not yellow (premise 1), we know Q is false.  Because the conditional statement is true, and Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
