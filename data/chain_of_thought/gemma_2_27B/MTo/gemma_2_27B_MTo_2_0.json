It tells us that the presence of the griffin *implies* the presence of the unicorn.\n\nSince we know the unicorn was *not* in the forest (Premise 1), the condition for the second premise cannot be true.  If the griffin *were* in the forest, then the unicorn would have to be in the forest as well, which we know isn't the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the griffin must not be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
