It tells us that the mummy being awake is a *consequence* of the vampire being awake.  \n\nSince we know the mummy was *not* awake, the condition for the second statement cannot be true. If the vampire *were* awake, the mummy would have to be awake as well.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the vampire must not be awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
