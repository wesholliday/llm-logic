It states that if a certain condition is met (the car being red), then a certain consequence follows (the truck being blue).\n\nSince we know the truck is *not* blue (Premise 1), the condition in Premise 2 cannot be true.  If the car *were* red, then the truck *would* have to be blue, which contradicts what we know.\n\nTherefore, the car cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
