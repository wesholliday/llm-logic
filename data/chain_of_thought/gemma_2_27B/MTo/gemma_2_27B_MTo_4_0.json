Modus tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" is true, and we know \"Q is false,\" then we can conclude \"P is false.\"\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The alien visited Mars.\n* Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nWe know \"Q is false\" (the robot did not visit Jupiter) and \"If P, then Q\" (if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter). Therefore, we can conclude \"P is false\" (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
