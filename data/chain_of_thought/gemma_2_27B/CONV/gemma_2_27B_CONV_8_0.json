This is a classic example of why correlation does not equal causation.\n\nThe original statement tells us that the vampire being awake is a *sufficient* condition for the mummy being awake. It doesn't say anything about the mummy being awake being a *necessary* condition for the vampire being awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake.\n\nFor example, maybe a full moon wakes up the mummy, regardless of whether the vampire is awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
