But it doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, just because the wolf being in the den *could* be caused by the bear being in the case, it doesn't mean that the wolf being in the den *always* means the bear is in the case. There could be other reasons for the wolf to be in the den.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
