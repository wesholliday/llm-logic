Just because something was nugged doesn't mean it was definitely plooked. There could be other reasons why the shank was nugged.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).**\n\nThis doesn't mean that if the ground is wet (Q), it must be raining (P). The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
