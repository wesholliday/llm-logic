The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* **If P, then Q** (If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged)\n\nWe might be tempted to think that the opposite is also true:\n\n* **If not Q, then not P** (If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged)\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons why a glip might not be tragged besides it not being slogged.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
