The scientist *might* be conducting an experiment.\n\nThese statements don't guarantee either is happening, only that it's a possibility.\n\nWhile it's *possible* the scientist is conducting an experiment in the lab, it's also possible they are in the lab for another reason, or conducting the experiment elsewhere. We don't have enough information to definitively say they are conducting an experiment in the lab.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
