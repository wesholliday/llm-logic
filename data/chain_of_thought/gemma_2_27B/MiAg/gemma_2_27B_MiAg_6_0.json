The movie might be sold out.\n\nThese possibilities are not necessarily connected. The movie could be playing but not sold out, sold out but not playing, or both playing and sold out.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the movie is both playing and sold out at the cinema.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
