We are given two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n2. **Premise 2:** The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nThese premises set up a situation where we have two possibilities, and we know one of them is false.  Since the scarf can't be in both places at once, if it's not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
