This means these are the only two possibilities for Fido's location.\n* **Premise 2:** Fido might not be in the garden. This means it's possible Fido is not in the garden.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Since Fido must be either inside or in the garden, and it's possible he's not in the garden, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
