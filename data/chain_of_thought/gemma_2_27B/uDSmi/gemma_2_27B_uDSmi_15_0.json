The shoes are lined up by the door.\n\nWe are also told that the shoes \"might not\" be lined up by the door. This means the second possibility is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the first possibility is always true (either the shoes are in the closet or they are by the door), and the second possibility might be false, we can conclude that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
