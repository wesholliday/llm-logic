It doesn't tell us which one is true, only that one of them has to be.\n* **\"The wug might not be garpled\"**: This means it's possible the wug is not garpled.\n\nSince the first statement says one of the options *must* be true, and the second statement says the wug *might not* be garpled, the only remaining possibility is that the wug *must* be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
