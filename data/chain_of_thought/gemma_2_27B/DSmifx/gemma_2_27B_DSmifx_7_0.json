It doesn't say they can't both be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The whiffle might not be tinked.\" This statement tells us there's a possibility the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nSince the first statement says the whiffle must be *either* tinked *or* shanked, and the second statement says it *might not* be tinked, the only remaining possibility to satisfy the first statement is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
