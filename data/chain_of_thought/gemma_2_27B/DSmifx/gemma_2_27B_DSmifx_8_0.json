It's an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of these must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\" This means there's a possibility the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nSince the first statement says the sprocket must be either daggled or cranked, and the second statement says it might not be daggled, the only remaining possibility to satisfy the first statement is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
