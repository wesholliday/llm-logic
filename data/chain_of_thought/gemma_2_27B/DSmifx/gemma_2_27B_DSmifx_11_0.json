It doesn't tell us which one is actually true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The flug might not be zimmed\" This statement introduces doubt about the first possibility (the flug being zimmed).\n\nSince the first statement says the flug *must* be either zimmed or blummed, and the second statement suggests it *might not* be zimmed, the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
