This satisfies Statement 2, and doesn't contradict Statement 1.\n* **Scenario 2:** The twonk is not varnished. This would mean it must be plinked to satisfy Statement 2. But this contradicts Statement 1.\n\nSince Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, Scenario 1 must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
