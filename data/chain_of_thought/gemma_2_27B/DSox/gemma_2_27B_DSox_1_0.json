This rule states that if we know one part of a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) is false, then the other part must be true.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the flugel is *not* zargled, and Statement 2 says it must be either blimmed *or* zargled, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
