The conditional statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". The consequent, \"the wolf was in the den\", is given as true.  \n\nHowever, we cannot logically conclude that the antecedent, \"the bear was in the cave\", is also true.  \n\nThink of it this way: the original statement only tells us what happens if the bear is in the cave. It doesn't say that the wolf being in the den *only* happens if the bear is in the cave. There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
