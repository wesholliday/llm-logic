            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\n* The second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" tells us that Q is true.\n\n*  In a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is true, we cannot necessarily conclude that the antecedent (P) is also true. There might be other reasons why Q is true.\n\n* For example, maybe Sue always attends weddings, regardless of whether Mary does.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
