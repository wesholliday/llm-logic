We have the following:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n* **Premise 2:** The clug snugged.\n\nThis structure resembles a logical argument called \"affirming the consequent\". This type of argument is invalid. Just because the consequent (the clug snugged) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is also true. There could be other reasons why the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
