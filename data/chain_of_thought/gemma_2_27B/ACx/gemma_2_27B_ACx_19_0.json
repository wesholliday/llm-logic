We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n* **Premise 2:** The smonk plagged.\n* **Conclusion:** The smonk was vreebled.\n\nThis structure resembles the following valid argument form:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Q.\n* Therefore, P.\n\nHowever, this form is only valid if we know for sure that the only way for Q to be true is if P is also true. In our case, while the premises suggest a connection, we don't know if there are other ways for the smonk to plag besides being vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
