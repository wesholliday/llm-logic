The conditional statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\". This means that if the twonk was plinked, then varnished is a guaranteed outcome. We are also given that \"The twonk was varnished\".  \n\nSince the consequent (varnished) is true, and the conditional statement links plinking to varnishing, we can infer that the twonk must have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
