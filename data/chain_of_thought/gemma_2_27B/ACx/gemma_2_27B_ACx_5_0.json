We have a conditional statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This means that if the first part (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the second part (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true. We also know that \"The zinger was smoogled\" is true.\n\nHowever, just because the zinger was smoogled doesn't necessarily mean it was fraggled. There could be other reasons why the zinger was smoogled. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if it *was* fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
