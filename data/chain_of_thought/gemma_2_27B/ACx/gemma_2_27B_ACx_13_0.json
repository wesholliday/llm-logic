We have a conditional statement:\n\n* If P, then Q (If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged)\n\nAnd we are given:\n\n* Q (The glip was tragged)\n\nThis structure matches the form of *modus ponens*, a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus ponens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"Q\", then we can infer \"P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
