We are given:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n* **Premise 2:** The shank was nugged.\n\nThis structure resembles a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the consequent (Q) being true.  \n\nHowever, just because the shank was nugged doesn't automatically mean it was plooked. There could be other reasons why the shank was nugged.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
