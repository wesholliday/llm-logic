Modus ponens states that if we know:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n\nThen we can conclude P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The splat was morphed.\n* Q: The splat quanked.\n\nSince we know the splat quanked (Q is true), and we know that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank (If P, then Q is true), we can conclude that the splat was morphed (P is true).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
