            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement.\n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This means that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n\n* **Given Information:** \"The sprocket was daggled.\" This tells us the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n* **Inference:**  We can't definitively infer that \"The sprocket was cranked.\" While the daggling could be a result of cranking, there might be other reasons why the sprocket was daggled. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if it was cranked, not the only way it could be daggled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
