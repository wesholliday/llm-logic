            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using conditional statements. \n\n* **Premise 1:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\")\n* **Premise 2:** Erin did not take a train. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to draw a conclusion. Modus tollens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane\n* Q: Erin took a train\n\nSince we know Q is false (Erin did not take a train), we can conclude that P must also be false (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
