            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as:\n\n   P \u2192 Q \n   (Where P = \"The doll was plastic\" and Q = \"The truck was metal\")\n\n* **Given Information:** \"The truck was not metal.\" This is the negation of Q:  \u00acQ\n\n* **Logical Inference:**  We can use a rule called *modus tollens* to draw a conclusion. Modus tollens states: If P \u2192 Q is true, and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must also be true.\n\nIn our case, we know the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true and we are given \u00acQ. Therefore, we can conclude \u00acP, which means \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
