            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as:\n\n   P \u2192 Q \n   (Where P = Joe went to the park, and Q = Lucy went to the zoo)\n\n* **Given Information:** \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This is represented as:\n\n   \u00acQ (Not Q)\n\n* **Logical Inference:**  We can use a rule called *modus tollens* to draw a conclusion. Modus tollens states: If P \u2192 Q is true, and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must also be true.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n\nSince \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is true, we can conclude that \"Joe did not go to the park\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
