            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be represented as:\n\n   If P (shirt is cotton), then Q (pants are denim).\n\n* **Given Information:** \"The pants were not denim.\" This means  'not Q' is true.\n\n* **Logical Inference:**  We can use a rule called *modus tollens* to draw a conclusion. Modus tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying this to our situation:\n\nIf the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q). The pants were not denim (not Q). Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (not P).\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
