This does not mean that if the truck is blue, the car MUST be red. There could be other reasons for the truck to be blue.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **Premise:** If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* **Conclusion:** If the ground is wet (Q), then it's raining (P).\n\nThe ground could be wet for reasons other than rain (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
