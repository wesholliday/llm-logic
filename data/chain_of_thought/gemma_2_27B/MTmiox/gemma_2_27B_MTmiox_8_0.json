            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The sprocket might not have been daggled. This means it's possible the sprocket was daggled, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This is a conditional statement - if the first part (cranked) is true, then the second part (daggled) must also be true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\n*  Since the sprocket might not have been daggled, it's possible it wasn't cranked.  The first premise doesn't rule out the possibility of cranking.\n\n* However, if the sprocket *was* cranked, then it *must* have been daggled (according to the second premise).\n\n* Since we know the sprocket might not have been daggled, it follows that it might not have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
