It tells us that plooking the shank *always* results in the shank being nugged.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nSince the shank might not have been nugged (Statement 1), and plooking always leads to nugging (Statement 2), the only way for the shank to *not* be nugged is if it was never plooked in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
