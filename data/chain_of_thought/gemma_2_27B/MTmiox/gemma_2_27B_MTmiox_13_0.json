This means it's possible the glip tragged, but it's also possible it didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that slogging *guarantees* tragging.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the glip was not slogged.\n\nSince the glip might not have tragged, and slogging *always* leads to tragging, the only way for the glip to potentially *not* have tragged is if it wasn't slogged in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
