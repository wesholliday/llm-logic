This means it's possible the zinger was smoogled, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that fraggling *implies* smoogling.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nSince the zinger might not have been smoogled (Premise 1), and fraggling implies smoogling (Premise 2), it's possible the zinger was fraggled but not smoogled. This would contradict Premise 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
