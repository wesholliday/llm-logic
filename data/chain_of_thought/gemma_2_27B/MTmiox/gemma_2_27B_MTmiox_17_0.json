This means it's possible the flob did movate, but it's also possible it didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that skizzleness *guarantees* movation.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The flob was not skizzled\".\n\nSince the flob might not have movated, and skizzleness *always* leads to movation, it's possible the flob wasn't skizzled.  If it were skizzled, it would *have* to have movated, and we know that's not certain.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
