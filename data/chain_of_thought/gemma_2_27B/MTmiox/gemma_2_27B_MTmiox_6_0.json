This means it's possible the grommet did plop the frink, but it's also possible it didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. This sets up a conditional relationship: sploffed grommet implies plopped frink.\n\nWe're asked to infer whether the grommet was not sploffed.  \n\nSince the first premise says the grommet *might not* have plopped the frink, and the second premise says plopping the frink is a *necessary* result of being sploffed, we can conclude the grommet couldn't have been sploffed. If it were sploffed, it would definitely have plopped the frink, contradicting the first premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
