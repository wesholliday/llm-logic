This means it's possible the splat didn't quank.\n* **Premise 2:** If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked. This sets up a rule: morphing implies quanking.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nSince the splat might not have quanked, and morphing *requires* quanking, it's possible the splat wasn't morphed.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
