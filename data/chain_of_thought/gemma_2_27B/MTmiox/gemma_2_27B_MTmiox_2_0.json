This doesn't directly tell us anything about whether the wug was flooped or not.\n* Premise 2 establishes a conditional relationship: if the wug was flooped, then it *must* have bimmed the zoint.\n\nSince Premise 1 says the wug *might not* have bimmed the zoint, and Premise 2 says bimming the zoint is a *necessary* consequence of being flooped, we can infer that the wug couldn't have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
