This means it's possible the dreb was spened, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that vroombing *always* leads to spening.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nSince the dreb might not have been spened (Premise 1), and vroombing *always* leads to spening (Premise 2), it's possible the dreb was never vroombed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
