This means it's possible the flugel was zargled, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that blimmed implies zargled.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nSince the flugel might not have been zargled, and we know that blimmed implies zargled, it's possible the flugel was never blimmed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
