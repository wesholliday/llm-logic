This means it's possible the clug was snugged, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that fleeking a clug *requires* it to be snugged.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nSince the clug might not have been snugged, and fleeking requires snugging, it's possible the clug was never fleeked.  We don't have enough information to say for sure that it *was* fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
