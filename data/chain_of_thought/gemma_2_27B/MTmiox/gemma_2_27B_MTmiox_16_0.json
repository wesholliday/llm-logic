This means it's possible the sneg did sprot the frink, but it's also possible it didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink. This sets up a conditional relationship: if the first part (sneg being crampled) is true, then the second part (sneg sproting the frink) *must* also be true.\n\nWe're asked if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nSince Premise 1 says the sneg *might not* have sproted the frink, and Premise 2 says sproting the frink is a *necessary* outcome if the sneg was crampled, we can conclude the sneg couldn't have been crampled. If it were crampled, it would have definitely sproted the frink, contradicting Premise 1.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
