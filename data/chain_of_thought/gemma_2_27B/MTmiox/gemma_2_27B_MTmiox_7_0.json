This means it's possible the whiffle did not tinkle.\n* **Premise 2:** If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked. This sets up a conditional relationship: shanking implies tinking.\n\nWe're asked if we can conclude \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nSince the whiffle might not have tinked, and shanking would necessarily lead to tinking, it's possible the whiffle wasn't shanked.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
