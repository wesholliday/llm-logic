This means it's possible the twonk is varnished, but it's also possible it isn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that plinking *guarantees* varnishing.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The twonk was not plinked\".\n\nSince the twonk might not be varnished (Premise 1), and plinking guarantees varnishing (Premise 2), it's possible the twonk wasn't plinked.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
