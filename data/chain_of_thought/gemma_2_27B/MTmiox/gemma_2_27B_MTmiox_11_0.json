This means it's possible the flug was zimmed, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that blumming *always* leads to zimming.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the flug was not blummed.\n\nSince the flug might not have been zimmed, and we know that blumming leads to zimming, it's possible the flug was never blummed in the first place.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
