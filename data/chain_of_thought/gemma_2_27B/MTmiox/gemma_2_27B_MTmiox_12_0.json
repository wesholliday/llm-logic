This doesn't definitively say the smip *didn't* lupp the zoint, just that it's a possibility.\n* Premise 2 is a conditional statement. It says that *if* the smip was shripped, *then* it must have lupped the zoint. This doesn't tell us anything about whether the smip was actually shripped or not.\n\nSince Premise 1 leaves open the possibility that the smip didn't lupp the zoint, and Premise 2 only talks about what *would happen if* the smip was shripped, we cannot definitively conclude that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
