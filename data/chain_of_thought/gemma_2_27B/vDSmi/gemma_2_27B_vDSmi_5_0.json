A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. (This sets up the two possibilities)\n* **Premise 2:** The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. (This eliminates one of the possibilities)\n* **Conclusion:** The cookies are in the jar. (This affirms the remaining possibility)\n\nFor a disjunctive syllogism to be valid, the following must hold:\n\n1. The two premises must present a genuine disjunction (meaning one of the options *must* be true).\n2. One of the disjuncts must be negated (ruled out) in the second premise.\n\nIn this case, both conditions are met. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
