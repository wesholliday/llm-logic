A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. (This sets up the two possibilities)\n* **Premise 2:** The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. (This eliminates one of the possibilities)\n* **Conclusion:** The notebook is in the drawer. (This affirms the remaining possibility)\n\nFor a disjunctive syllogism to be valid, both premises must be true. In this case, the first premise is a true statement (it presents two possible locations for the notebook). The second premise is also potentially true; it doesn't definitively say the notebook *isn't* on the nightstand, just that it *might not* be.\n\nSince the premises could be true, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
