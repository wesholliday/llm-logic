Disjunctive syllogism states that if you have a statement of the form \"Either P or Q\" and you know that \"Not Q\" is true, then you can conclude that \"P\" must be true.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the remote control is on the coffee table (P) or it must be hiding under the couch (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The remote control might not be hiding under the couch (Not Q).\n\nSince the premises fit the structure of a disjunctive syllogism, and the second premise negates one of the options in the first premise, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
