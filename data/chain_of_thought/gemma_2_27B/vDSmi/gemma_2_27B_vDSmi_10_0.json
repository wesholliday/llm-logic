A disjunctive syllogism is valid if it follows this structure:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either P or Q\n* **Premise 2:** Not Q\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, P\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n* Q: The missing sock is under the bed.\n\nThe argument states that either the sock is in the laundry basket or under the bed (Premise 1). It then states that the sock might not be under the bed (Premise 2), which is equivalent to \"Not Q\".  Therefore, based on the structure of a disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion that the missing sock is in the laundry basket is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
