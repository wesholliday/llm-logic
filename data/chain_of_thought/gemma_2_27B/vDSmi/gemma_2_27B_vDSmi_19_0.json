A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other must be true.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either P or Q (The watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist)\n* **Premise 2:** Not Q (The watch might not be on his wrist)\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, P (The watch is charging on the dresser)\n\nFor a disjunctive syllogism to be valid, both premises must be true. In this case, the first premise is a valid statement of alternatives. The second premise introduces doubt about one of the alternatives (the watch being on his wrist). This doubt is sufficient to eliminate that possibility, leaving the other alternative (the watch charging on the dresser) as the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
