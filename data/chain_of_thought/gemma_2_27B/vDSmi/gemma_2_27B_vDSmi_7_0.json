Disjunctive syllogism states that if you have a statement of the form \"Either P or Q\" and you know that \"Not Q\" is true, then you can conclude that \"P\" must be true.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the umbrella is in the car (P) or it must be tucked away in the closet (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet (Not Q).\n\nSince the second premise suggests that Q (umbrella in the closet) might be false, and we have the first premise stating that one of the two options must be true, the conclusion that the umbrella is in the car (P) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
