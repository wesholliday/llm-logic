A disjunctive syllogism is valid if it follows this structure:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either P or Q\n* **Premise 2:** Not Q\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the toy is in the toy box (P) or it is sitting on the shelf (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The toy might not be sitting on the shelf (Not Q).\n\nSince the second premise doesn't definitively state \"The toy is not on the shelf,\" but rather \"The toy might not be on the shelf,\" the argument doesn't strictly follow the structure of a disjunctive syllogism.  The second premise leaves open the possibility that the toy could be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
