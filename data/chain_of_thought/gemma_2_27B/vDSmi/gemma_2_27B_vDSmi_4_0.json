Disjunctive syllogism states that if you have a statement of the form \"Either P or Q\" and you know that \"Not Q\" is true, then you can conclude \"P\" must be true.\n\n* **Premise 1:** Either the cat is napping on the couch (P) or it must be playing in the bedroom (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The cat might not be playing in the bedroom (Not Q).\n\nThis structure aligns with the disjunctive syllogism form.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
