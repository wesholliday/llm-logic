Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane.\n* Q: Erin took a train.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, and it also states that Erin did not take a train. Therefore, it logically follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
