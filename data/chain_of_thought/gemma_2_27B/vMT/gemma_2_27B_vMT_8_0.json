Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake.\n* Q: The mummy was awake.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake. It then states that the mummy was not awake, leading to the conclusion that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
