Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The apple was red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. It then states that the banana is not yellow, therefore concluding that the apple must not be red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
