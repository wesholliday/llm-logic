Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The cake was chocolate.\n* Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins would be blueberry (Q). It then states that the muffins were not blueberry (not Q). Therefore, it logically follows that the cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
