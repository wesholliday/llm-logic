Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = Ben ate pasta\n* Q = Kate ate salad\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as the premises state that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and Kate did not eat salad. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
