Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = Joe went to the park\n* Q = Lucy went to the zoo\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as it states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. Since Lucy did not go to the zoo, the conclusion logically follows that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
