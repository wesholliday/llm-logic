Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = Alex finished the race\n* Q = Chris finished the race\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as the premises state that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race, but Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
