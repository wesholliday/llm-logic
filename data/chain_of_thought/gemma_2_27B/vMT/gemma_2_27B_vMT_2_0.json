Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest. Since the unicorn was not in the forest, the griffin must also not be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
