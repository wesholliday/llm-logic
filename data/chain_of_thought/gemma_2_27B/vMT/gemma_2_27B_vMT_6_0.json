Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Sue chose pizza.\n* Q: Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. It then states that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, it logically follows that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
