Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The shirt was cotton.\n* Q: The pants were denim.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants would be denim (Q). It then states that the pants were not denim (not Q). Therefore, it logically follows that the shirt was not cotton (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
