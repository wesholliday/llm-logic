Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = Jeff played basketball\n* Q = Amy played tennis\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as the premises lead logically to the conclusion. If Amy did not play tennis, and we know that if Jeff played basketball then Amy would have played tennis, then it must be true that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
