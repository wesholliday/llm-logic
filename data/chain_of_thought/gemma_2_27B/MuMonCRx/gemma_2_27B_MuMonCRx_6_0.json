This means that for the crunk to be true, it needs to satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. It must be \"zibble snizzle\".\n2. It must be \"flimble at snorkel zibble\".\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that \"The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble\". Since the original statement explicitly states this as a necessary condition, we can indeed infer this.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
