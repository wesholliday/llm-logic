There could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\n* **Example:**\n\n   If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n   The ground is wet (Q).\n   Therefore, it's raining (P).\n\nThe ground could be wet for reasons other than rain (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nIn our original argument:\n\n* P: The dog was inside.\n* Q: The cat was outside.\n\nJust because the cat is outside doesn't guarantee the dog is inside. The cat could be outside for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
