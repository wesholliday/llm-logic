Here's why:\n\n* **Affirming the consequent** takes the form:\n\n   If P, then Q.\n   Q is true.\n   Therefore, P is true.\n\n* **The problem:** Just because the consequent (Q) is true doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (P) is also true. There could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\n* **In our example:**\n\n   P: The bear was in the cave.\n   Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\nEven though the wolf being in the den is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the bear was in the cave. There could be other reasons for the wolf to be in the den.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
