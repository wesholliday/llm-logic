This means the argument structure is:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nQ is true.\nTherefore, P is true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The doll was plastic.\n* Q: The truck was metal.\n\nWhile the premises might be true, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow. It's possible for the truck to be metal for reasons unrelated to the doll being plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
