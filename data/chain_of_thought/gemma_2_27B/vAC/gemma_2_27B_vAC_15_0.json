This is a common logical fallacy.  \n\nHere's why it's invalid:\n\n* **The original statement only tells us what happens IF Sam took a plane.** It doesn't say that Sam taking a plane is the *only* way Erin could take a train. \n\n* **Erin could have taken a train for a completely different reason.**  Maybe Erin always takes the train, regardless of Sam's travel plans.\n\nBecause there could be other explanations for Erin taking the train, we can't logically conclude that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
