Here's why:\n\n* **No connection:** The two sentences share some words (\"wibble\" and \"fribble zizz\"), but there's no logical connection established between them. \n* **New elements:** The second sentence introduces new words (\"blimp\", \"zibble\", \"plimp\") that have no basis in the first sentence.\n\nWe can't assume these new elements are related to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
