It means that plinking the twonk *guarantees* varnishing.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The twonk might not have been varnished.\" This statement tells us varnishing might not have happened.\n\nSince varnishing is a *necessary* result of plinking (from statement 1), if the twonk wasn't varnished (statement 2), then it couldn't have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
