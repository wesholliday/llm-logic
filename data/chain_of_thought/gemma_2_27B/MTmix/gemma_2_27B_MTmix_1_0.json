It tells us that zargling is a necessary consequence of blimmeding.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The flugel might not have been zargled.\" This statement tells us that zargling might not have happened.\n\nSince zargling is a necessary consequence of blimmeding, if the flugel wasn't zargled, it couldn't have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
