This sets up a cause-and-effect relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The whiffle might not have tinked. This introduces doubt about the effect.\n\nSince the first premise states that shanking *always* leads to tinking, and the second premise says tinking *might not* have happened, we can conclude that the initial condition (shanking) likely didn't occur.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
