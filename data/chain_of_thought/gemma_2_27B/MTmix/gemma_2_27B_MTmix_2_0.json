It suggests that flooping causes bimming the zoint.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The wug might not have bimmed the zoint.\" This statement tells us bimming the zoint might not have happened.\n\nWe need to see if these statements logically lead to the conclusion \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nSince the first statement says bimming the zoint *must* happen if the wug was flooped, and the second statement says bimming the zoint *might not* have happened, we can infer that the wug *might not* have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
