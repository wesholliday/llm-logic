It means that if the first part (the clug being fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug being snugged) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The clug might not have been snugged.\" This statement tells us that it's possible the clug was not snugged.\n\nNow, we need to see if we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nSince the clug might not have been snugged, it's possible that the first part of the conditional statement (the clug being fleeked) is false.  \n\nRemember, a conditional statement only tells us what happens if the first part is true. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the first part is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
