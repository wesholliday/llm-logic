This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The dreb might not have been spened. This means it's possible the dreb was not spened.\n\nWe need to see if these premises lead to the conclusion \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nSince the first premise only states what happens *if* the dreb was vroombed, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if it *wasn't* vroombed. The second premise tells us spening might not have occurred.  Because spening is a necessary condition for vroombing (according to the first premise), if spening didn't happen, vroombing couldn't have happened either.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
