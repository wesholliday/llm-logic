It means that if the first part (the shank being plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank being nugged) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The shank might not have been nugged.\" This statement tells us that it's possible the shank was not nugged.\n\nNow, consider these possibilities:\n\n* **If the shank was plooked:** According to statement 1, it would have to be nugged. This contradicts statement 2.\n\n* **If the shank was not plooked:** This doesn't contradict statement 2, as it's possible for the shank to not be nugged regardless of whether it was plooked or not.\n\nSince the first possibility leads to a contradiction, the only remaining possibility is that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
