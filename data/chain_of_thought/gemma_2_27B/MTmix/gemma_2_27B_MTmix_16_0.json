(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** The sneg might not have sproted the frink. (This means it's possible the sneg did NOT sprot the frink)\n\nWe need to see if these premises lead to the conclusion \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\n*  If the sneg sproted the frink, then it must have been crampled (according to Premise 1).\n* Premise 2 tells us the sneg *might not* have sproted the frink.\n\nThis means there's a possibility the sneg didn't sprot the frink, and therefore, according to Premise 1, it also might not have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
