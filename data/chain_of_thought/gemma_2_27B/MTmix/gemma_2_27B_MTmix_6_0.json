            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the second part (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\" This statement tells us that it's possible the grommet didn't plop the frink.\n\nNow, consider this:\n\nIf the grommet *was* sploffed (making the first part of Statement 1 true), then Statement 1 says the grommet *must* have plopped the frink. But Statement 2 says the grommet *might not* have plopped the frink. These two statements contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be possibly true is if the grommet was *not* sploffed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
