(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It might not have been surned. (This means it's possible that Q is false)\n\nWe can use a truth table to analyze this.  \n\n| P (Bluttered) | Q (Surned) | If P, then Q |\n|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | True |\n| False | False | True |\n\nSince we know Q (surned) *might* be false, we can see from the truth table that P (bluttered) could be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
