It means that snurgling *always* leads to crinking.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The fribble might not have crinked.\" This statement tells us crinking didn't necessarily happen.\n\nSince snurgling *always* leads to crinking, if the fribble didn't crink, it couldn't have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
