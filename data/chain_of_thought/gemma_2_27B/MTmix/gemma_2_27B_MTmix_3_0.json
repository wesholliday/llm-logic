It tells us that morphing *guarantees* quanking.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The splat might not have quanked.\" This statement tells us quanking *might not* have happened.\n\nNow, if we assume the splat *was* morphed (according to Statement 1), then quanking *must* have happened. But Statement 2 says quanking *might not* have happened. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the splat was morphed must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
