It tells us that if the first part (the flug being blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug being zimmed) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The flug might not have been zimmed.\" This statement tells us that it's possible the flug was not zimmed.\n\nNow, consider the logic:\n\nIf the flug was blummed, it *must* have been zimmed (according to statement 1). But we know it *might not* have been zimmed (statement 2).  This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the initial condition in statement 1 is false. In other words, the flug could not have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
