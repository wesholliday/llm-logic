It means that cranking the sprocket *always* leads to the sprocket being daggled.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\" This statement tells us there's a possibility the sprocket was *not* daggled.\n\nNow, if we combine these statements, we encounter a contradiction. If the sprocket was cranked (according to statement 1), it *must* have been daggled. But statement 2 says it *might not* have been daggled.  \n\nThis contradiction means the initial premise, that the sprocket was cranked, must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
