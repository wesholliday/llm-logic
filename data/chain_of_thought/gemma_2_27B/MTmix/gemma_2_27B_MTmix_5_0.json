This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The zinger might not have been smoogled. This means it's possible the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nWe need to see if these premises lead to the conclusion \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nSince the zinger *might not* have been smoogled, it's possible the condition in the first premise (being fraggled) is false.  If the condition is false, the conclusion (being smoogled) doesn't have to be true.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nIf it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n\nBut if the ground is not wet (not Q), we can't automatically conclude it wasn't raining (not P). Maybe the ground dried quickly, or there was another reason it's not wet.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
