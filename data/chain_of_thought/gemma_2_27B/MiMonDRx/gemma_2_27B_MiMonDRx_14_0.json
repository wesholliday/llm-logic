The question asks if we can infer that a flibbit can also \"flump frazzle\" or \"frazzle flim\". Since the original sentence only mentions \"frazzle flim\", we cannot infer that a flibbit can also \"flump frazzle\". However, we can infer that a flibbit can \"frazzle flim\" because the original sentence explicitly states this.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
