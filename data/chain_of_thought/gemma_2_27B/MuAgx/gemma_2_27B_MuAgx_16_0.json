We can break this down into two parts:\n\n1. \"The flibbit must be quibble crunk\"\n2. \"it must snork zooble wozzle\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the entire original statement from the first part. Since the first part only states the flibbit must be quibble crunk, and doesn't mention anything about snorking zooble wozzle, we cannot infer the entire original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
