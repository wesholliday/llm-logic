We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The fribble is not crinked.** (This negates the first option in the \"or\" statement).\n\nSince the fribble cannot be crinked (premise 2), the only remaining option to satisfy the \"or\" statement in premise 1 is that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
