We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.** (This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true).\n2. **The sprocket is not daggled.** (This is a negation).\n\nSince the sprocket cannot be both daggled and not daggled, the first premise tells us that if it's not daggled, it *must* be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
