(This presents two possibilities)\n* **Premise 2:** The shank is not nugged. (This eliminates one of the possibilities from Premise 1)\n\nSince the shank cannot be nugged (Premise 2), and it must be either nugged or plooked (Premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
