We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The grommet is not plopped.** (This negates the first option in the \"or\" statement).\n\nSince the grommet cannot be plopped (premise 2), and it must be either plopped or sploffed (premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
