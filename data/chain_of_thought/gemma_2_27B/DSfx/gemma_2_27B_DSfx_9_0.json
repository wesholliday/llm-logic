We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The twonk is not plinked.** (This negates one of the options from the first premise).\n\nSince the twonk cannot be plinked (premise 2), the only remaining option to satisfy the first premise is that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
