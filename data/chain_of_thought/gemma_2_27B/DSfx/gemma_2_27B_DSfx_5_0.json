We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.** (This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other must be true).\n2. **The zinger is not smoogled.** (This negates the first part of the disjunction).\n\nSince the zinger cannot be smoogled (premise 2), the only remaining option to satisfy the first premise is that the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
