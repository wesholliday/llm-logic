We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The flob is not movated.** (This negates the first option in the \"or\" statement).\n\nSince the flob cannot be both movated and not movated, the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
