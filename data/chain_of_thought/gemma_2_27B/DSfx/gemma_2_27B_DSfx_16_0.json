We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled.** (This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other must be true).\n2. **The sneg is not sproted.** (This negates the first part of the disjunction).\n\nSince the sneg cannot be both sproted and not sproted, the only remaining possibility is that it is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
