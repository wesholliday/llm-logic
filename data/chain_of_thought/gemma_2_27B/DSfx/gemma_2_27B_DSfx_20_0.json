We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The fleeg is not surned.**\n\nSince the fleeg cannot be both surned and not surned, the first premise tells us that if it's not surned, it *must* be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
