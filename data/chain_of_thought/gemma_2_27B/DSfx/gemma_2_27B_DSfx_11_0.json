We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The flug is not zimmed.** (This negates the first option in the \"or\" statement).\n\nSince the flug cannot be zimmed, the only remaining possibility to satisfy the first premise is that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
