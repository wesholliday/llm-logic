We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.** This presents us with two possibilities, and we know one of them must be true.\n2. **The whiffle is not tinked.** This eliminates the first possibility.\n\nSince the whiffle cannot be tinked, and it must be either tinked or shanked, the only remaining possibility is that it is shanked. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
