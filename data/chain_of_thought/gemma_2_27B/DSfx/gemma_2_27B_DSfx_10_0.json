We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The wug is not garpled.** (This negates the first option in the \"or\" statement).\n\nSince the wug cannot be garpled (premise 2), the only remaining option to satisfy the \"or\" statement in premise 1 is that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
