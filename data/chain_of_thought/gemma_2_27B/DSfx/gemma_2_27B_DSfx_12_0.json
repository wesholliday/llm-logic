We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.** This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other option must be true.\n2. **The smip is not lupped.** This negates the first part of the disjunction.\n\nSince the smip cannot be both lupped and not lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
