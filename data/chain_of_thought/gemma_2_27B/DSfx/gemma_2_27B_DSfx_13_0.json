We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged.** (This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true).\n2. **The glip is not tragged.** (This is a negation).\n\nSince the first premise states that the glip must be either tragged or slogged, and the second premise tells us it's not tragged, the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
