We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.** This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other option must be true.\n2. **The flugel is not zargled.** This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction.\n\nSince the flugel cannot be both zargled and not zargled, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
