We have two premises:\n\n1. **Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.** (This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true).\n2. **The smonk is not plagged.** (This negates the first option in the \"or\" statement).\n\nSince the smonk cannot be plagged (premise 2), the only remaining option to satisfy the \"or\" statement in premise 1 is that the smonk must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
