We are given a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This doesn't mean that Kate *only* eats salad when Ben eats pasta, just that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate eating salad is a guaranteed outcome.\n\nWe are also told that \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" Since the condition (Ben eating pasta) is false, we cannot conclude anything about Kate eating salad. The original statement only tells us what happens *if* Ben eats pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
