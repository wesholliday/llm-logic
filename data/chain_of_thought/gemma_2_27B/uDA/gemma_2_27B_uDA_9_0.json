It doesn't say anything about what happens if Lisa *doesn't* buy the red shirt.\n2. **Lisa did not buy the red shirt.**\n\nSince Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, the first statement doesn't apply.  We can't conclude anything about Mark's shirt purchase based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
