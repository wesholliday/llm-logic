            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic logic problem dealing with conditional statements. \n\n* **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be written symbolically as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** Tom did not watch football. This can be written symbolically as: \u00acP (Not P)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball (\u00acQ).\n\nSince Tom didn't watch football (\u00acP), the first premise (P \u2192 Q) doesn't tell us anything definitive about Jen's actions. The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* Tom watches football. It doesn't say anything about what happens if he doesn't.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
