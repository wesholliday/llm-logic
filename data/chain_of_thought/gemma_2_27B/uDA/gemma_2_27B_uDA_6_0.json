This means that Bob choosing pasta is dependent on Sue choosing pizza.\n* We are also told that Sue did not choose pizza. \n* Since the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is false, we cannot conclude anything about Bob's choice. The original statement only tells us what happens when Sue chooses pizza, not what happens when she doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
