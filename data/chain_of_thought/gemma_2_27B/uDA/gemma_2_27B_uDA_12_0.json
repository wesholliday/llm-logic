We are given a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This doesn't mean that Lucy *only* goes to the zoo if Joe goes to the park, just that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy going to the zoo is a guaranteed outcome.\n\nWe are also told that \"Joe did not go to the park.\" Since the first statement is conditional, and the condition (Joe going to the park) is false, we cannot conclude anything definitive about Lucy's actions.  It's possible she went to the zoo, or she didn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
