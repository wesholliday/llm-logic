            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic logic problem dealing with conditional statements. \n\n* **Premise 1:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This sets up a rule: cotton shirt implies denim pants.\n* **Premise 2:** The shirt was not cotton. This negates the condition in the first premise.\n\nSince the condition for the first premise (cotton shirt) is not met, we cannot automatically conclude anything about the pants. The rule only applies if the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
