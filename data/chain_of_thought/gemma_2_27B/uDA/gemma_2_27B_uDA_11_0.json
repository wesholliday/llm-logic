It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake is *not* chocolate.\n* The second part tells us \"the cake was not chocolate.\" This means the condition for the first statement wasn't met.\n\nSince the condition for the first statement wasn't met, we can't automatically conclude anything about the muffins.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
