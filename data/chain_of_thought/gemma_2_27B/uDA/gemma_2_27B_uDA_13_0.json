We are given a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that the truth of the second part (truck being blue) depends on the truth of the first part (car being red).\n\nWe are also told that \"the car was not red.\" Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the second part. The truck could be blue, or it could be any other color.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
