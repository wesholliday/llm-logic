            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument. We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.** This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. **Mary was not at the wedding.** This is a direct statement about Mary's presence.\n\nSince Mary was not at the wedding, the condition in the first premise is false.  Because the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's presence at the wedding. The second part of the conditional statement doesn't have to be true or false in this case.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
