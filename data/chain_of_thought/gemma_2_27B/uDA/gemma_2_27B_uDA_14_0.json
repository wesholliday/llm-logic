We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.** This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true.\n\n2. **The bear was not in the cave.** This is a negation of the antecedent in the first premise.\n\nSince the antecedent of the first premise is false (the bear was not in the cave), we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the consequent (the wolf being in the den). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the antecedent is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
