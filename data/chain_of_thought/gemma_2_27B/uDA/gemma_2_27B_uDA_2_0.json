We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.** This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the second part (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n\n2. **The griffin was not in the forest.** This is a direct statement about the griffin's location.\n\nSince the griffin was not in the forest, the condition in the first premise is false. This means the conclusion of the first premise (the unicorn being in the forest) does not necessarily have to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
