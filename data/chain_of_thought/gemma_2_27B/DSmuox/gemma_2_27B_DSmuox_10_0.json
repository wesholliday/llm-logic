It rules out the wug *definitely* being garpled.\n\n* **\"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled\"**: This presents two possibilities: the wug is sproinged, or it *must* be garpled.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the wug doesn't *have* to be garpled, the second statement's \"or it must be garpled\" part becomes false.  This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the second statement:\n\n* **The wug is sproinged.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
