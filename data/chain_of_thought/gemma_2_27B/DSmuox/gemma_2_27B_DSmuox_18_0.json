It could be nugged, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\" This presents two possibilities: the shank is plooked, or it must be nugged.\n\nSince we know the shank doesn't *have* to be nugged (from Statement 1), the only remaining possibility from Statement 2 is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
