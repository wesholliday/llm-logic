It could be daggled, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This presents two possibilities: the sprocket is cranked, or it must be daggled.\n\nSince we know the sprocket doesn't *have* to be daggled (from Statement 1), the only remaining possibility from Statement 2 is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
