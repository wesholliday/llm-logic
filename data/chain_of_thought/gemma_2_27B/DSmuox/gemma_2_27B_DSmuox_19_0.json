It could be plagged, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\" This presents two possibilities: the smonk is vreebled, or it must be plagged.\n\nSince we know the smonk doesn't *have* to be plagged (from Statement 1), the only remaining possibility from Statement 2 is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
