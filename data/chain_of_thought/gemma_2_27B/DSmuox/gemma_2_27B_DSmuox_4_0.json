It rules out the fribble *definitely* being crinked.\n\n* **\"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\"**: This presents two possibilities: the fribble is snurgled, or if it's not snurgled, then it *must* be crinked.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the fribble doesn't *have* to be crinked, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
