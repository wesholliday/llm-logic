It could be plopped, or it could be something else entirely.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\" This presents two possibilities: the grommet is sploffed, or it must be plopped.\n\nSince we know from Statement 1 that the grommet doesn't *have* to be plopped, the only remaining possibility from Statement 2 is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
