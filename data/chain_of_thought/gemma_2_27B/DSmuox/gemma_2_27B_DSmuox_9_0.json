It could be plinked, or it could not be.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\" This presents two possibilities: the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked.\n\n* **Combining the statements:** We know the twonk doesn't *have* to be plinked (Statement 1).  Since Statement 2 says it must be either varnished or plinked, and it can't be plinked, the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
