It could be snugged, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\" This presents two possibilities: the clug is fleeked, OR it must be snugged.\n\nSince we know the clug doesn't *have* to be snugged (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
