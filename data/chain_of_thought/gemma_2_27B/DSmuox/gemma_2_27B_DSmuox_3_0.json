It could be quanked, or it could not be.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This presents two possibilities: the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked.\n\nSince we know the splat doesn't *have* to be quanked (from statement 1), the only way for statement 2 to be true is if the splat *is* morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
