It could be tinked, or it could not be.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\" This presents two possibilities: the whiffle is shanked, or it must be tinked.\n\nSince we know the whiffle doesn't *have* to be tinked (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
