It could be sproted, or it could be something else entirely.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\" This presents two possibilities: the sneg is crampled, or it must be sproted.\n\nSince we know the sneg doesn't *have* to be sproted (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
