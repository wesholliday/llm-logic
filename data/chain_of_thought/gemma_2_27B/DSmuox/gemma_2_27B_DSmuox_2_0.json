It could be bimmed, or it could not be.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\" This presents two possibilities: the wug is flooped, or it must be bimmed.\n\nWe know from Statement 1 that the wug doesn't *have* to be bimmed.  Since Statement 2 says it must be *either* flooped *or* bimmed, and we know it doesn't have to be bimmed, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
