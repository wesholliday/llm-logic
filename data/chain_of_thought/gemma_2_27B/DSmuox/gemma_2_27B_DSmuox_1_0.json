It could be zargled, or it could not be.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" This presents two possibilities: the flugel is blimmed, or it must be zargled.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the flugel doesn't *have* to be zargled, the second statement's \"or it must be zargled\" part becomes false.  This leaves us with only one true possibility from the second statement: \"the flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
