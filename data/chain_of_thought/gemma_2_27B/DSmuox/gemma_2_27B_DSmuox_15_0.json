It could be spened, or it could not be.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\" This presents two possibilities: the dreb is vroombed, or it must be spened.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the dreb doesn't *have* to be spened, the second statement's \"or it must be spened\" part becomes false.  This leaves us with only one true possibility from the second statement: \"the dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
