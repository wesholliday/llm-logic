It could be smoogled, or it could not be.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\" This presents two possibilities: the zinger is fraggled, or it must be smoogled.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the zinger doesn't *have* to be smoogled, the second statement's \"or it must be smoogled\" part becomes false.  This leaves us with only one true possibility from the second statement: \"the zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
