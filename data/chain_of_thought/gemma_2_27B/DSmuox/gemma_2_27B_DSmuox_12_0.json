It could be lupped, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\" This presents two possibilities: the smip is shripped, or it must be lupped.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the smip doesn't *have* to be lupped, the second statement's \"or it must be lupped\" part becomes false.  This leaves us with only one true possibility from the second statement: \"the smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
