Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The smip was shripped.\n* Q: The smip lupped the zoint.\n\nWe are given \"Not Q\" (Premise 1) and \"If P, then Q\" (Premise 2). Therefore, we can logically conclude \"Not P\" (The smip was not shripped).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
