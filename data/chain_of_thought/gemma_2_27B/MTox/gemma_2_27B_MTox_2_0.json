Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's map our premises to this structure:\n\n* **P:** The wug was flooped.\n* **Q:** The wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nWe are given that \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" (Not Q) and \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" (If P, then Q).  Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"The wug was not flooped\" (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
