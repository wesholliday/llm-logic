It tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then garpling *must* have also happened.\n\nSince we know the wug was *not* garpled (from statement 1), and garpling would have happened if the wug was sproinged (from statement 2), we can conclude that the wug could not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
