It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the sneg being crampled), then a certain consequence follows (the sneg sproting the frink).\n\nSince we know from Premise 1 that the sneg did *not* sproted the frink, and Premise 2 states that sproting the frink would only happen if the sneg was crampled, we can conclude that the sneg must not have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
