If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude that \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nThis situation represents a classic example of *modus tollens* in logic. Modus tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q,\" then we can conclude \"not P.\"\n\n* In our case, P is \"The flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"The flob movated.\"\n* We know \"not Q\" (The flob did not movate).\n\nTherefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude \"not P\" (The flob was not skizzled).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
