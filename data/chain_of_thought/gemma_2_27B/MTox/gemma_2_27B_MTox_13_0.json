If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nWe can analyze this using a conditional statement structure:\n\n* **If P, then Q**  where P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged\".\n\nWe know that statement 1 tells us \"not Q\" is true.  Since the conditional statement is true, and we know Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
