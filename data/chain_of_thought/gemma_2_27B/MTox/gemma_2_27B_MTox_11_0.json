If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it *must* also be zimmed.\n\nSince we know the flug was *not* zimmed (from the first statement), and the second statement says zimming follows from blumming, we can conclude that the flug could not have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
