It tells us that if the first part (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the second part (the smonk plagged) must also be true.\n\nWe know the smonk did not plagged. Since the only way the smonk could have plagged is if it was vreebled, and we know it didn't plagged, we can conclude it wasn't vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
