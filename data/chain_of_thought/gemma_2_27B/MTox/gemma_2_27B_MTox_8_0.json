It tells us that if the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the sprocket was *not* daggled, and the only way it could be daggled is if it was cranked, we can conclude that the sprocket must not have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
