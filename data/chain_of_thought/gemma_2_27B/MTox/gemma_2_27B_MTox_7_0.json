If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically conclude that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nThis scenario sets up a classic example of *modus tollens* reasoning. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The whiffle was shanked.\n* Q: The whiffle tinked.\n\nWe are given \"Not Q\" (The whiffle did not tink) and \"If P, then Q\".  Therefore, we can logically conclude \"Not P\" (The whiffle was not shanked).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
