It tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then it was also plopped.  However, it doesn't say that being plopped *means* it was sploffed. There could be other ways for a grommet to be plopped.\n\nSince we only know the grommet was plopped, and not that it was sploffed, we can't infer that it was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
