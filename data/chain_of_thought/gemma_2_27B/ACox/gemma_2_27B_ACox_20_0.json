It doesn't say that garpling *means* sproinging happened. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it rained, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean it rained? Not necessarily. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
