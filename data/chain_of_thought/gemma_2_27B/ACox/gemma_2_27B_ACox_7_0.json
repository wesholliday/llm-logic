However, just because the whiffle tinked doesn't necessarily mean it was shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle tinked.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nCan we conclude it's raining? Not necessarily. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
