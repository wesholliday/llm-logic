It tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it was tinked.  However, just because the whiffle was tinked doesn't automatically mean it was shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle was tinked.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nCan we conclude it's raining? No, because the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, the fact that the whiffle was tinked doesn't guarantee it was shanked.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
