Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\nIn our case, just because the splat was quanked (Q) doesn't mean it was necessarily morphed (P). There might be other ways for the splat to be quanked besides being morphed.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
