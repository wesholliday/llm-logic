If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nWhile these statements are true, they don't necessarily mean the zinger was fraggled. It's possible for the zinger to be smoogled without being fraggled.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* All dogs are mammals.\n* My pet is a mammal.\n\nDoes that mean my pet is a dog? No, it could be a cat, a whale, or any other mammal.\n\nSimilarly, just because something is smoogled doesn't automatically mean it was also fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
