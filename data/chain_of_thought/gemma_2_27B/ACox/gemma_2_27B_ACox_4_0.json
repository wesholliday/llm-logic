Just because the consequence (Q) is true (the fribble crinked) doesn't mean the antecedent (P) is also true (the fribble was snurgled). There could be other reasons why the fribble crinked.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
