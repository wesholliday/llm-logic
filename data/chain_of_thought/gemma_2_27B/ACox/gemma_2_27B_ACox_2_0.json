We also know that *if* the wug was flooped, *then* it would have bimmed the zoint. However, just because the wug bimmed the zoint doesn't mean it was flooped. There could be other reasons why the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
