It tells us that if the first part (the wug was flooped) is true, then the second part (the wug was bimmed) is also true.\n\nHowever, just because the wug was bimmed doesn't mean it was flooped. There could be other reasons why the wug was bimmed.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
