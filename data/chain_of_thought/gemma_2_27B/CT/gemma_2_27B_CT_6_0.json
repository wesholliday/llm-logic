The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n\n* If not Q (Bob did not choose pasta), then not P (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
