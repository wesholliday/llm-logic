The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order.  \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* Hypothesis: The apple was red.\n* Conclusion: The banana was yellow.\n\nThe contrapositive would be:\n\n* Hypothesis: The banana was not yellow.\n* Conclusion: The apple was not red.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
