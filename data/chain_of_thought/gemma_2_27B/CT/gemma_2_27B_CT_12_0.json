The converse is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is the inverse of the original: If not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo), then not P (Joe did not go to the park). The inverse is also not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* Joe going to the park might be the *reason* Lucy went to the zoo. But, Lucy could have gone to the zoo for a completely different reason, even if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
