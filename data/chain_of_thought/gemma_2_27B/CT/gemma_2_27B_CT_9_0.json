The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* If P, then Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n\n* If not Q, then not P (If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
