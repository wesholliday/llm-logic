The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q** (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order:\n\n* **If not Q, then not P** (If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
