    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nHere's how we can break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The fantole is the most likely winner, followed by the dribban, with the snorpul being the least likely.\n* **Premise 2:** If the dribban doesn't win, and the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul must win (since they are the only contenders).\n* **Premise 3:** The fantole is likely to win, which means the dribban is likely to lose.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?\"\n\nSince the fantole is the most likely winner, it's less likely that they *won't* win.  However, if the fantole *doesn't* win, the dribban is the next most likely candidate.  \n\nThe snorpul only wins if *both* the fantole and dribban lose. This scenario is less likely than just the fantole losing.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
