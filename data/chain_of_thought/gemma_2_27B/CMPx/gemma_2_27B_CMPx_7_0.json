    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

Premise 3 tells us the crastin is *likely* to lead, but not guaranteed.\n2. If the crastin *doesn't* lead, Premise 2 kicks in.\n3. Premise 2 states that if the crastin doesn't lead and the nivet doesn't lead, then the jomial will.\n\nSince the nivet is less likely to lead than the crastin (Premise 3), it's plausible that if the crastin doesn't lead, the jomial would.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
