    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

Premise 3 tells us fantole is likely to be #1.\n2. If fantole is #1, then dribban can't be #1 (Premise 1).\n3. If fantole is #1, cruggit can't be #1 (Premise 1).\n4. The only scenario where cruggit could be #1 is if fantole is NOT #1 (Premise 2).\n5. Since fantole is likely to be #1, it's unlikely that cruggit will be #1.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
