    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

This makes the scenario \"if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most\" a less probable situation.\n\nHowever, Premise 2 states that *if* this unlikely scenario happens (blimfet not bafwidging the most), then the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nTherefore, while the scenario itself is unlikely, if it *does* occur, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
