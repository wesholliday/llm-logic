    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

However, Premise 2 tells us that in this less probable scenario (fantug losing), the frallon is guaranteed to win if the loperit also loses (which is likely according to Premise 3).\n\nTherefore, while the fantug winning is the most likely outcome, the information suggests that if the fantug *doesn't* win, the frallon is indeed likely to win.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
