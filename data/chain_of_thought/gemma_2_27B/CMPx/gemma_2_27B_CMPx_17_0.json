    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Flinker, Dringen, and N\u00fcffen are the top prospects for a breakout season.\n* **Premise 2:** Flinker is most likely to have a breakout, followed by Dringen. N\u00fcffen is a long shot.\n* **Premise 3:** If Dringen doesn't have a breakout, and Flinker doesn't have a breakout, then N\u00fcffen will.\n* **Premise 4:** Scouts believe Flinker is likely to have a breakout, meaning Dringen is less likely.\n\nWe need to determine if it's likely that if Flinker doesn't have a breakout, N\u00fcffen will.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Since Flinker is the most likely to break out, it's less likely that they won't.\n\n2. If Flinker doesn't break out, and Dringen is already less likely to break out, then the scenario where neither Flinker nor Dringen break out becomes more probable.\n\n3. Premise 3 states that in this scenario (neither Flinker nor Dringen breaking out), N\u00fcffen will have a breakout.\n\nTherefore, given the premises, it's likely that if Flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the N\u00fcffen will.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
