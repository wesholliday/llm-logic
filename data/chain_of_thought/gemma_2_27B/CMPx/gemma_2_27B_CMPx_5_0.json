    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by Darpil, with Votal trailing behind.\n* **Premise 2:** If Darpil doesn't have the top record, and Fraglen doesn't either, then Votal will.\n* **Premise 3:** Fraglen is likely to lead the league, meaning Darpil is likely not to.\n\nWe need to determine if it's likely that if Fraglen doesn't lead, Votal will.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know Fraglen is *likely* to lead. This means there's a good chance they will, but it's not guaranteed.\n2. If Fraglen *doesn't* lead, Premise 2 tells us Votal will lead *only if* Darpil also doesn't lead.\n3. Since Fraglen is likely to lead, Darpil is likely *not* to lead (Premise 3).\n\nTherefore, if Fraglen doesn't lead, the conditions for Votal to lead (Fraglen not leading AND Darpil not leading) are likely to be met.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
