(True)\n* **Converse:** If the ground is wet, then it is raining. (False - the ground could be wet for other reasons)\n\nIn our case, just because the robot visiting Jupiter would prevent the alien from visiting Mars (according to the original statement), it doesn't mean that if the robot *didn't* visit Jupiter, the alien *must* have visited Mars. There could be other reasons why the alien didn't visit Mars.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
