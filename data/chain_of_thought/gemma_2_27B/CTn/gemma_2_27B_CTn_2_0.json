It doesn't, however, tell us anything about what happens if the unicorn is present. The unicorn could be in the forest without the griffin being there, or they could both be absent.  \n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* **Original statement:** \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Does this mean:** \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining?\"\n\nNo, because the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
