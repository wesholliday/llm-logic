Maybe the muffins are blueberry for a reason unrelated to the cake.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is the *converse* of the original:\n\n* **If Q, then P** (If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate)\n\nThe converse of a statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
