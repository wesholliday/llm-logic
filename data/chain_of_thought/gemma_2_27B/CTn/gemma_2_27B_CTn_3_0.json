The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q**  (If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order:\n\n* **If not Q, then not P**\n\nApplying this to our original statement:\n\n* **If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.**\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
