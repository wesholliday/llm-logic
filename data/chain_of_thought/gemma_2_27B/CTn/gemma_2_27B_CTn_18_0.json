Maybe the truck is metal for a reason unrelated to the doll being plastic.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is the converse of the original:\n\n* **If Q, then P** (If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic)\n\nThe converse of a statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
