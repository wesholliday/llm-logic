The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement doesn't tell us if the car actually *is* red, only that the truck being blue would be a consequence of the car being red. Since the truck is blue, the condition in the \"if\" part of the statement *could* be true, but we don't have enough information to know for sure.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
