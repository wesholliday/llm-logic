The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement is true unless Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark *didn't* buy the blue shirt. Since we know Mark did buy the blue shirt, the condition of the second statement is met. However, this doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt. The second statement only tells us what happens *if* Lisa bought the red shirt, not that she actually did.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
