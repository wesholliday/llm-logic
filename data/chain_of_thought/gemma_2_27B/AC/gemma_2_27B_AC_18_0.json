            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument where we have a conditional statement and a premise that matches the consequent of the conditional. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n* **Premise:** The truck was metal.\n\nThe structure of this argument resembles a *modus ponens* argument, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning.  Modus ponens states:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nQ is true.\nTherefore, P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The doll was plastic.\n* Q: The truck was metal.\n\nSince we know the truck was metal (Q is true), and the conditional statement links the doll being plastic to the truck being metal, we can infer that the doll must have been plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
