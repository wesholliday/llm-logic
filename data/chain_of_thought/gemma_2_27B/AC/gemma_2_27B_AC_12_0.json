We have a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This doesn't mean that Lucy *only* goes to the zoo if Joe goes to the park, just that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy going to the zoo is a guaranteed outcome. We also know \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"  \n\nWhile we know the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) is true, the conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the first part (Joe going to the park) is true. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the first part is false. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
