This doesn't mean that Erin *only* takes a train if Sam takes a plane, it just means that if Sam takes a plane, Erin taking a train is a guaranteed consequence. We also know that \"Erin took a train\".  However, this doesn't necessarily mean Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
