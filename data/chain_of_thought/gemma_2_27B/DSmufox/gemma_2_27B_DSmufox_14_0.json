This means the clug does *not* have to be snugged.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. This presents two possibilities: the clug is snugged, or it is fleeked.\n\nSince we know the clug doesn't have to be snugged (Premise 1), the only remaining possibility from Premise 2 is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
