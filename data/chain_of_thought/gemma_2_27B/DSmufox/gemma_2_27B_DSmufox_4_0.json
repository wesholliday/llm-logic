It could be crinked, or it could be something else.\n\n* **\"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\"**: This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the fribble doesn't *have* to be crinked, the second statement forces the conclusion that the fribble *must* be snurgled to satisfy the \"or\" condition.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
