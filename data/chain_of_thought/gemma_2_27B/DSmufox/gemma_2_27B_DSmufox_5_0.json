It could be smoogled, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **\"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\"**: This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the zinger doesn't *have* to be smoogled, the second statement forces us to conclude that the zinger *must* be fraggled to satisfy the \"or\" condition.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
