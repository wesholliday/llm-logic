This means the whiffle does *not* have to be tinked.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. This presents two possibilities: the whiffle must be tinked, or it must be shanked.\n\nSince we know from Premise 1 that the whiffle doesn't *have* to be tinked, the only remaining possibility from Premise 2 is that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
