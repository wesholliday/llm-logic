It could be nugged, but it's not a requirement.\n* **\"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked\"**: This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the shank doesn't *have* to be nugged, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the shank *is* plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
