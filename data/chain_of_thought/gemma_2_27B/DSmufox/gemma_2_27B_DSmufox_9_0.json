This means the twonk does *not* have to be plinked.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished. This presents two possibilities: the twonk is plinked, or it is varnished.\n\nSince we know the twonk doesn't *have* to be plinked (Premise 1), the only remaining possibility from Premise 2 is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
