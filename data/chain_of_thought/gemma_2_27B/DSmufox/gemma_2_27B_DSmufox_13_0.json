It could be tragged, but it's not a requirement.\n* **\"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\"**: This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the glip doesn't *have* to be tragged, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the glip *is* slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
