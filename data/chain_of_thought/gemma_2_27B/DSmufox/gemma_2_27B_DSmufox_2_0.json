It could be bimmed, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **\"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped\"**: This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the wug doesn't *have* to be bimmed, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
