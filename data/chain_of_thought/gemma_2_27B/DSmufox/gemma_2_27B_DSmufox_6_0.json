This means the grommet doesn't *have* to be plopped.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This presents two possibilities: the grommet is plopped, or it's sploffed.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the grommet doesn't *have* to be plopped, the second premise forces the conclusion that the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
