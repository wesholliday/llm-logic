This means the wug might be garpled, or it might not be.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. This presents two possibilities: the wug is garpled, or the wug is sproinged.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the wug doesn't *have* to be garpled, and the second premise says it must be either garpled or sproinged, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
