It could be daggled, but it's not a requirement.\n\n* **\"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\"**: This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the sprocket doesn't *have* to be daggled, the second statement forces us to conclude that the sprocket *must* be cranked to satisfy the \"or\" condition.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
