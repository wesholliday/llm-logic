This means the smonk does *not* have to be plagged.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This is a classic \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the smonk doesn't *have* to be plagged, the second premise forces the conclusion that the smonk *must* be vreebled to satisfy the \"or\" condition.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
