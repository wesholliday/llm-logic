    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Apples, bananas, and oranges are the top-selling fruits.\n* **Premise 2:** Apples are likely to be the top seller, followed by bananas, with oranges far behind.\n* **Premise 3:** If bananas aren't the top seller, and apples aren't the top seller, then oranges will be.\n* **Premise 4:** It's likely apples will be the top seller, meaning bananas won't be.\n\nThe argument concludes that if apples aren't the top seller, then oranges will be.\n\nThe reasoning is valid. If we accept the premises as true, then the conclusion logically follows. If apples are not the top seller (which is unlikely but possible), and bananas are also not the top seller (as implied by Premise 4), then the only remaining option among the top-selling fruits is oranges.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
