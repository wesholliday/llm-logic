    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

However, if they don't win, the only other options are the Warriors or the Celtics. We know the Warriors are less likely to win than the Lakers. Therefore, if the Lakers don't win, it becomes more likely that the Celtics will win.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
