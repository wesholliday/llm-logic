    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

This is because those three seasons are the only significant ones for travel.\n\nThe argument also states that spring is likely to have the most travelers, implying summer likely won't.\n\nTherefore, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, the only other option among the top travel seasons is winter.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
