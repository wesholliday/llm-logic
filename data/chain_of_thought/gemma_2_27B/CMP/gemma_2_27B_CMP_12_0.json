    "user_prompt": "Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

We know thrillers are likely to be #1.\n2. If thrillers aren't #1, then romances would be the next likely candidate.\n3. However, we're told romances likely won't be #1.\n4. This leaves mysteries as the only remaining option if thrillers aren't #1.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
