    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.
