    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Democrats are likely to gain the most voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing.\n* **Premise 2:** If Republicans don't gain the most voters, and Democrats don't gain the most voters, then Libertarians will.\n* **Premise 3:** Democrats are likely to gain the most voters, so Republicans likely won't.\n\nThe question asks if it follows that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.\n\nHere's the key:\n\nWe know Democrats are *likely* to gain the most, but it's not guaranteed.  Premise 3 tells us Republicans are *likely* not to gain the most because Democrats are likely to.\n\nSince there are only three parties, if Democrats don't win, and Republicans don't win, then by process of elimination, Libertarians must win.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
