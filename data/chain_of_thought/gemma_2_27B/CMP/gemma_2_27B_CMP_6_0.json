    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Taylor Swift is projected to sell the most, followed by Bad Bunny, with Beyonce far behind.\n* **Premise 2:** If Bad Bunny doesn't sell the most, and Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, then Beyonce will.\n* **Premise 3:** Taylor Swift is likely to sell the most, meaning it's unlikely Bad Bunny will.\n\nWe need to determine if it's likely that if Taylor Swift *doesn't* sell the most, Beyonce *will*.\n\nSince Taylor Swift is likely to sell the most, it's more probable that Bad Bunny won't sell the most. This scenario aligns with Premise 2, which states that if Bad Bunny doesn't sell the most and Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, then Beyonce will.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that if Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, Beyonce will.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
