    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

We know a minimum wage hike is the most likely scenario.\n2. If the minimum wage hike happens, the other two options are ruled out (only one law can pass).\n3. Since a minimum wage hike is likely, paid family leave is unlikely.\n4. This leaves us with the scenario where a minimum wage hike *doesn't* happen.\n5. In this scenario, Premise 3 tells us that loan forgiveness *will* happen.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
