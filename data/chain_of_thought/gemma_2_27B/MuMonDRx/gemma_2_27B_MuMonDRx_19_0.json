The new statement introduces an additional condition: \"in grazzle\". This condition is not mentioned in the original statement, and there's no logical connection between being \"blimp zibble\" and being \"in grazzle\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grooble must be \"in grazzle or blimp zibble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
