Frazzle for snorkel quork (whatever that means) \n2. Wozzle on quork\n\nThe original statement doesn't give us any information about \"frazzle for snorkel quork\".  It only tells us about \"wozzle on quork\".  Therefore, we can't infer the truth of the proposed statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
