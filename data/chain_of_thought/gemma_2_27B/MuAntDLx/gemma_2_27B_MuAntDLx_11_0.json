The flonk is flim.\n\nSince these are presented as alternatives connected by \"or\", it means that at least one of them must be true.  We don't know if the flonk is *both* grooble and flim, but we do know it must be at least one of those things.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flonk must be grooble.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
