If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement. It states that *if* the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, *then* the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) is also true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is true (Lisa did buy the red shirt), we can logically conclude that the second part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
