Here's why:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Alex finished the race.\n* **Premise 2:** If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a *modus ponens* argument in logic.  Modus ponens states that if we know:\n\n1.  If P, then Q\n2.  P\n\nThen we can conclude Q.\n\nIn our case:\n\n1. P = Alex finished the race\n2. Q = Chris finished the race\n\nSince we know both premises are true, we can logically conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
