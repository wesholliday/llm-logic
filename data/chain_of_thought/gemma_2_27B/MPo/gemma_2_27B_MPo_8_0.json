If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nThe structure of these premises matches the form of a valid syllogism:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* P is true.\n* Therefore, Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The vampire was awake.\n* Q = The mummy was awake.\n\nSince both premises are true, and the structure is valid, we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
