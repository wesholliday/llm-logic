We have two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** The book was written by James.\n2. **Premise 2:** If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThese premises fit the structure of a *modus ponens* argument:\n\n* If P, then Q\n* P\n* Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The book was written by James.\n* Q = The book is a mystery novel.\n\nSince both premises are true, we can logically conclude that the conclusion (Q) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
