We have two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Sam took a plane.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nThe structure of the second premise is a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\").  \n\nSince we know Premise 1 (P) is true, and Premise 2 states that Q (Erin took a train) is true *if* P is true, we can logically conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
