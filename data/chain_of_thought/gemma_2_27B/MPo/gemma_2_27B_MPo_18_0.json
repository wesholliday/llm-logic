We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The doll was plastic.\n* **Premise 2:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nSince the first premise confirms the condition stated in the second premise (the doll being plastic), we can logically conclude the consequent of the second premise, which is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
