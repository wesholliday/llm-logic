We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Jeff played basketball.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThe structure of Premise 2 is a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\").  To infer the conclusion (Q) from a conditional statement, we need the antecedent (P) to be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us that Jeff played basketball (P is true), and Premise 2 states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, we can logically conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
