This means there's a possibility the watch is charging there, but it's not a requirement.  The phrase \"might not be\" implies a possibility of the watch not being on the dresser. Since the original statement doesn't rule out the watch being on the dresser, it leaves open the possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
