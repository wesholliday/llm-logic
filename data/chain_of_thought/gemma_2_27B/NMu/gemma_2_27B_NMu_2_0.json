This leaves open the possibility that the griffin was or was not in the forest.  The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" means there's a possibility the griffin wasn't there. Since the original statement doesn't rule out this possibility, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
