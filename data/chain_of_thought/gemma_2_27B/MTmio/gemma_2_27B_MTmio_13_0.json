This means it's possible the truck was blue, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This sets up a conditional relationship: the redness of the car guarantees the blueness of the truck.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The car was not red\".  \n\nSince the truck *might not* have been blue, it means the condition required for the car to be red (the truck being blue) might not have been met. Therefore, it's possible the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
