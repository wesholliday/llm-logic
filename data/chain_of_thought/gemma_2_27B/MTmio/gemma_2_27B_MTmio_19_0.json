This means it's possible Jen watched basketball, but it's also possible she didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This sets up a conditional relationship: Tom watching football guarantees Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n*  Since Jen *might not* have watched basketball, it means the condition in Premise 2 might not be true. \n* If the condition (Tom watching football) isn't necessarily true, we can't definitively say Tom didn't watch football.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
