This means the banana could be yellow or not yellow.\n* **Premise 2:** If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This sets up a conditional relationship: the redness of the apple guarantees the yellowness of the banana.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nSince the banana *might not* be yellow, and the second premise states the banana *must* be yellow if the apple is red, this means the apple cannot be red. If it were red, the banana would have to be yellow, contradicting the first premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
