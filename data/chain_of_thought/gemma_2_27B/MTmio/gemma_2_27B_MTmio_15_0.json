This means it's possible Erin took a train, but it's also possible she didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This sets up a conditional relationship: Sam taking a plane directly implies Erin taking a train.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nSince Erin might not have taken a train (Premise 1), and Sam taking a plane would *require* Erin to have taken a train (Premise 2), we can infer that Sam likely did not take a plane. If Sam had taken a plane, it would contradict the possibility that Erin didn't take a train.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
