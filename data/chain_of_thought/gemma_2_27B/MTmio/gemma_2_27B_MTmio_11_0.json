This means it's possible the muffins were blueberry, but it's also possible they weren't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This sets up a conditional relationship: the truth of the cake being chocolate guarantees the truth of the muffins being blueberry.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\n*  Since the muffins *might not* have been blueberry, it means the condition in Premise 2 might not be true. \n* If the condition in Premise 2 is not true, then the \"if\" part (the cake being chocolate) could be either true or false. We don't have enough information to determine the truth value of \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: no \n",
