This means the mummy could be awake or asleep.\n* **Premise 2:** If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't say the vampire being awake *causes* the mummy to be awake, just that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nSince the mummy *might* not be awake, and the vampire being awake *requires* the mummy to be awake, we can infer that the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
