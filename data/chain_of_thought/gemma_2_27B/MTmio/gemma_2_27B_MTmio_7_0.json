This means it's possible Chris finished, but it's also possible he didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *didn't* finish.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude that Alex didn't finish.  \n\nSince Premise 1 only says Chris *might* not have finished, and Premise 2 only talks about what happens if Alex *does* finish, we can't definitively say Alex didn't finish.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
