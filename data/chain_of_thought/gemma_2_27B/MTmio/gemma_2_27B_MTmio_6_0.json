This means there's a possibility Bob chose something else.\n* **Premise 2:** If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This sets up a conditional relationship: Sue's choice of pizza directly leads to Bob choosing pasta.\n\nSince we know Bob *might not* have chosen pasta, and the only way he *would* choose pasta is if Sue chose pizza, we can infer that Sue likely did *not* choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
