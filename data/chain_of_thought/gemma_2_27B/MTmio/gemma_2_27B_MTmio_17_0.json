This means it's possible Kate ate salad, but it's also possible she didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This sets up a conditional relationship: Ben eating pasta guarantees Kate ate salad.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nSince Kate might not have eaten salad, and we know that Ben eating pasta would *force* Kate to have eaten salad, the only way for Kate to *possibly* not have eaten salad is if Ben *didn't* eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
