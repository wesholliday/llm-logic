            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means it's possible he bought it, but it's also possible he didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This sets up a conditional relationship: Lisa buying the red shirt guarantees Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nSince Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, and Lisa buying the red shirt would *force* Mark to buy the blue shirt, the only way for Mark to *not* have the blue shirt is if Lisa *didn't* buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
