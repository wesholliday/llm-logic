This means it's possible Amy played tennis, but it's also possible she didn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This sets up a conditional relationship: Jeff playing basketball guarantees Amy played tennis.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nSince Amy might not have played tennis, and Jeff playing basketball would *require* Amy to have played tennis, it means Jeff couldn't have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
