This means it's possible Sue was at the wedding, but it's also possible she wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This sets up a conditional relationship: Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that Mary was *not* at the wedding.\n\nSince Sue's presence is uncertain (Premise 1), and Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence (Premise 2), the only way for Premise 1 to be true is if Mary was *not* at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
