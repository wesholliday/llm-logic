This means it's possible the cat was inside.\n* **Premise 2:** If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nNotice that Premise 1 tells us the cat *might* have been inside.  If the cat was inside, then according to Premise 2, the dog *must* have been outside.  Since we know the cat *might* have been inside, we can't definitively say the dog was *not* inside.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
