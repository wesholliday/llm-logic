This means it's possible the unicorn was in the forest, but it's also possible it wasn't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This sets up a conditional relationship: the griffin's presence *requires* the unicorn's presence.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude that the griffin was *not* in the forest.\n\nSince the unicorn might not have been in the forest, and the griffin's presence depends on the unicorn's presence, it's possible the griffin wasn't in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
