This means there's a possibility the pants were denim, but also a possibility they weren't.\n* **Premise 2:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This sets up a conditional relationship: the shirt being cotton *guarantees* the pants are denim.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nSince the pants *might not* be denim, and the second premise says they *must* be denim if the shirt is cotton, the only way for the first premise to be true is if the shirt is *not* cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
