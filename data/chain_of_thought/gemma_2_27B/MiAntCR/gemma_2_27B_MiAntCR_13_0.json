It simply means there's a possibility subtitles are provided for the movie, regardless of its original language. Subtitles are often used for movies in languages other than the viewer's native language, but they can also be used for movies in the viewer's native language for accessibility reasons (e.g., for people who are deaf or hard of hearing).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
