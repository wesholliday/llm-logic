This implies a situation where careful preparation is mutually exclusive with simply being prepared.  \n\nIf we flip the original statement and change the \"then\" to \"if\", we are asking: \"If the meal was prepared carefully, does that mean it was not prepared?\"  \n\nSince the original statement establishes that careful preparation prevents a meal from simply being prepared, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
