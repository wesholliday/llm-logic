This is a conditional statement, meaning \"If A, then B\".  \n\nWe can represent this symbolically as:\n\n* A: The customer was served.\n* B: The customer was not served promptly.\n\nThe original statement is A \u2192 B.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer the reverse:\n\n* If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n\nThis would be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\nHowever, just because one thing implies another doesn't mean the reverse is also true. For example, if it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). But if the ground is wet (B), it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining (A) - it could be wet for other reasons.\n\nSimilarly, just because being served implies not being served promptly doesn't mean being served promptly implies not being served.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
