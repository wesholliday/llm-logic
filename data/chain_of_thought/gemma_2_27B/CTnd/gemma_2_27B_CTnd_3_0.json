It doesn't say anything about what happens if you eat a large meal.  \n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **Original statement:**  \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. It could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, just because eating a meal means you didn't eat a large meal, it doesn't mean that eating a large meal means you didn't eat a meal.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
