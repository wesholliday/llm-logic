It says that if the first part (the smip was shripped) is true, then the second part (the smip lupped the zoint) *must* also be true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the smip *might not* have lupped the zoint.  Statement 2 tells us that if the smip *was* shripped, it *would have* lupped the zoint. Since we know the smip might *not* have lupped the zoint, this means the smip might *not* have been shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
