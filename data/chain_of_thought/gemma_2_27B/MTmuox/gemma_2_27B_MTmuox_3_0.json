It's not a definite requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the splat was morphed, then quanking is a necessary consequence.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us quanking isn't a guaranteed event.  Statement 2 tells us that if the splat was morphed, quanking *would* happen. Since quanking isn't guaranteed, the splat couldn't have been morphed (otherwise, quanking would be guaranteed).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
