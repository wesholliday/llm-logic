It says that fraggling implies smoogling.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nSince the first statement says the zinger *might not* have been smoogled, and the second statement says that fraggling *leads to* smoogling, we can't definitively say the zinger wasn't fraggled. There's a possibility it was fraggled but somehow wasn't smoogled, contradicting the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
