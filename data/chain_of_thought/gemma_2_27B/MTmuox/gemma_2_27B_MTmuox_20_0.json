It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the first part (the fleeg being bluttered) is true, then the second part (the fleeg being surned) must also be true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the fleeg might not have been surned.  Statement 2 tells us that if it *was* bluttered, it *would* have been surned. Since we know it might not have been surned, the only way this works is if the fleeg wasn't bluttered in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
