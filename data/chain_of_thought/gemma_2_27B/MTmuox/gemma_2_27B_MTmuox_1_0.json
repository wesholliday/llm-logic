It says that if the flugel was blimmed, then zargling is a necessary consequence.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the flugel might not have been zargled, and Statement 2 says zargling is a result of blimmed, the only way for Statement 1 to be true is if the flugel wasn't blimmed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
