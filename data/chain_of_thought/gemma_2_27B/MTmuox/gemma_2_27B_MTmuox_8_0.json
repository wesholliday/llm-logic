It's not a certainty either way.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that cranking the sprocket *always* leads to the sprocket being daggled.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us the sprocket might not have been daggled, and the second statement says daggling is a guaranteed result of cranking, the only way for the first statement to be true is if the sprocket wasn't cranked in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
