It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that snurgling *implies* crinking. If the fribble was snurgled, then crinking is guaranteed.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us crinking might not have happened, and Statement 2 tells us snurgling *causes* crinking, the only way for Statement 1 to be true is if the fribble wasn't snurgled in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
