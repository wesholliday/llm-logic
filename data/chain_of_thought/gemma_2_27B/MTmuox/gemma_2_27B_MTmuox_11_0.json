It tells us that if the first part (the flug was blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug must have been zimmed) is also true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the flug *might not* have been zimmed.  Statement 2 tells us that if it *was* blummed, it *must* have been zimmed. Since we know it might not have been zimmed, the only way this works is if the flug was not blummed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
