It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the first part (the shank was plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank must have been nugged) is also true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the shank *might not* have been nugged.  Statement 2 tells us that if it *was* plooked, it *must* have been nugged. Since we know it might not have been nugged, and the only way it could be nugged according to Statement 2 is if it was plooked, we can infer that it was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
