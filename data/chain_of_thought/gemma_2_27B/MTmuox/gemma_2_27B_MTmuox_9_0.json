It tells us that plinking the twonk *guarantees* it's varnished.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nSince the first statement says the twonk *might not* be varnished, and the second statement says plinking *always* leads to varnishing, the only way for the first statement to be true is if the twonk wasn't plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
