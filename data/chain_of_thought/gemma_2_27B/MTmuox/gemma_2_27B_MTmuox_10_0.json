It tells us that sproinging implies garpling.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nSince the first statement says the wug *might* have been garpled, it doesn't rule out the possibility that it was sproinged (because sproinging leads to garpling).  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
