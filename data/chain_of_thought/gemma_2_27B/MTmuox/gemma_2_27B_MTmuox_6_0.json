It says that if the first part (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the second part (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the grommet *might not* have plopped the frink, and Statement 2 says plopping the frink is a *necessary* result of the grommet being sploffed, we can infer that the grommet couldn't have been sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
