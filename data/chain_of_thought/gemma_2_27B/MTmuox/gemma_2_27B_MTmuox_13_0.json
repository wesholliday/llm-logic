It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the first part (the glip was slogged) is true, then the second part (the glip must have tragged) is also true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the glip *might not* have tragged.  Statement 2 tells us that if the glip *was* slogged, it *must* have tragged. Since we know the glip might not have tragged, and it must have tragged if it was slogged, we can conclude the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
