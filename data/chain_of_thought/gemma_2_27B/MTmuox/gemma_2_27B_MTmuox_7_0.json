It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle must have tinked) is also true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the whiffle *might not* have tinked.  Statement 2 tells us that if the whiffle *was* shanked, it *must* have tinked. Since we know the whiffle might not have tinked, and shanking would *force* it to have tinked, we can conclude the whiffle couldn't have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
