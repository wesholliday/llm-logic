It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the clug being fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug being snugged) must also be true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 doesn't rule out the possibility of the clug being snugged.  Even if the clug was snugged, it doesn't automatically mean it was fleeked. Statement 2 only tells us what happens *if* it was fleeked.\n\nSince Statement 1 leaves open the possibility of the clug being snugged, and Statement 2 only provides information about a conditional relationship, we cannot definitively say the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
