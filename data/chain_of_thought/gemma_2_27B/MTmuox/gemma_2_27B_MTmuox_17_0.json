It's not a definite statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the first part (the flob being skizzled) is true, then the second part (the flob must have movated) is also true.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the flob *might not* have movated, and Statement 2 says that if the flob *was* skizzled it *must* have movated, the only way for Statement 1 to be true is if the flob was *not* skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
