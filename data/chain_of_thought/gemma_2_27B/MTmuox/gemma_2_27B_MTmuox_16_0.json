It's not a definite yes.\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that IF the sneg was crampled, THEN it definitely sproted the frink.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 doesn't rule out the possibility of the sneg sproting the frink.  Statement 2 only tells us what happens IF the sneg was crampled. Since Statement 1 leaves open the possibility of the sneg sproting the frink without being crampled, we can't definitively say the sneg wasn't crampled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
