It doesn't say the smonk *was* vreebled, only that *if* it was, then it *must* have plagged.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the smonk might not have plagged, and Statement 2 says plagging is a *result* of being vreebled, we can't definitively say the smonk wasn't vreebled. It's possible the smonk was vreebled but didn't plagg for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
