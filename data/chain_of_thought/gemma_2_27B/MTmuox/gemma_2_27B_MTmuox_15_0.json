It tells us that vroombing the dreb *guarantees* that it was also spened.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the dreb might not have been spened, and Statement 2 tells us that vroombing leads to spening, the only way for Statement 1 to be true is if the dreb was *not* vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
