Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* **P:** Sue chose pizza.\n* **Q:** Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe first premise states \"If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob must have chosen pasta (Q).\" The second premise states \"Bob might not have chosen pasta (Not Q).\"  This aligns with the structure of modus tollens.\n\nSince the premises fit the structure of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid argument form, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
