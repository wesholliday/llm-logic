Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* **P:** Tom watched football.\n* **Q:** Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n* If Tom watched football (P), then Jen must have watched basketball (Q).\n* Jen might not have watched basketball (Not Q).\n* Therefore, Tom did not watch football (Not P).\n\nSince the premises follow the structure of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid argument form, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
