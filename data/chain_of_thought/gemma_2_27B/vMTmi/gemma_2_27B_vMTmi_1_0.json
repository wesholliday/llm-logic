            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means it's possible Sue was not at the wedding.\n* **Conclusion:** Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThis argument structure resembles a form called *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is valid and follows this pattern:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nHowever, our second premise (\"Sue might not have been at the wedding\") is weaker than \"Not Q\". It only says Sue *might* not have been there, not that she definitely wasn't.\n\nBecause the second premise doesn't definitively rule out Sue being at the wedding, we can't definitively conclude that Mary wasn't there.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
