Not Q. Therefore, not P.\"\n\n* **Why it's invalid:**  Just because Kate might not have eaten salad (not Q) doesn't automatically mean Ben didn't eat pasta (not P). There could be other reasons why Kate didn't eat salad. The first premise only states what happens if Ben ate pasta, not what happens if he didn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
