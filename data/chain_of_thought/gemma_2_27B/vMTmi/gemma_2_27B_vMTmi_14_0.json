Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this pattern:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's analyze the given argument:\n\n* **P:** The bear was in the cave.\n* **Q:** The wolf was in the den.\n\nThe first premise states \"If P, then Q,\" which aligns with modus tollens. The second premise states \"Not Q\" (the wolf might not have been in the den), which also fits the pattern.\n\nHowever, the second premise uses the phrase \"might not have been.\" This introduces a possibility, not a certainty. Modus tollens requires a definitive \"not Q,\" not a potential \"not Q.\"\n\nBecause the second premise is not a definitive negation of Q, the argument does not strictly follow the valid modus tollens form.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
