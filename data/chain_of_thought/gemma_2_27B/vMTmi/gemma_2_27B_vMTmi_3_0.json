Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\n* **P:** The book was written by James.\n* **Q:** The book must be a mystery novel.\n\nThe first premise states \"If P, then Q,\" and the second premise states \"Not Q\" (since the book might not be a mystery novel, it's not necessarily true that it is).  Therefore, following the structure of modus tollens, the conclusion \"Not P\" (the book was not written by James) is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
