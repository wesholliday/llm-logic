            "content": "Explanation: This argument uses a conditional statement (\"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\") and its negation to draw a conclusion.  \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If P (doll is plastic), then Q (truck is metal).\n* **Premise 2:** Not necessarily Q (truck might not be metal).\n* **Conclusion:** Not P (doll is not plastic).\n\nThis follows the form of *modus tollens*, a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nIn this case, if the truck might not be metal (the consequent is false), then the doll couldn't have been plastic (the antecedent must be false).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
