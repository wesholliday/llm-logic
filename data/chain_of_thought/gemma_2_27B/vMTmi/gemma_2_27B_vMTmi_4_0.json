Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\n* **P:** The alien visited Mars.\n* **Q:** The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n* If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot must have visited Jupiter (Q).\n* The robot might not have visited Jupiter (Not Q).\n* Therefore, the alien did not visit Mars (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
