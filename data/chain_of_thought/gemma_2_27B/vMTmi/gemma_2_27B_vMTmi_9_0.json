Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\n* **P:** Lisa bought the red shirt.\n* **Q:** Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe first premise states \"If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Q).\" The second premise states \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (Not Q).\"  \n\nSince the second premise negates the consequent (Q) of the first premise, modus tollens allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P), which is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
