            "content": "Explanation: This argument is an example of a fallacy called denying the antecedent.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The structure:** The argument follows the form \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\"\n\n* **Why it's invalid:**  Just because the pants might not have been denim (not Q) doesn't automatically mean the shirt wasn't cotton (not P). There could be other reasons why the pants aren't denim. The original statement only says that *if* the shirt was cotton, *then* the pants would be denim. It doesn't say that denim pants are the *only* possibility if the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
