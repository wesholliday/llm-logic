Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given argument:\n\n* **P:** The cake was chocolate.\n* **Q:** The muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n* If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins must have been blueberry (Q).\n* The muffins might not have been blueberry (Not Q).\n* Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (Not P).\n\nSince the second premise states that the muffins *might not* have been blueberry, it doesn't definitively say they *weren't* blueberry. This means the second premise doesn't satisfy the requirement of \"Not Q\" in the modus tollens structure.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
