However, this doesn't automatically mean that P is also true. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nDoes this mean it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
