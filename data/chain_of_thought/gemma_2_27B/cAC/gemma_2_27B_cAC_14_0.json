We have a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This doesn't automatically mean that if the wolf is in the den, the bear must be in the cave.  The wolf could be in the den for other reasons.\n\nThe second statement, \"The wolf was in the den,\" only confirms the consequent of the conditional statement. It doesn't provide enough information to confirm the antecedent (the bear being in the cave).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
