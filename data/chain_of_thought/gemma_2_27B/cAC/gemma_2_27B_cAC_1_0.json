We have a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding. We also know that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true.  \n\nHowever, just because Sue was at the wedding doesn't automatically mean Mary was there too. It's possible Sue attended for a different reason. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
