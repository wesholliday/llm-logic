It doesn't say that the dog *being* inside *causes* the cat to be outside, just that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.\n\nThe second premise tells us the cat is outside. This *satisfies* the condition in the first premise, but it doesn't automatically mean the dog *must* be inside. There could be other reasons why the cat is outside.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nThe ground is wet.\n\nDoes it mean it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
