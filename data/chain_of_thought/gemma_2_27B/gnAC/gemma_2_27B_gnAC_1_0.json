            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument. We're given a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue being at the wedding *depends* on Mary being at the wedding. We're also told that Sue *was* at the wedding.  \n\nHowever, the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Sue is at the wedding but Mary isn't. It's possible Sue could have been there for another reason.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
