The original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be represented as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q \n\nWhere:\n* P = Joe went to the park\n* Q = Lucy went to the zoo\n\nWe know Q is true (Lucy went to the zoo). However, this doesn't automatically mean P is also true.  \n\nThink of it this way: the original statement only tells us what happens *if* Joe goes to the park. It doesn't say that Joe *must* go to the park for Lucy to go to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
