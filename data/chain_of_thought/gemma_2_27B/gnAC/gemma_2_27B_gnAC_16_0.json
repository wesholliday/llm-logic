While the consequent being true is a *necessary* condition for the antecedent (P) to be true, it's not *sufficient*.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* The pants being denim could be true for reasons other than the shirt being cotton. Maybe the pants are always denim, regardless of the shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was cotton just because the pants are denim.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
