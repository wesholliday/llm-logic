It doesn't say anything about what happens if Q is true. Q could be true for reasons unrelated to P.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n\"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. If we see the ground is wet, it *could* be because it rained, but it could also be because someone watered the lawn.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
