The conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" means that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob will definitely choose pasta. However, it doesn't say anything about what Bob will choose if Sue doesn't choose pizza.\n\nJust because Bob chose pasta doesn't automatically mean Sue chose pizza.
