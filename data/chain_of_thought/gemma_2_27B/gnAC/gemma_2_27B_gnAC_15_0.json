(This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\")\n* **Premise 2:** Erin took a train. (This is the consequent of the conditional statement)\n\nWe know that the consequent (Erin took a train) is true. However, this doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is also true.\n\nThink of it this way: the conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* Sam took a plane. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sam *didn't* take a plane. Erin could have taken a train for a completely different reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
