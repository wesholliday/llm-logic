It says that *if* the doll is plastic, *then* the truck is metal.  The second premise tells us the truck *is* metal.\n\nHowever, just because the truck is metal doesn't automatically mean the doll *must* be plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* The rule \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\" is true.\n* If the ground is wet, does it *always* mean it's raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, the truck being metal doesn't guarantee the doll is plastic.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
