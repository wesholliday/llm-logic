The original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" can be represented as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q \n\nWhere:\n* P = Ben ate pasta\n* Q = Kate ate salad\n\nWe know Q is true (Kate ate salad). However, the conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* P is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if P is false.\n\nIt's possible Ben ate pasta (P is true), and therefore Kate ate salad (Q is true). But it's also possible Ben didn't eat pasta (P is false), and Kate ate salad for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
