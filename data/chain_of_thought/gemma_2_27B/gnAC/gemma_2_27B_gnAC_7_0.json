C could be true for reasons unrelated to A.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* Maybe Chris finished the race because he's a really fast runner. This has nothing to do with whether Alex finished or not.\n\nTherefore, knowing that Chris finished the race doesn't automatically mean Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
