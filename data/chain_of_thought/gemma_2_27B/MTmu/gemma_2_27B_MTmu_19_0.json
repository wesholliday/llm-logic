(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P).\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = Tom watched football\n* Q = Jen must have watched basketball\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (Jen must not have watched basketball), we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\" (Tom did not watch football).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
