This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This negates the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire could not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
