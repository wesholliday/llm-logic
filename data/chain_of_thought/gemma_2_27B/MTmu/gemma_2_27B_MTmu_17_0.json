(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P).\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = Ben ate pasta\n* Q = Kate must have eaten the salad\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (Kate must not have eaten the salad), we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\" (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
