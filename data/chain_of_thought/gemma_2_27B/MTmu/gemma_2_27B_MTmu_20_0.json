(This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* If the antecedent (apple was red) were true, then the consequent (banana must have been yellow) would also have to be true.\n* Since we know the consequent is false (banana must not have been yellow), the antecedent (apple was red) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
