(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a tool called a truth table to see if we can validly conclude \"Sam did not take a plane\" (Not P) from these premises.\n\nHere's how the truth table would look:\n\n| P (Sam took a plane) | Q (Erin took a train) | If P, then Q | Not Q |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True | False |\n| True | False | False | True |\n| False | True | True | False |\n| False | False | True | True |\n\nLooking at the table, the only scenario where \"Not Q\" (Erin did not have to take a train) is true is when P is false (Sam did not take a plane) or when Q is false (Erin did not take a train).\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" is true, we can conclude that P must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
