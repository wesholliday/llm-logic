This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This negates the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.  \n\nTherefore, if Amy did not have to play tennis, then Jeff could not have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
