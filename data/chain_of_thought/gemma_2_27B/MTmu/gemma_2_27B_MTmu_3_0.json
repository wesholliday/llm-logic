(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement, meaning  'not Q')\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to draw a conclusion. Modus tollens states:\n\nIf If P, then Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nApplying this to our premises:\n\n* If the book was written by James (P), then the book must be a mystery novel (Q).\n* The book is not a mystery novel (not Q).\n* Therefore, the book was not written by James (not P).\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
