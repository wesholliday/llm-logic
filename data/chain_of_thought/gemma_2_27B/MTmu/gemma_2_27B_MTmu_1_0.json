This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This negates the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false to maintain the truth of the entire statement.\n\nTherefore, if Sue must not have been at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
