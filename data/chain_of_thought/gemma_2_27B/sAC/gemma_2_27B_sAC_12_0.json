The conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" doesn't tell us anything definitive about Joe's actions. It only tells us what happens *if* Joe goes to the park.\n\nSince Lucy went to the zoo, it could be because Joe went to the park, or it could be for some other reason entirely. We don't have enough information to conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
