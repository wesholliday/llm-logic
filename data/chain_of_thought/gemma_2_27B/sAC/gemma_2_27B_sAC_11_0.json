While the consequent being true might suggest the antecedent (P) is also true, it doesn't necessarily have to be.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **P:** The cake was chocolate.\n* **Q:** The muffins were blueberry.\n\nPremise 1 tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. Premise 2 tells us that Q is indeed true. However, there could be other reasons why Q is true besides P being true.\n\nFor example, maybe the muffins were blueberry because they were made with a special blueberry recipe, regardless of the cake's flavor.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
