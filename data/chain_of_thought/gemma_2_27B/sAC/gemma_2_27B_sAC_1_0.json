We're given a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding. We're also told that Sue was at the wedding.  \n\nHowever, the conditional statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary isn't at the wedding. Sue could be at the wedding for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
