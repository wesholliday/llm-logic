If the first premise is true (meaning that Chris finishing the race *depends* on Alex finishing the race), and the second premise is true (Chris *did* finish the race), then we can logically conclude that the first part of the conditional statement must also be true (Alex *must have* finished the race).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
