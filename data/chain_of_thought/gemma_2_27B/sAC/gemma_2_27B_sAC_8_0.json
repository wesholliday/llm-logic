The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q \n\nWhere:\n* P = The vampire was awake\n* Q = The mummy was awake\n\nWe are given that Q is true (The mummy was awake).  \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (P) is also true. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake.\n\nHowever, if the antecedent (P) were false (the vampire was not awake), then the conditional statement would be false. Since the conditional statement is true, and the consequent is true, the antecedent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
