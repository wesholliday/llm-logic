The conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" doesn't guarantee that Sue chose pizza if Bob chose pasta. It only tells us what happens if Sue *did* choose pizza.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* The statement is true if Sue chose pizza AND Bob chose pasta.\n* The statement is also true if Sue didn't choose pizza, regardless of what Bob chose.\n\nSince we only know Bob chose pasta, we can't definitively say Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
