The conditional statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" doesn't tell us anything definitive about the bear's location if the wolf is in the den. It only tells us what happens if the bear *is* in the cave.\n\nThe wolf being in the den could be due to other reasons unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
