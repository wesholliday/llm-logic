We're given a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This doesn't automatically mean the dog *was* inside, just that if it *was*, then the cat *must* be outside. We're also told \"The cat was outside\" is true.  \n\nWhile the cat being outside is consistent with the dog being inside, it doesn't prove the dog was inside. There could be other reasons for the cat to be outside.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
