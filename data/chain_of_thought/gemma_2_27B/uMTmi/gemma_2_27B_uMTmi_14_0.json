It means that the presence of the bear in the cave guarantees the presence of the wolf in the den.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\" This statement tells us that the wolf's presence in the den is not certain.\n\nSince the wolf might not have been in the den, and the first statement says the wolf *must* be in the den if the bear is in the cave, we can conclude that the bear cannot be in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
