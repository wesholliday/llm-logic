It means that if the first part (shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (pants being denim) *must* also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Also, the pants might not have been denim.\" This statement tells us that the pants being denim is not a certainty.\n\nSince the pants might not have been denim, it means the first part of the conditional statement (shirt being cotton) cannot be true. If the shirt was cotton, the pants would *have* to be denim according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
