It doesn't say Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, only that *if* she did, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. **Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.** This means there's a possibility Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\nSince the first statement is conditional, and the second statement tells us the condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) might not be true, we can't definitively say Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
