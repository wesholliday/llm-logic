It means that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain.\n\nSince Sue's presence is uncertain, and Mary's presence is tied to Sue's, we cannot definitively say that Mary was not at the wedding. It's possible Mary was there, and Sue was not, but it's also possible neither of them were there.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
