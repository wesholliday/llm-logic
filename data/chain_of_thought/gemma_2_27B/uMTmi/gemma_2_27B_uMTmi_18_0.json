It means that the doll being plastic *guarantees* the truck is metal.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Also, the truck might not have been metal.\" This tells us there's a possibility the truck is *not* metal.\n\n* **The Question:** \"Can we infer that the doll was not plastic?\"\n\nSince the truck *might* not be metal, it means the condition set in Statement 1 might not be true.  If the condition (doll being plastic) is not required for the truck to be metal, then the doll could be plastic or not plastic. We don't have enough information to say for sure.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
