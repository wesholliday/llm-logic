It means that the presence of the griffin *guarantees* the presence of the unicorn.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\" This statement tells us the unicorn's presence is uncertain.\n\nSince the unicorn's presence is uncertain, and the griffin's presence *requires* the unicorn's presence, we can conclude that the griffin likely wasn't in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
