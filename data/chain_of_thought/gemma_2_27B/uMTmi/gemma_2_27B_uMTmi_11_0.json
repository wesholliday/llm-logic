It means that if the first part (cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (muffins being blueberry) *must* also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Also, the muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This tells us that the muffins being blueberry is not a certainty.\n\nSince the muffins might not have been blueberry, and we know that if the cake was chocolate, the muffins *must* be blueberry, we can conclude that the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
