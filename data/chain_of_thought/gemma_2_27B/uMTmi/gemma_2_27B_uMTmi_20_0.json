It means that the redness of the apple *guarantees* the yellowness of the banana.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Also, the banana might not have been yellow.\" This tells us that the banana's color is not necessarily yellow. It could be yellow, but it could also be another color.\n\n* **The Question:** \"Can we infer that the apple was not red?\"\n\nSince the banana *might not* be yellow, and the first statement says the banana *must* be yellow if the apple is red, we can conclude that the apple could not have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
