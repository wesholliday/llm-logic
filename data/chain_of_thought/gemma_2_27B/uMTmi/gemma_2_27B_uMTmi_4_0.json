This sets up a conditional relationship: Alien visiting Mars implies Robot visiting Jupiter.\n* **Statement 2:** The robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means it's possible the robot did *not* visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, consider the logic:\n\nIf the alien visited Mars, the robot *must* visit Jupiter. But we know the robot *might not* have visited Jupiter. This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the initial condition (the alien visiting Mars) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
