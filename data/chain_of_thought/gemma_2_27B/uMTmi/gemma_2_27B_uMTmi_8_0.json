It means that the vampire being awake is a *sufficient* condition for the mummy being awake.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This statement tells us the mummy's state is uncertain.\n\nNow, we need to see if we can conclude the vampire wasn't awake.\n\nSince the mummy *might not* have been awake, it doesn't automatically mean the vampire *wasn't* awake.  The vampire could have been awake, but something else prevented the mummy from waking up.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
