But if the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining. It could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, just because a red car implies a blue truck, it doesn't mean a blue truck implies a red car. There could be other reasons for the truck to be blue.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
