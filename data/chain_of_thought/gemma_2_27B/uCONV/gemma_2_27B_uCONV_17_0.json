Just because one event follows another doesn't mean the reverse is also true. \n\nFor example, if it rains, the ground gets wet. But if the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it rained. It could have been watered, or there could be a leak.\n\nSimilarly, even though Ben eating pasta leads to Kate eating salad, it doesn't mean that Kate eating salad *must* have been caused by Ben eating pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
