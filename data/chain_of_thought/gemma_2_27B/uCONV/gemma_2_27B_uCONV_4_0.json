Just because one event happens after another doesn't mean the first event *caused* the second.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it rains, the ground gets wet. \n* Does that mean if the ground is wet, it must have rained? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, even if the alien visiting Mars leads to the robot visiting Jupiter, it doesn't mean the robot visiting Jupiter *requires* the alien to have visited Mars. There could be other reasons for the robot to go to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
