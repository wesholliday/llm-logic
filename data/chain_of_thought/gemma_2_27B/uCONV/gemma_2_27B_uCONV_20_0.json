Just because one thing implies another, doesn't mean the reverse is also true. \n\nFor example, if it's raining, the ground is wet. But if the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining (it could be from sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, even if a red apple implies a yellow banana, a yellow banana doesn't necessarily imply a red apple. There could be yellow bananas that aren't associated with red apples.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
