Just because one event follows another doesn't mean the reverse is also true. \n\nFor example, if it rains, the ground gets wet. But if the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it rained. It could have been watered, or there could be a leak.\n\nSimilarly, even if Sue choosing pizza leads to Bob choosing pasta, it doesn't mean that Bob choosing pasta *always* means Sue chose pizza. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
