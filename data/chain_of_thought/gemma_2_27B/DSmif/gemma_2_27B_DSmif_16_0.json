This is a statement of exclusivity - the pen can only be in one of these two places.\n* **Premise 2:** The pen might not be on my desk. This means it's possible the pen is not on the desk.\n\nSince the pen must be in one of the two locations, and it might not be on the desk, the only remaining possibility is that it is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
