This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. This means the first possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the newspaper can't be on the porch (according to Premise 2), and Premise 1 states it must be in one of the two locations, the only remaining possibility is the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
