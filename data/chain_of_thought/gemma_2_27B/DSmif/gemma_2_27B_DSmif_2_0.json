This means at least one of the possibilities must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This statement tells us that it's possible the book is *not* on the table.\n\nSince Statement 2 leaves open the possibility that the book is not on the table, and Statement 1 says one of the two options *must* be true, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
