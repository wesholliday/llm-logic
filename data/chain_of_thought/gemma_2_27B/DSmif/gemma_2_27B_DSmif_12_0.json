This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This tells us the first possibility from Premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince the jacket can't be in the closet (according to Premise 2), and the first premise states it must be one or the other, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
