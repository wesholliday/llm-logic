The conditional statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". The consequent, \"the wolf was in the den\", is given as true.  \n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent, \"the bear was in the cave\", is also true. It's possible for the consequent to be true for reasons unrelated to the antecedent.\n\nFor example, maybe the wolf went to the den for a reason completely independent of the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
