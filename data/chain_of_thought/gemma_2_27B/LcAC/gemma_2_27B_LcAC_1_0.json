            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\n* The second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" tells us that Q is true.\n\n*  However, knowing that Q is true doesn't automatically mean that P is also true. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding for a reason unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
