It doesn't say that Mary's presence is the *only* reason Sue is at the wedding, just that if Mary is there, Sue is also there.\n\n* **The conclusion** tries to reverse this logic. It says that if Mary is *not* at the wedding, then Sue *must also* not be there. This doesn't necessarily follow. There could be other reasons why Sue would be at the wedding even if Mary isn't.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean if it's not raining, the ground must be dry? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
