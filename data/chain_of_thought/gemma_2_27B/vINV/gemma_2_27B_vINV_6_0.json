It doesn't say anything about what happens when Sue *doesn't* choose pizza.\n\n* **The conclusion** claims that if Sue *didn't* choose pizza, then Bob *couldn't* have chosen pasta. This is too strong of a claim. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, even if Sue didn't choose pizza.\n\nFor example, maybe Bob always chooses pasta, regardless of what Sue chooses.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
