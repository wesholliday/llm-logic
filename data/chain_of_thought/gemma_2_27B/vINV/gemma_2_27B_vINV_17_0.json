It doesn't say that Ben eating pasta is the *only* reason Kate eats salad, just that if he does, she will too.\n\n* **The conclusion** tries to flip this around. It says that if Ben *didn't* eat pasta, then Kate *couldn't* have eaten salad. This is too strong of a claim. There could be many other reasons why Kate might eat salad, regardless of whether Ben eats pasta.\n\nBecause the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
