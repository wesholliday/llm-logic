It doesn't say that taking a plane *causes* Erin to take a train, just that if Sam takes a plane, Erin taking a train is also true.\n\n* **The conclusion** tries to reverse this logic. It says that if Sam *didn't* take a plane, then Erin *couldn't* have taken a train. This isn't necessarily true. There could be other reasons why Erin might take a train, regardless of Sam's travel choices.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nDoes that mean if it's *not* raining, the ground *can't* be wet? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
