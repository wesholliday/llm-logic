It leaves open the possibility that the dreb was or was not vroombed.  \n\nThe statement \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" means that there's a possibility the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the dreb not being vroombed, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
