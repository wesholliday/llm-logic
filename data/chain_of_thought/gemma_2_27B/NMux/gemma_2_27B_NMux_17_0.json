This leaves open the possibility that the flob was or was not skizzled.  \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" means there's a possibility the flob wasn't skizzled. Since the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the flob not being skizzled, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
