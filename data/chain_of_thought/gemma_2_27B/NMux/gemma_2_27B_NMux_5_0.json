This leaves open the possibility that the zinger was or was not fraggled.  \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" simply means there's a possibility the zinger wasn't fraggled. Since the original statement doesn't rule out this possibility, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
