It leaves open the possibility that the smip was or was not shripped.  \n\nThe statement \"The smip might not have been shripped\" means there's a possibility the smip wasn't shripped.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the smip not being shripped, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
