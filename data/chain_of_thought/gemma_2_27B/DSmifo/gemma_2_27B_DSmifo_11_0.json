This means it's possible the newspaper is *not* on the porch.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway. This is a statement of exclusivity - the newspaper can only be in one of these two places.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the newspaper *might not* be on the porch, and the second premise says it *must* be either on the porch or in the driveway, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
