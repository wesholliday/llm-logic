This means it's possible the milk is not in the fridge.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. This sets up two exclusive possibilities: the milk is in the fridge, or it's on the counter.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the milk *might not* be in the fridge, and Premise 2 says it *must* be either in the fridge or on the counter, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
