This means it's possible the phone is not in the kitchen.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. This sets up two possibilities: the phone is in the kitchen and ringing, or it's in the living room.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the phone might *not* be in the kitchen, and Premise 2 says it must be in *one* of those two locations, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
