This means it's possible the book is on the table, but it's also possible it's not.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This presents two exclusive options: the book is on the table, or it's on the shelf.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the book might *not* be on the table, and the second premise says it *must* be either on the table or the shelf, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
