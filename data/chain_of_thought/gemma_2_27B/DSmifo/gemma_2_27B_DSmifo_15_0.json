This means it's possible they are not by the door.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet. This sets up two exclusive possibilities.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the shoes *might not* be by the door, and the second premise says they *must* be either by the door or in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
