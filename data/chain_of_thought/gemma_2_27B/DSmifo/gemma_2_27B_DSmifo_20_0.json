This means it's possible they are not on her head.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag. This presents two exclusive possibilities.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the sunglasses *might not* be on her head, and the second premise states they *must* be either on her head or in her bag, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
