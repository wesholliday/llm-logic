This means it's possible the umbrella is *not* in the closet.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. This presents two possibilities: the umbrella is in the closet, or it's in the car.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the umbrella *might not* be in the closet, and the second premise says it must be *either* in the closet *or* the car, we can conclude that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
