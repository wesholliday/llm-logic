This means it's possible the pen is not on the desk.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag. This presents two possibilities, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the pen might *not* be on the desk, the second premise forces us to conclude that the pen *must* be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
