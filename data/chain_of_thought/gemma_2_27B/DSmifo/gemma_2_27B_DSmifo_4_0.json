This means it's possible the cat is playing in the bedroom, but it's also possible it's not.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. This sets up an \"or\" situation, meaning one of these options must be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the cat *might not* be playing in the bedroom, and the second premise says one of the two options *must* be true, we can conclude the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
