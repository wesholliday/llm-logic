This means it's possible the remote is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. This presents two exclusive options.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the remote *might not* be under the couch, and the second premise says it *must* be in one of those two locations, the only remaining possibility is that the remote is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
