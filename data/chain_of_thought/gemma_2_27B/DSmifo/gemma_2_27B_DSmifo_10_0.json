This means it's possible the sock is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. This presents two exclusive options.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the sock *might not* be under the bed, and the second premise says it *must* be in one of those two locations, the only remaining possibility is the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
