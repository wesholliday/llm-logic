This means it's possible the notebook is somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. This presents two exclusive options: the notebook is in one of these locations.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the notebook might *not* be on the nightstand, and the second premise says it must be in *one* of the two locations, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
