We are given two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. **Premise 2:** The bear was in the cave.\n\nThe structure of these premises allows us to draw a conclusion. Since the first premise establishes a conditional relationship (If A, then B), and the second premise confirms that A is true (the bear was in the cave), we can logically conclude that B must also be true (the wolf was in the den).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
