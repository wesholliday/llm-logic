We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.** This is a conditional statement.\n2. **Lisa bought the red shirt.** This is a factual statement.\n\nSince the first premise states that *if* Lisa buys the red shirt, *then* Mark buys the blue shirt, and we know Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, we can logically conclude that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
