We are given two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. **Premise 2:** The book was written by James.\n\nThe structure of these premises allows us to draw a conclusion. Since the first premise establishes a condition (written by James) and its result (mystery novel), and the second premise confirms that the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the result must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
