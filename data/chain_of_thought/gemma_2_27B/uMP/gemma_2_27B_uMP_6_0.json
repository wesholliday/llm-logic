We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.** This is a conditional statement.\n2. **Sue chose pizza.** This is a factual statement.\n\nSince the first premise states that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta, and we know Sue did choose pizza, we can logically conclude that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
