We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.** This sets up a conditional relationship.\n2. **The doll was plastic.** This confirms the condition stated in the first premise.\n\nSince the condition (doll being plastic) is true, the conclusion (truck being metal) must also be true according to the first premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
