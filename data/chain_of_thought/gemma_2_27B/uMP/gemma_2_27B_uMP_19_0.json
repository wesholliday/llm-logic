            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical syllogism. We are given two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. **Premise 2:** Tom watched football.\n\nThe structure of these premises follows a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the affirmation of the antecedent (P).  In logic, this structure allows us to conclude the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Tom watched football.\n* Q: Jen watched basketball.\n\nSince we know Tom watched football (P is true), and the first premise states that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball, we can logically conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
