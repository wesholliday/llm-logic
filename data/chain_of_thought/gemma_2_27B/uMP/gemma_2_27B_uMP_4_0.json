We have two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. **Premise 2:** The alien visited Mars.\n\nThe structure of these premises matches the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and its antecedent (P).  Since we know the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, we can logically conclude the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
