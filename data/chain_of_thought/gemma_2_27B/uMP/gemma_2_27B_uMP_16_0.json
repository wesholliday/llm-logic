We are given two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. **Premise 2:** The shirt was cotton.\n\nThe structure of these premises follows a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and an affirmation of the antecedent (P).  In logic, this structure allows us to conclude the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The shirt was cotton.\n* Q: The pants were denim.\n\nSince we know the shirt was cotton (P is true), we can infer that the pants were denim (Q is also true).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
