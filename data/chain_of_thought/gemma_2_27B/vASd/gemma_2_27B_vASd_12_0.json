Here's why:\n\n* **The premise only states a condition for playing video games:** Finishing homework.\n* **The conclusion adds an extra, unrelated condition:** The computer catching on fire.\n\nThe fact that the computer might catch on fire doesn't change the original condition for playing video games. Even if the computer catches fire, if you finish your homework, the premise still holds true. The conclusion is unnecessarily restrictive.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
