Here's why:\n\nIf the premise is true (getting enough sleep prevents tiredness), then even if you add another condition (doing hard labor), it doesn't negate the original premise.  The conclusion simply states that under a more specific set of circumstances (enough sleep AND hard labor), you still won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
