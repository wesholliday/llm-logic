This doesn't necessarily follow.\n\nThe premise only states that being in the garage guarantees safety. It doesn't say anything about what happens if additional factors, like flooding, are introduced. Flooding could easily make the car unsafe, even if it's inside the garage.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
