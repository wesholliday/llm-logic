This is a general statement about the relationship between charging and power.\n* **Conclusion:** If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power. This is a more specific statement that adds the condition of a dead battery.\n\nThe conclusion is logically valid because it's a more specific case of the premise. If charging a phone leads to power in general, then charging a phone with a dead battery would definitely lead to power. The added condition of a dead battery doesn't contradict the premise; it simply narrows down the scope.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
