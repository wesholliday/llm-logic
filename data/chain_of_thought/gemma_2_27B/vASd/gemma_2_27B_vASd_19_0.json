Here's why:\n\n* **The premise establishes a necessary condition:** The premise states that a full gas tank is necessary for the car to run. It doesn't say it's the *only* condition.\n* **The conclusion adds an irrelevant condition:** The conclusion introduces a new condition (a hole in the gas tank) that would directly contradict the premise. Even if the gas tank is full, a hole would prevent the car from running.\n\nThe conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise because the added condition makes the conclusion false, even if the premise is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
