Here's why:\n\n* **The premise only guarantees lighting under normal circumstances.** It states that striking a match *will* lead to it lighting.\n* **The conclusion introduces a new condition: being soaked in water.** Soaking a match in water would likely prevent it from lighting, even if struck.\n\nThe conclusion tries to combine the premise with a contradictory condition.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
