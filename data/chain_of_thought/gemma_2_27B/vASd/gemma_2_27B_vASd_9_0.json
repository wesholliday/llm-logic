However, the premise only states that a well-written essay guarantees an A. It says nothing about essays that are both well-written and late. It's possible that turning in an essay late, even if it's well-written, could result in a penalty.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
