The premise only states that if the dog is in the yard, it's barking. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the dog is in the yard *and* asleep. It's entirely possible for a dog to be in the yard and asleep without barking.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
