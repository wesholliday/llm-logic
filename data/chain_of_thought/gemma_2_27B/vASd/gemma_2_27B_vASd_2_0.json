Here's why:\n\n* **The premise only states that going to the concert leads to a good time.** It doesn't say anything about what happens if other events occur alongside going to the concert.\n* **The conclusion adds a new condition (a bomb going off) to the premise.**  The presence of a bomb would likely drastically change the experience, making it highly improbable to have a good time.\n\nThe conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
