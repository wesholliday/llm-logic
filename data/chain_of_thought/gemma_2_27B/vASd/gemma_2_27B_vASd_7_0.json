This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q), where P is \"the oven is on\" and Q is \"the kitchen is warm.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm. This is also a conditional statement (If R, then Q), where R is \"the oven is on and the pilot light is out.\"\n\nNotice that the conclusion's antecedent (R) is a more specific condition than the premise's antecedent (P).  If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the oven is definitely on.\n\nSince the conclusion requires a more specific condition to be true, and the premise already establishes that the kitchen is warm when the oven is on, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
