This can be represented as P \u2192 Q (where P = bill is paid, Q = services continue).\n* **Conclusion:** If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. This can be represented as (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q (where R = check bounces).\n\nThe argument essentially says that because paying the bill leads to continued services, then paying the bill even if the check bounces will also lead to continued services.\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily follow.  The premise only guarantees continued services when the bill is paid. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the payment method is faulty (like a bounced check).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
