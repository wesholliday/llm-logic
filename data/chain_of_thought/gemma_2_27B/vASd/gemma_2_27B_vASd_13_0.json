Here's why:\n\n* **The premise only states that exercise alone leads to weight loss.** It doesn't say anything about the effect of combining exercise with junk food.\n* **The conclusion introduces a new element (eating junk food) that wasn't present in the premise.**  \n\nJust because exercise can lead to weight loss doesn't automatically mean that exercise combined with an unhealthy diet will have the same result. In fact, it's likely that eating junk food would counteract the weight loss benefits of exercise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
