It tells us that if the first part (the shank was plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank was nugged) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the shank was not plooked), we can conclude that the second part (the shank was nugged) could be either true or false.  The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about the truth value of the second part when the first part is false.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
