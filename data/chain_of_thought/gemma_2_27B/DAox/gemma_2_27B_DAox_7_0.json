If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the whiffle was not shanked), we can conclude that the second part (the whiffle tinked) could be either true or false.  The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the first part is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
