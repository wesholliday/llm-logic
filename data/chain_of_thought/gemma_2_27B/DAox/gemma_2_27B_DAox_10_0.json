Here's how it breaks down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The wug was not sproinged.\n* **Premise 2:** If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nWe can see that the first premise directly contradicts the condition in the second premise. Since the wug wasn't sproinged, the consequence of it being garpled cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
