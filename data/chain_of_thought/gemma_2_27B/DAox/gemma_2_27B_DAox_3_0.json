It tells us that *if* a certain condition is met (the splat being morphed), *then* a certain consequence follows (the splat quanking).\n\nSince we know from Premise 1 that the splat was *not* morphed, the condition for the consequence in Premise 2 is not met.  Therefore, we can conclude that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
