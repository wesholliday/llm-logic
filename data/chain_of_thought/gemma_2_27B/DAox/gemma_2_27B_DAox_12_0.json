Here's how to break it down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The smip was not shripped.\n* **Premise 2:** If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nWe can see that the first premise directly contradicts the condition in the second premise. Since the smip was *not* shripped, the consequence of the second premise (the smip lupping the zoint) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
