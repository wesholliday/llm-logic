It tells us that if the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the sprocket was *not* cranked), we can conclude that the second part (the sprocket was daggled) could be either true or false.  The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
