If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the second part (the flob movated) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the flob was not skizzled), we cannot conclude anything about the second part (whether the flob movated or not).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
