Here's how it breaks down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The fleeg was not bluttered.\n* **Premise 2:** If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nModus tollens states that if we know a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and we know that P is false, then we can conclude that Q is also false.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The fleeg was bluttered.\n* Q: The fleeg surned.\n\nSince we know P is false (Premise 1), and we know \"If P, then Q\" is true (Premise 2), we can conclude that Q must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
