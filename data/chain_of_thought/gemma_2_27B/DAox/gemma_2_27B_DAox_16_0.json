It tells us that if the first part (the sneg being crampled) is true, then the second part (the sneg sproting the frink) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the sneg was *not* crampled), we can conclude that the second part (the sneg sproting the frink) could be either true or false. The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the sneg *is* crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
