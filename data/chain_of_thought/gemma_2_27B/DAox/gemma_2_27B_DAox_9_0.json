If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the second part (it was varnished) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the twonk was not plinked), we cannot conclude anything about whether the twonk was varnished or not. The second part of the conditional statement only applies if the first part is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
