If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the zinger was fraggled) is true, then the second part (the zinger was smoogled) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the zinger was not fraggled), we cannot conclude anything about the second part (whether the zinger was smoogled or not).\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nIf it's not raining, we can't say for sure if the ground is wet or dry. It could be wet for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
