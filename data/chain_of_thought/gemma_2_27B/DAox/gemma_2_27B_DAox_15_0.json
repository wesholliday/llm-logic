If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the second part (the dreb was spened) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the dreb was not vroombed), we cannot conclude anything about the second part (whether the dreb was spened or not).\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nWe know it's not raining, so we can't say for sure if the ground is wet or dry. It could be wet for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
