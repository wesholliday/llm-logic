If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement. It tells us that *if* the wug was flooped, *then* it bimmed the zoint. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the wug *wasn't* flooped.\n\nSince we know the wug did not floop (premise 1), we can conclude that the condition in the second premise is false.  \n\nBecause the condition is false, the entire conditional statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the wug bimming the zoint).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
