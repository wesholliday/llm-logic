It tells us that *if* the fribble was snurgled, *then* it would have crinkled.  \n\nSince we know the fribble was *not* snurgled (from the first statement), we can conclude that the condition for the second statement was not met.  Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether or not the fribble crinkled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
