If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the flug was blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the flug was not blummed), we cannot conclude anything about the second part (whether the flug was zimmed or not).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
