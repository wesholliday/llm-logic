It tells us that if the first part (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the second part (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement is false (the flugel was not blimmed), we cannot conclude anything about the second part. The flugel could be zargled or not zargled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
