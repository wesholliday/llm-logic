Since the dog was *not* inside, the consequence of Premise 2 (the cat being outside) doesn't necessarily follow.\n\nThink of it like this: Premise 2 sets up a rule, but Premise 1 tells us the rule doesn't apply in this situation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
