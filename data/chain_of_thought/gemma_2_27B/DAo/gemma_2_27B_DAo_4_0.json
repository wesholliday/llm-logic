It doesn't say the robot *did* visit Jupiter, only that if the alien visited Mars, *then* the robot would have visited Jupiter.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the alien *didn't* visit Mars, the condition for the robot visiting Jupiter is not met.  Therefore, we cannot conclude that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
