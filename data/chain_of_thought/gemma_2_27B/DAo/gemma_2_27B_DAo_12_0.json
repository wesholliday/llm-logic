It doesn't say that Lucy *only* goes to the zoo if Joe goes to the park, just that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy going to the zoo is a guaranteed consequence.\n\nSince we know Joe did *not* go to the park, the condition for Lucy going to the zoo is not met.  Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lucy did or did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
