Here's how it breaks down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Mary was not at the wedding.\n* **Premise 2:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nModus tollens states that if we know a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and we know that P is false, then we can conclude that Q is also false.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding.\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nSince we know P is false (Mary was not at the wedding), and we know \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, we can conclude that Q (Sue was at the wedding) is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
