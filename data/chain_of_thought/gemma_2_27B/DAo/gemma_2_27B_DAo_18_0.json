It tells us that *if* the doll was plastic, *then* the truck would be metal.  \n\nSince we know the doll was *not* plastic, the condition for the second statement is false. This means the second statement doesn't tell us anything about the truck. The truck could be metal or it could be made of something else.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
