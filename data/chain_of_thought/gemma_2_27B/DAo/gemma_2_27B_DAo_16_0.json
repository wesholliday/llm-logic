If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that the pants being denim is *dependent* on the shirt being cotton. Since the first statement tells us the shirt is *not* cotton, the condition for the pants being denim is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the pants are not denim. It's possible the pants are denim for reasons unrelated to the shirt's material.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
