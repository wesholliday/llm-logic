It tells us what happens *if* the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true.  \n\nSince we know Sue *didn't* choose pizza (Premise 1), the condition for the second premise is false. This means we can't conclude anything about Bob's choice. The second premise doesn't apply in this situation.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
