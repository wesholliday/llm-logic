It tells us that Sam taking a plane is a *sufficient* condition for Erin taking a train.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sam *doesn't* take a plane.\n\nSince Sam didn't take a plane (Premise 1), we can't conclude anything definite about Erin taking the train.  Erin might have taken the train for other reasons, or maybe Erin didn't take the train at all.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
