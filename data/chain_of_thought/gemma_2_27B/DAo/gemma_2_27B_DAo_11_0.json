If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that *if* the cake was chocolate, *then* the muffins would be blueberry.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake is *not* chocolate.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the cake was not chocolate, the condition in the second statement is false.  \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is only false when the first part (the hypothesis) is true and the second part (the conclusion) is false. Since the hypothesis is false in this case, the entire conditional statement is considered true, regardless of whether the muffins are blueberry or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
