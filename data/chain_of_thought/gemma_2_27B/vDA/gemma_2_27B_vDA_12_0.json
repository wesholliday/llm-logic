Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = Joe went to the park.\n* Q = Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as the first premise states a conditional statement, the second premise negates the antecedent (Joe going to the park), and the conclusion negates the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
