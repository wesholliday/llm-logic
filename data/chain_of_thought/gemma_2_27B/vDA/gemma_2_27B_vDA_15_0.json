Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane.\n* Q: Erin took a train.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q). It then states that Sam did not take a plane (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that Erin did not take a train (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
