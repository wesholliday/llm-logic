Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Lisa bought the red shirt.\n* Q: Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q). It then states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
