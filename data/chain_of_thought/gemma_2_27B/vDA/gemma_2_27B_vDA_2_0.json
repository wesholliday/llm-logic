Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as the first premise states a conditional relationship, the second premise negates the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest), and the conclusion negates the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
