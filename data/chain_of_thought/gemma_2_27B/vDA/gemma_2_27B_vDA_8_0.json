Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake.\n* Q: The mummy was awake.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q). It then states that the vampire was not awake (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that the mummy was not awake (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
