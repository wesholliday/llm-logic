Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The alien visited Mars.\n* Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q). It then states that the alien did not visit Mars (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that the robot did not visit Jupiter (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
