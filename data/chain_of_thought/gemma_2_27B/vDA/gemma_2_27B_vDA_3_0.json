Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The book was written by James.\n* Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe argument correctly applies the structure of modus tollens, as it states that if the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel, and then states that the book was not written by James. Therefore, it logically concludes that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
