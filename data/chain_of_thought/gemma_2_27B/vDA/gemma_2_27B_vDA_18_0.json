Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The doll was plastic.\n* Q: The truck was metal.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the doll was plastic (P), then the truck was metal (Q). It then states that the doll was not plastic (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that the truck was not metal (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
