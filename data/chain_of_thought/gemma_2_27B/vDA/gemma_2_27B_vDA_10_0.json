Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The dog was inside.\n* Q: The cat was outside.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the dog was inside (P), then the cat was outside (Q). It then states that the dog was not inside (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that the cat was not outside (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
