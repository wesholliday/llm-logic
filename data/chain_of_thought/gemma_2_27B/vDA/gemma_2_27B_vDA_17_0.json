Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Ben ate pasta.\n* Q: Kate ate salad.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (Q), and it also states that Ben did not eat pasta (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that Kate did not eat salad (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
