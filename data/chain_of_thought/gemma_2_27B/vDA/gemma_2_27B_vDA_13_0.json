Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The car was red.\n* Q: The truck was blue.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the car was red (P), then the truck would be blue (Q). It then states that the car was not red (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that the truck is not blue (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
