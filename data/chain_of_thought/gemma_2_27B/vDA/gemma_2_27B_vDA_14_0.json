Modus tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave.\n* Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\nThe argument correctly applies modus tollens because it states that if the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q). It then states that the bear was not in the cave (not P). Therefore, it logically follows that the wolf was not in the den (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
