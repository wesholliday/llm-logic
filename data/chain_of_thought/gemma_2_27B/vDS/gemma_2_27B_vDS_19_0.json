A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\"\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The watch is charging on the dresser,\" which is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
