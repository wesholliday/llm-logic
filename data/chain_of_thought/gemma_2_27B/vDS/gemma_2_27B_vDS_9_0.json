A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (it can't be both in the box and blending on the floor at the same time), eliminating one possibility logically leads to the conclusion that the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
