A disjunctive syllogism has the following structure:\n\n* Either P or Q\n* Not P\n* Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = The book is on the shelf\n* Q = The book is resting on the table\n\nThe argument follows the structure of a disjunctive syllogism because it presents two possibilities (the book is on the shelf or the book is on the table), eliminates one possibility (the book isn't on the table), and concludes with the remaining possibility (the book is on the shelf).\n\nDisjunctive syllogisms are a valid form of argument. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
