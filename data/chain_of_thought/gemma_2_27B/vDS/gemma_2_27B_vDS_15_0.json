A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\"\n* Therefore, the conclusion logically follows: \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the valid structure of a disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
