A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two mutually exclusive options (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of the options, leading to the conclusion that the remaining option must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one option: \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive, if one is false, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
