A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\"\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The sunglasses are in her bag,\" which is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
