A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two mutually exclusive options (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of the options, leading to the conclusion that the remaining option must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Presents the disjunction: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\"\n* **Premise 2:** Eliminates one option: \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive (the toy cannot be in both places at the same time), eliminating one option logically leads to the conclusion that the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
