A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two alternative possibilities (a disjunction) and then eliminates one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The first premise presents the disjunction: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\"\n* The second premise eliminates one possibility: \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n* Therefore, the conclusion logically follows: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nSince the argument structure follows the valid pattern of a disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
