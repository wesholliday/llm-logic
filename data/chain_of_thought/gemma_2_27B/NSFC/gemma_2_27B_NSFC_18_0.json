These possibilities are presented as alternatives connected by \"or\".  \n\nWhen we say \"A or B\", it means that at least one of the options is true. It doesn't exclude the possibility that both A and B could be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the project might be completed early and the project might be completed late.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
