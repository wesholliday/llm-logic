This doesn't necessarily mean the package *must* arrive on one of those days, but it suggests those are the only options.  \n\nThe statement \"The package might arrive on Monday and the package might arrive on Tuesday\" implies that both arrivals are possible simultaneously. This isn't necessarily true based on the original statement. The package can't arrive on both days at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
