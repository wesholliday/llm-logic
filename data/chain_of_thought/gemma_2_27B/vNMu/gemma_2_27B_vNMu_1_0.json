Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" means it's possible Mary was not at the wedding.\n* **Conclusion:** \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\"  means it's possible Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise.
