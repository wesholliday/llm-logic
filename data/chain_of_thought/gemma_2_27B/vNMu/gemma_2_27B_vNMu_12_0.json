Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" means there's at least one possibility where the jacket is *not* draped over the chair.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" simply states that it's possible the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n\nSince the premise already establishes the possibility of the jacket not being draped over the chair, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
