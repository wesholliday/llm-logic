Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" means there's at least one possibility where the vampire wasn't awake.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The vampire might not have been awake\"  means there's a possibility the vampire wasn't awake.\n\nSince the premise already establishes the possibility of the vampire not being awake, the conclusion logically follows. The conclusion is a weaker statement than the premise, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
