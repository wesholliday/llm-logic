Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" means it's possible the watch is charging there, but it's also possible it's not.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\"  simply states that it's possible the watch is not charging there.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise. If it's not certain the watch *must* be charging on the dresser, then it's certainly possible it's *not* charging there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
