Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" means there's a possibility the shoes are *not* in the closet.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The shoes might not be in the closet\"  directly states that possibility.\n\nSince the premise already establishes the possibility of the shoes not being in the closet, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
