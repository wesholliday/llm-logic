Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means there's a possibility the toy is *not* in the toy box.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The toy might not be in the toy box\"  directly states that possibility.\n\nSince the premise already establishes the possibility of the toy being elsewhere, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
