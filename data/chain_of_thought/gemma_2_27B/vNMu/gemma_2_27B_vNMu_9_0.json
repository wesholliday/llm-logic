Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" means it's possible Lisa bought the red shirt, but it's also possible she didn't.\n* **Conclusion:** \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\"  simply states that it's possible Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise. If it's not certain that Lisa bought the red shirt, then it's certainly possible she didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
