Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" means it's possible Jeff played basketball, but it's also possible he didn't.\n* **Conclusion:** \"Jeff might not have played basketball\"  simply states that it's possible Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nThe conclusion is a weaker statement than the premise. If it's possible Jeff didn't play basketball (as the premise states), then it's definitely true that he might not have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
