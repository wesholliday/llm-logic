Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" means it's possible the pen is somewhere else. It doesn't definitively say the pen *isn't* in the bag, just that it's not necessarily there.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The pen might not be in my bag\"  is a weaker statement than the premise. If it's possible the pen is not in the bag (as the premise states), then it logically follows that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\nThe conclusion doesn't contradict the premise; it's a less strong assertion derived from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
