Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" means there's at least a possibility the milk is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The milk might not be on the counter\"  simply states that possibility.\n\nSince the premise already establishes the possibility of the milk not being on the counter, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
