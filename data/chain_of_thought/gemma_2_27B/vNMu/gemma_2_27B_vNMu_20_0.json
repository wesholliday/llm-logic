Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" means it's possible the sunglasses are somewhere else.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\"  is a restatement of the premise. If it's not certain the sunglasses are in the bag, then it's possible they are not.\n\nSince the conclusion directly follows from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
