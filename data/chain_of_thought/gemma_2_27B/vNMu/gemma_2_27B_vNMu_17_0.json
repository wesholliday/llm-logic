Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\" This means there's at least one possibility where the scarf is *not* in the backpack.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\" This conclusion simply states that it's possible the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nSince the premise already establishes that the scarf doesn't *have* to be in the backpack, the conclusion that it *might not* be in the backpack logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
