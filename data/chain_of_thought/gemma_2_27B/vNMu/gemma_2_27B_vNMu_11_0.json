Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\" means the newspaper is not necessarily in the driveway. It could be there, or it could be somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\"  is a weaker statement than the premise. If the newspaper isn't necessarily in the driveway, then it certainly *might not* be there.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
