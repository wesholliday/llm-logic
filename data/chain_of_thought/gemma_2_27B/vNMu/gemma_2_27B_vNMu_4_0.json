Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" means it's possible the alien did *not* visit Mars.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The alien might not have visited Mars\"  means it's possible the alien did *not* visit Mars.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise. If it's not certain the alien visited Mars, then it's certainly possible they didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
