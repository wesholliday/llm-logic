Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means it's possible the griffin was somewhere else. It doesn't definitively say the griffin *wasn't* in the forest, just that it wasn't *required* to be there.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\"  means there's a possibility the griffin wasn't in the forest.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise. If it's not certain the griffin *had* to be in the forest, then it's certainly possible it wasn't.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
