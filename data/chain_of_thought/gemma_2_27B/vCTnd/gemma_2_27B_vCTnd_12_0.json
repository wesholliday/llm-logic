            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the argument and analyze its structure.\n\n* **Premise:** If Jane studied, then she did not study long. This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = Jane studied, Q = Jane studied long).\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Jane studied long, then she did not study. This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nOne way to test this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is equivalent to Q \u2192 \u00acP. Notice that this is exactly our conclusion!\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
