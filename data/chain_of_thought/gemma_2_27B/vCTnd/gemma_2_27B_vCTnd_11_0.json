            "content": "Explanation: This argument demonstrates a valid logical form known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order.  \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* If P, then not Q (If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables)\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n\n* If not Q, then not P (If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
