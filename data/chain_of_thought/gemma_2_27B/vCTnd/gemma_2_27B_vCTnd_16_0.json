This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = \"the job was completed\" and Q = \"the job was completed well\").\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the job was completed well, then it was not completed. This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use a truth table to examine all possible truth values for P and Q.\n\nIf we find a scenario where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 \u00acQ | Q \u2192 \u00acP |\n|---|---|-------|-------|\n| T | T | F      | F      |\n| T | F | T      | T      |\n| F | T | T      | F      |\n| F | F | T      | T      |\n\nLooking at the truth table, we see that when P is true and Q is true, the premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is false, while the conclusion (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is also false. This means there's a case where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
