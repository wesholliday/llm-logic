            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the argument and analyze its structure.\n\n* **Premise:** If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly. This can be represented symbolically as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = \"the room was tidied\" and Q = \"the room was tidied thoroughly\")\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. This can be represented as: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis argument structure resembles the contrapositive form. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nThe contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Notice that this matches the conclusion of our argument.\n\nTherefore, since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
