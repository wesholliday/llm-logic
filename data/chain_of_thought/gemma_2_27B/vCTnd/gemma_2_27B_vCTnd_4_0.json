            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently. This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = Ben studied, Q = Ben studied diligently).\n* **Conclusion:** If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study. This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion are actually contrapositives of each other. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both.  \n\nThe contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly our conclusion.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
