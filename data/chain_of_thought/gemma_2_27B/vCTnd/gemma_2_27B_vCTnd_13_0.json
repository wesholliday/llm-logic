This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = Alex exercised, Q = Alex exercised much).\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the premise states that if Alex exercised, he didn't exercise much. This doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Alex exercises *much*. It's possible for Alex to exercise much and still not have exercised in the broader sense (maybe he only exercised much today, but not on other days).\n\nTherefore, the premise doesn't provide enough information to guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
