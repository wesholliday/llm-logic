This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acC (where P stands for \"the meal was prepared\" and C stands for \"the meal was prepared carefully\").\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. This can be represented as C \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nOne way to test this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acC is \u00ac\u00acC \u2192 \u00acP, which is equivalent to C \u2192 \u00acP. Notice that this is exactly the same as our conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
