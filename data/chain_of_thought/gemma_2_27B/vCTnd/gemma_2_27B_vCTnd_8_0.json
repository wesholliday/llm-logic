This can be represented symbolically as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = \"the issue was addressed\" and Q = \"the issue was addressed effectively\")\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This can be represented as: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis argument structure resembles a type of logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent\" or \"inverse error\". This fallacy occurs when we assume that if a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) must also be true. However, this is not logically valid.\n\nIn our case, the premise tells us that if the issue was addressed, it wasn't addressed effectively. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the issue *was* addressed effectively.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
