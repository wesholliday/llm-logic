This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = Ann exercised, Q = Ann exercised strenuously).\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion are actually the contrapositives of each other. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
