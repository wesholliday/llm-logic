This can be represented symbolically as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = a recommendation was made, and Q = it was a strong recommendation).\n\n* **Conclusion:** If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. This can be represented as: Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use a truth table to examine all possible truth values for P and Q.\n\nIf the premise is true, and the conclusion is also true in *all* cases where the premise is true, then the argument is valid.\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 \u00acQ | Q \u2192 \u00acP |\n|---|---|-------|-------|\n| T | T | F      | F      |\n| T | F | T      | T      |\n| F | T | T      | F      |\n| F | F | T      | T      |\n\nLooking at the truth table, we see that there are cases where the premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is true, but the conclusion (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is false.  Specifically, when P is true and Q is true, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
