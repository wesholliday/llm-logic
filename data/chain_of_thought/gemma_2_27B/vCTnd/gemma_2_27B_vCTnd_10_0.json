Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Structure:** The argument uses a conditional statement structure.  \n\n* **Contrapositive:** The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Validity:** In logic, a contrapositive of a true statement is always true. If the premise is assumed to be true, then its contrapositive (the conclusion) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
