            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism. We have a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This means that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true. We are also given that \"The shirt was cotton,\" which satisfies the first part of the conditional statement.  \n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
