We have a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. We are also given the premise that \"The vampire was awake.\" Since the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can conclude that the second part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
