We have a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Mary being at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue being at the wedding. We are also given the premise that \"Mary was at the wedding.\" Since the condition for Sue being at the wedding is met, we can logically conclude that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
