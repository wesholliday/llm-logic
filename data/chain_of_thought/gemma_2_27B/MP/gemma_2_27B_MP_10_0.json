We have a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that the cat being outside is dependent on the dog being inside. We are also given the fact that \"The dog was inside.\" Since the condition for the cat being outside is met, we can logically conclude that the cat was indeed outside. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
