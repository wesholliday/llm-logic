We have a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true. We are also given the fact that \"Sue chose pizza.\" Since the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can conclude that the second part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
