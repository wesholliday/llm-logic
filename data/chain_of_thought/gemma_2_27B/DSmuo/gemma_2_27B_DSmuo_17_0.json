It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\" This presents two possibilities: the scarf is in the backpack, or it's on the coat rack.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the scarf doesn't *have* to be on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
