It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\" This presents two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, or it's in the closet.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the umbrella doesn't *have* to be in the closet, the second statement's \"or\" clause becomes irrelevant.  This leaves us with the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
