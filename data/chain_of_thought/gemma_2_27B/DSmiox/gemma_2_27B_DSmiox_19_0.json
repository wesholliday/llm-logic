This means it's possible the smonk is plagged, but it's also possible it isn't.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This sets up a situation where the smonk has to be one of two things: vreebled or plagged.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the smonk might *not* be plagged, and the second premise says it *must* be either vreebled or plagged, the only remaining option is that the smonk must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
