This doesn't tell us for sure if it's blummed or not.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" presents two possibilities: the flug is blummed, or if it's not blummed, then it must be zimmed.\n\nSince the first statement says the flug *might not* be zimmed, and the second statement says it *must* be zimmed if it's not blummed, we can conclude that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
