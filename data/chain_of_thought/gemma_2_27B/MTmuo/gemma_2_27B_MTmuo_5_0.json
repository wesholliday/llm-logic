It's not a definite statement about Amy's actions.\n\n* **\"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\"**: This is a conditional statement. It says that Amy playing tennis is a *consequence* of Jeff playing basketball. It doesn't say anything about whether Jeff actually played basketball.\n\nSince we know Amy might not have played tennis, and Amy playing tennis is dependent on Jeff playing basketball, we can conclude that Jeff likely did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
