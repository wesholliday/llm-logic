It doesn't say the shirt *was* cotton, only that *if* it was, then the pants would have to be denim.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us the pants weren't necessarily denim, it contradicts the second statement's consequence. This means the condition in the second statement (\"the shirt was cotton\") must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
