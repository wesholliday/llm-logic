It's not a definite statement about the unicorn's location.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement. It doesn't say the griffin *was* in the forest, but if it *was*, then the unicorn *must* have been too.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nSince the first statement says the unicorn *might not* have been in the forest, and the second statement says the unicorn *must* be in the forest *if* the griffin is, we can't definitively say the griffin wasn't in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
