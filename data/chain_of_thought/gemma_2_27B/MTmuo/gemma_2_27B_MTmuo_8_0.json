It's not a definite statement.\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that the mummy being awake is a *consequence* of the vampire being awake.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nSince the mummy *might* not have been awake (from Statement 1), and the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake (from Statement 2), we can deduce that the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
