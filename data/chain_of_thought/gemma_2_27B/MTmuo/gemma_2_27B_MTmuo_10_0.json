It doesn't say the dog *was* inside, only that *if* it was, then the cat would have been outside.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nNotice that Statement 1 tells us the cat *might* not have been outside.  If the cat wasn't outside, then Statement 2 wouldn't be true (because the condition \"if the dog was inside\" wouldn't lead to the cat being outside).\n\nTherefore, for Statement 2 to be true, the dog must have been outside.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
