It means that Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race. If Alex finished, then Chris *must* have also finished.\n\nNow, we know Chris didn't *have* to finish the race.  Since Chris finishing depends on Alex finishing, the only way for Chris to *not* have to finish is if Alex *didn't* finish.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
