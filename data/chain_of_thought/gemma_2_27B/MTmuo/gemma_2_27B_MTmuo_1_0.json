It means that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding. If Mary was there, Sue had to be there too.\n\nNow, we need to see if these statements lead to the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nSince we know Sue doesn't *have* to be at the wedding, and her presence is tied to Mary's, the only way for the first statement to be true is if Mary wasn't at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
