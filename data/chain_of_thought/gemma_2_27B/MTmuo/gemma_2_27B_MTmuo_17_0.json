It's not a definite statement about her meal.\n* **\"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\"**: This is a conditional statement. It says that Kate eating salad is a *consequence* of Ben eating pasta. It doesn't say anything about whether Ben actually ate pasta.\n\nSince we know Kate didn't *have* to eat salad, and we know that Ben eating pasta would *force* Kate to have eaten salad, we can conclude that Ben must not have eaten pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
