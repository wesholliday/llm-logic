            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This means the banana might have been yellow, but it's not a requirement.\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that the banana being yellow is a consequence of the apple being red.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us the banana doesn't *have* to be yellow, it means the condition in the second statement might not be true.  If the condition (apple being red) isn't true, then the consequence (banana being yellow) doesn't have to be true either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
