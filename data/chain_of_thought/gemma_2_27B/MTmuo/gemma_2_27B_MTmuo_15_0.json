It's not a definite statement about her mode of transportation.\n\n* **\"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\"**: This is a conditional statement. It says that Erin taking the train is a *consequence* of Sam taking a plane. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sam *didn't* take a plane.\n\nSince we know Erin might not have taken the train, and the second statement only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane, we can't definitively say whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
