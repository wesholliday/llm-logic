            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **\"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"**: This means Mark might have bought the blue shirt, but it's not a certainty.\n* **\"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"**: This is a conditional statement. It means that Mark buying the blue shirt is dependent on Lisa buying the red shirt. If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, we can't conclude anything about Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nSince we know Mark didn't *have* to buy the blue shirt, and his buying the blue shirt depends on Lisa buying the red shirt, the only way for the first statement to be true is if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
