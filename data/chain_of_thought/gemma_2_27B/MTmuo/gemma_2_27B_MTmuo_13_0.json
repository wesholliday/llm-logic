            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break this down using logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means the truck might have been blue, but it's not a necessity.\n* **Premise 2:** If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This sets up a conditional relationship: the car being red *requires* the truck to be blue.\n\nWe want to see if we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nSince the truck doesn't *have* to be blue (Premise 1), the condition in Premise 2 might not be met.  If the condition (car being red) isn't met, then the consequence (truck being blue) doesn't have to be true either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
