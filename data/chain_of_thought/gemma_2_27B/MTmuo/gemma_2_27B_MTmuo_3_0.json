This means the book might be a mystery novel, or it might not be.\n* **Premise 2:** If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This sets up a conditional relationship: James writing the book guarantees it's a mystery.\n\nWe want to see if we can conclude \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nSince the first premise tells us the book doesn't *have* to be a mystery, and the second premise says it *would* be a mystery if James wrote it, the only way for both premises to be true is if James didn't write the book.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
