It tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins *had* to be blueberry.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us the muffins weren't necessarily blueberry, it contradicts the second statement's condition.  If the cake *was* chocolate, the muffins *would have* to be blueberry, which we know isn't necessarily true. Therefore, the cake cannot have been chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
