            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means the wolf *might* have been in the den, but it's not a certainty.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement. It doesn't say the bear *was* in the cave, only that *if* it was, then the wolf would also be in the den.\n\nWe're asked if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the wolf *might not* have been in the den, and Statement 2 says the wolf *must* be in the den *if* the bear was in the cave, we can conclude that the bear likely wasn't in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
