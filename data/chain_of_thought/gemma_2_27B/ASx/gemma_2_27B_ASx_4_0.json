The new statement adds an extra condition: the zink must also be bazoogled. Since the original statement doesn't say anything about the relationship between being bazoogled and being tinking, we can't be sure if being bazoogled affects the tinking status. It's possible that a zink can be both bazoogled and tinking, but it's also possible that being bazoogled prevents something from being tinking.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
