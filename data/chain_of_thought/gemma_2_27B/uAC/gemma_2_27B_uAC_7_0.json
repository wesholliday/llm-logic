We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.** This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (Alex finishing) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing) must also be true.\n2. **Chris finished the race.** This is a factual statement.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that Alex finished the race.  Since we know Chris finished the race, and the first premise states that Chris finishing depends on Alex finishing, we can logically conclude that Alex must have also finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
