The wolf was in the den.\n\nThe argument structure is in the form of \"If P, then Q. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.\" This is called *modus ponens* and is a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nSince the wolf being in the den is true, and the first premise states that the wolf being in the den is a consequence of the bear being in the cave, we can logically conclude that the bear must have been in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
