We are given a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" We are also told that \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"  \n\nThis structure resembles the logical form of \"If P, then Q. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.\" This form is not always logically valid. Just because the consequence (Q) is true doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (P) is also true. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
