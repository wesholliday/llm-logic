We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.** (This is a conditional statement, implying that the mummy waking up is dependent on the vampire waking up.)\n2. **The mummy was awake.** (This is a factual statement.)\n\nSince the mummy is awake, and the first premise states that the mummy waking up depends on the vampire waking up, we can logically conclude that the vampire must also have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
