However, this doesn't automatically mean P is also true. There could be other reasons why the muffins are blueberry.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* The ground is wet (Q).\n\nDoes that mean it must be raining (P)? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
