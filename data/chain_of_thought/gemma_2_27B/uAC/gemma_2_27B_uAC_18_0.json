We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.** (This is a conditional statement)\n2. **The truck was metal.** (This is a factual statement)\n\nSince the truck is metal, and the first premise states that the truck being metal is a consequence of the doll being plastic, we can logically conclude that the doll must have been plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
