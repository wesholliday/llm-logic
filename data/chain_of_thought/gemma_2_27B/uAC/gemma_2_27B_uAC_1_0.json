            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument. We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.** (This is a conditional statement, implying that Sue's presence at the wedding depends on Mary's presence.)\n2. **Sue was at the wedding.** (This is a factual statement.)\n\nSince we know Sue was at the wedding, and the first premise states that Sue's presence is dependent on Mary's, we can logically conclude that Mary must have also been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
