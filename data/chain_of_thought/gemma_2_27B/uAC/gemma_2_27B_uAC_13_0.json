The truck was blue.\n\nThe argument structure is in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the consequent (Q) is true.  \n\nWe can't definitively say the car was red. While the truck being blue is a necessary condition for the car being red (according to the first premise), it's not a sufficient condition. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
