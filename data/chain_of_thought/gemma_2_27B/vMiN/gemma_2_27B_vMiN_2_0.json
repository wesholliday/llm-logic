This means it's possible the griffin was not there.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This means we cannot definitively say the griffin was in the forest.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the griffin's absence. The conclusion simply states that we can't claim the griffin's presence as a certainty.  Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
