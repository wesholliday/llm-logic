This means there's a possibility she didn't buy it.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. This means it's not necessarily true that she did buy it.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of Lisa not buying the shirt. The conclusion simply states that it's not certain she did buy it, which aligns with the premise.  There's no contradiction, and the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
