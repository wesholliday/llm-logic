This means there's a possibility Jeff didn't play basketball.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball. This means it's not necessarily true that Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe premise already allows for the possibility that Jeff didn't play basketball. Therefore, the conclusion, which states that it's not certain he played, logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
