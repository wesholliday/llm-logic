This means there's a possibility the author is someone other than James.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the book must have been written by James. This means we cannot definitively say James is the author.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the book being written by someone else.  Therefore, it logically follows that we cannot conclude the book *must* have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
