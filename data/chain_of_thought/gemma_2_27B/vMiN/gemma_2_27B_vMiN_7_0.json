Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Statements:**\n    * \"Alex might not have finished the race\" means there's a possibility Alex didn't finish.\n    * \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" means it's not certain Alex finished.\n\n* **Logical Connection:** If there's a possibility Alex didn't finish, then it cannot be definitively said that Alex *must* have finished. The premise allows for the possibility of Alex not finishing, which directly supports the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
