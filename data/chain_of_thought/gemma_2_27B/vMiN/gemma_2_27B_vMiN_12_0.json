This means it's possible the jacket is *not* draped over the chair.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair. This means the jacket is not necessarily draped over the chair.\n\nThe premise and conclusion are essentially saying the same thing: the jacket's presence on the chair is not guaranteed. If it's possible the jacket isn't there, then it can't be said that it *must* be there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
