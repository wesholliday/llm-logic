This means it's possible the alien did not visit Mars.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. This means it's not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nThe premise and conclusion are essentially saying the same thing in different ways. If it's possible the alien didn't visit Mars, then it can't be a requirement that they did.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
