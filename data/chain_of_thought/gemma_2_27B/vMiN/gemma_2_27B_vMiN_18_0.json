This means there's a possibility the notebook is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer. This means we cannot definitively say the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the notebook being elsewhere.  Therefore, it logically follows that we cannot claim it *must* be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
