This means it's possible the vampire was asleep.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake. This means it's not necessarily true that the vampire had to be awake.\n\nThe premise allows for the possibility that the vampire was not awake. The conclusion simply states that it's not a guaranteed fact that the vampire was awake.  Since the premise doesn't rule out the vampire being asleep, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
