This means there's a possibility the toy is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box. This means we cannot definitively say the toy is in the toy box.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the toy being elsewhere.  Therefore, the conclusion logically follows. If there's a chance the toy isn't in the box, we can't claim it *must* be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
