This means there's a possibility the watch is *not* charging there.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser. This means it's not absolutely certain the watch is charging there.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the watch not charging on the dresser.  Therefore, it logically follows that it cannot be definitively said that the watch *must* be charging there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
