This means there's a possibility they are not there.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag. This means it's not necessarily true that the sunglasses have to be in her bag.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the sunglasses being absent. The conclusion simply states that because of this possibility, they don't *have* to be in the bag.  The conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
