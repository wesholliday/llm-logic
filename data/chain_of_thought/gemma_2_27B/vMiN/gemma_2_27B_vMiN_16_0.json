Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** \"The pen might not be in my bag\" means there's a possibility the pen is not in the bag.\n* **Conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" means the pen is not necessarily in the bag.\n\nThe premise already states the possibility of the pen not being in the bag. The conclusion simply rephrases this by saying it's not certain the pen is in the bag. Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
