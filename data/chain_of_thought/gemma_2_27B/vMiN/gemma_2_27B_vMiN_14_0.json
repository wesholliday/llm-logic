This means there's a possibility the milk is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter. This means it's not necessarily true that the milk has to be on the counter.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of the milk being elsewhere.  Therefore, it logically follows that the milk doesn't *have* to be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
