This means it's possible Mary was not there.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. This means it's not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding.\n\nThe premise already establishes the possibility of Mary's absence.  The conclusion simply states that her presence is not a requirement. Since the premise allows for Mary's absence, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
