This means there's a possibility Sue chose something else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza. This means it's not necessarily true that Sue had to choose pizza; other options were possible.\n\nThe premise directly supports the conclusion. If there's a chance Sue didn't choose pizza, then it can't be said that she *must* have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
