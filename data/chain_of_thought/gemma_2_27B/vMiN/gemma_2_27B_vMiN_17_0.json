This means there's a possibility the scarf is *not* in the backpack.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack. This means the scarf is not necessarily in the backpack.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise. If there's a chance the scarf isn't in the backpack, then it can't be definitively said that it *must* be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
