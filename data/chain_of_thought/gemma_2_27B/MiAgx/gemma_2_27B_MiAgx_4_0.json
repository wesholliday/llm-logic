The gribble might be in the snork wozzle.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer a sentence that combines both possibilities. Since the original sentence uses \"might be\" for both possibilities, it indicates uncertainty about both locations.  Therefore, we can infer that both possibilities could be true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
