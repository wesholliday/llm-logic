Since both of these statements are presented with \"might\", they are presented as possibilities, not certainties.  Therefore, we can infer that it *might* be true that the frazzle is on the zump and the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble, as these are the possibilities presented in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
