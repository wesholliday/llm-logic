The snorkel is snizzle.\n\nThe phrasing \"might be\" indicates that these are not definite statements, but rather potential truths.\n\nThe inference \"It might be that the wump is quank and the snorkel is snizzle\" combines both possibilities into a single statement. Since both original possibilities are presented as potential truths, it's logically valid to suggest that they could both be true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
