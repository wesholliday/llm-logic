This means both of these statements are presented as possibilities, not certainties.  \n\nWhen we rephrase it as \"It *might* be that the blurble is blurble for a flump and the wumble is snizzle\", we are still dealing with possibilities. We are not stating these things as facts, but rather suggesting they are potential outcomes.\n\nSince the meaning and level of certainty remain the same, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
