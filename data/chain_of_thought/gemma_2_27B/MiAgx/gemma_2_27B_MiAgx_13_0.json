The zooble is in quimble.\n2. The plonk flimble fribble.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"It might be that the zooble is in quimble and the plonk flimbles fribble.\" This combines both possibilities into a single statement.\n\nSince the original sentence only states that each possibility *might* be true, we cannot definitively say that both are true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
