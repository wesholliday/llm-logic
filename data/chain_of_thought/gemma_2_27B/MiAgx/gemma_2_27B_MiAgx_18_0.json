The floob might be gribble blurble shimble.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer a combined statement that both of these possibilities are true.  \n\nSince the original statement uses \"might be\" which indicates possibility, not certainty, we cannot definitively say both things are true.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
