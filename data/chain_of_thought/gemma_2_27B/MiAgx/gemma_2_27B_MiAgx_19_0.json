The crunk is wibble fribble.\n2. The frazzle quorks snork.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that \"It might be that the crunk is wibble fribble and the frazzle quorks snork\". This combines both possibilities into a single statement. Since the original sentence only states that each possibility *might* be true, we cannot definitively say that both are true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
