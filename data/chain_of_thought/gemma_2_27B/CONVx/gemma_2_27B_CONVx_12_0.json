The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n\n* P: The smip was shripped\n* Q: The smip lupped the zoint\n\nWe cannot infer the reverse of a conditional statement just from the original statement.  \n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n\nThis doesn't mean that if the ground is wet (Q), it must be raining (P). The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, just because a smip lupped a zoint doesn't automatically mean it was previously shripped. There could be other reasons why the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
