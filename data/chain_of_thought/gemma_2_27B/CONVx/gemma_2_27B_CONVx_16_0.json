The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q**  (If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer the *converse* of this statement:\n\n* **If Q, then P** (If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled)\n\nIn general, you **cannot** infer the converse of a conditional statement from the original statement.  Just because one thing leads to another doesn't mean the second thing automatically leads back to the first.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it rains, the ground gets wet. \n* But if the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it rained (it could have been sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
