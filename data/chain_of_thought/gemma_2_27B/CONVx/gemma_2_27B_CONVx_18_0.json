It doesn't say anything about whether nugging leads to plooking.  \n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it rains, the ground gets wet. \n* Does that mean if the ground is wet, it must have rained? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, there could be other reasons why the shank might be nugged besides it being plooked.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
