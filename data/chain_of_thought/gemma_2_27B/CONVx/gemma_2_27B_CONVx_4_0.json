Just because one event follows another doesn't mean the first event caused the second. \n\nThe original statement tells us that *if* a fribble is snurgled, *then* it will crinkle. It doesn't say anything about what happens if a fribble crinkles. There could be other reasons why a fribble might crinkle besides being snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
