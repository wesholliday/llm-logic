The original statement establishes a conditional relationship:\n\n* **If** the dreb was vroombed, **then** the dreb was spened.\n\nThis does *not* mean the reverse is also true.  \n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nThis doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, just because something was spened doesn't automatically mean it was vroombed. There could be other ways for a dreb to be spened.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
