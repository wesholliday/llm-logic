The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* If A (shirt is cotton), then B (pants are denim).\n\nWe cannot automatically assume the reverse is also true:\n\n* If not A (shirt is not cotton), then not B (pants are not denim).\n\nThere could be other reasons why the pants are denim, even if the shirt isn't cotton.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
