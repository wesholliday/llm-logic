The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* If A (griffin in the forest), then B (unicorn in the forest).\n\nWe cannot automatically assume the reverse is also true:\n\n* If not A (griffin not in the forest), then not B (unicorn not in the forest).\n\nThere could be other reasons for the unicorn to be in the forest even if the griffin isn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
