The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* If A (bear in cave), then B (wolf in den).\n\nWe cannot automatically assume the reverse is also true:\n\n* If not A (bear not in cave), then not B (wolf not in den).\n\nThere could be other reasons why the wolf might be in the den, even if the bear isn't in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
