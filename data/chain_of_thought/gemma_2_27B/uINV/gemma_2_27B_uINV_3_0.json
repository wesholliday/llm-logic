The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* If A (James wrote the book), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nThe question then asks us to consider the opposite of A (not James wrote the book) and conclude the opposite of B (the book is not a mystery novel). This doesn't necessarily follow.\n\nThere could be other authors who write mystery novels. Just because James didn't write the book doesn't mean it can't be a mystery.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
