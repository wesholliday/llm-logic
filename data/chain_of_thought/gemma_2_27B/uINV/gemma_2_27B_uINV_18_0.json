The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* If A (doll is plastic), then B (truck is metal).\n\nWe cannot automatically assume the reverse is also true:\n\n* If not A (doll is not plastic), then not B (truck is not metal).\n\nThere could be other reasons why the truck is metal, even if the doll isn't plastic.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
