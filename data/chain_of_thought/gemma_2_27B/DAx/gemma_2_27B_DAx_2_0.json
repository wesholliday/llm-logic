(This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** The wug was not flooped. (This negates the condition in Premise 1)\n\nSince the condition for the wug bimming the zoint was not met (the wug wasn't flooped), we can logically conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
