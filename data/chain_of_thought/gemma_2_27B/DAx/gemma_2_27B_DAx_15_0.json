            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using hypothetical syllogism. \n\n* **Premise 1:** If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened. (This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** The dreb was not vroombed. (This negates the condition in Premise 1)\n\nSince the condition for \"spended\" was not met (the dreb wasn't vroombed), we can logically conclude that the dreb was not spened.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
