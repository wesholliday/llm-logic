            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical syllogism. \n\n* **Premise 1:** If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n* **Premise 2:** The splat was not morphed.\n\nWe can see that the first premise sets up a conditional statement:  \"If P, then Q\" (If morphed, then quanked). The second premise tells us that \"P\" (morphed) is false.  \n\nIn logic, if the \"if\" part of a conditional statement is false, then the entire statement is considered true.  Since the splat wasn't morphed, the condition for quanking wasn't met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
