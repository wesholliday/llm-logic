If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\n* The second premise sets up a conditional statement:  If A (vroombed) then B (spened).\n\n* Since we know A (the dreb was vroombed) is true from the first premise, we can logically conclude that B (the dreb was spened) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
