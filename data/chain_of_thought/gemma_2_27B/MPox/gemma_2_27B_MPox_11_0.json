We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The flug was blummed.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nThis structure follows the form of a deductive argument:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP is true.\nTherefore, Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\nIf the flug was blummed (P), then the flug was zimmed (Q).\nThe flug was blummed (P is true).\nTherefore, the flug was zimmed (Q is true).\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
