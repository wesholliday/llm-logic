We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The flugel was blimmed.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nThis structure follows the form of a deductive argument:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP is true.\nTherefore, Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\nIf the flugel was blimmed (P), then the flugel was zargled (Q).\nThe flugel was blimmed (P is true).\nTherefore, the flugel was zargled (Q is true).\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
