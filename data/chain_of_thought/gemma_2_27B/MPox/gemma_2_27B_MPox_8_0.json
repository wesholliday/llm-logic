            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical syllogism. We have two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** The sprocket was cranked.\n2. **Premise 2:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe structure of these premises follows a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\".  In this case, P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\nSince we know P is true (premise 1), and we know that if P is true then Q must also be true (premise 2), we can logically conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
