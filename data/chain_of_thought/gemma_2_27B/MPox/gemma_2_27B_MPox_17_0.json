We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The flob was skizzled.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nThis structure follows the form of a modus ponens argument:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP is true.\nTherefore, Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\nIf the flob was skizzled (P), then the flob movated (Q).\nThe flob was skizzled (P is true).\nTherefore, the flob movated (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
