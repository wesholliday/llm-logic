We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The zinger was fraggled.\n* **Premise 2:** If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nThis structure follows the form of a deductive argument:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP is true.\nTherefore, Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\nIf the zinger was fraggled (P), then the zinger was smoogled (Q).\nThe zinger was fraggled (P).\nTherefore, the zinger was smoogled (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
