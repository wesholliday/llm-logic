We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The fribble was snurgled.\n* **Premise 2:** If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nThis structure follows the form of a modus ponens argument:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP is true.\nTherefore, Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\nIf the fribble was snurgled (P), then the fribble crinked (Q).\nThe fribble was snurgled (P).\nTherefore, the fribble crinked (Q).\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
