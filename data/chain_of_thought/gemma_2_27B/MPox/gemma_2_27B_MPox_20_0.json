We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The fleeg was bluttered.\n* **Premise 2:** If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nThis structure follows the form of a modus ponens argument:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* P.\n* Therefore, Q.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The fleeg was bluttered.\n* Q = The fleeg surned.\n\nSince both premises are true, we can logically conclude that the conclusion is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
