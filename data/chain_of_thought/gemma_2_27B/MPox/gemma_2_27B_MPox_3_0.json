We have:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The splat was morphed.\n* **Premise 2:** If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nThese premises follow a structure where the conclusion of the second premise is the same as the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the first premise. This allows us to logically deduce the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the second premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
