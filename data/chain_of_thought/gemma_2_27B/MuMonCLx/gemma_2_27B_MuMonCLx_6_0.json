This means that for the quimble to fulfill the requirement, it needs to be BOTH \"bimboozle wobble\" AND \"snizzle at crunk fizzle\".  Since the question only asks if we can infer \"The quimble must be bimboozle wobble\", and the original statement explicitly states this as a requirement, we can indeed infer this.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
