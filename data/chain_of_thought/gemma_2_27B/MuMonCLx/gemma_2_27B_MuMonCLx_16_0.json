This means that for the snizzle to fulfill the requirement, it needs to be both \"quimble zump\" and \"frazzle plimp blimple\".  Since the question asks if we can infer \"The snizzle must be quimble zump\", and the original statement requires both conditions to be true, we can indeed infer that the snizzle must be quimble zump.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
