This means that for the zooble to be considered \"zibber\", it needs to fulfill two conditions: being \"zibber for a blimple\" and being \"zibber for a wump\".  \n\nSince the first condition is only one part of the overall requirement for being \"zibber\", we cannot definitively say that the zooble must be \"zibber for a blimple\" alone.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
