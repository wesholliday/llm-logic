            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn.\n\n* **Premise:** \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This confirms the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n* **Deduction:** Since the consequence (unicorn in the forest) is true, and the conditional statement links the griffin's presence to the unicorn's presence, we can deduce that the griffin must also have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
