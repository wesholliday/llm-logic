This doesn't mean that Jen *only* watches basketball when Tom watches football, just that if Tom watches football, Jen will definitely watch basketball. We also know that \"Jen watched basketball\".  \n\nWhile we know Jen watched basketball, the original statement doesn't say that's the *only* reason she would watch basketball. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
