However, this doesn't necessarily mean that P is also true. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* The ground is wet (Q).\n\nDoes this mean it must be raining (P)? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons, like someone watering the lawn.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
