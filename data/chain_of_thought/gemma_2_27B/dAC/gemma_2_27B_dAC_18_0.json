We have a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This doesn't mean that a metal truck *must* have a plastic doll. There could be other reasons for the truck to be metal.  The second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" only tells us about the truck. It doesn't give us any information about the doll.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
