It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This presents two possibilities: the scarf is on the coat rack, OR it's in the backpack.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the scarf doesn't *have* to be on the coat rack, the second statement forces the conclusion that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
