They could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This presents two possibilities: the cookies are in the pantry, or they are in the jar.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the cookies don't have to be in the pantry, the second statement forces the conclusion that they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
