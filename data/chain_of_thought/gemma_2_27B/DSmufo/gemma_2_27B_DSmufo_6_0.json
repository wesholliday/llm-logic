It could be elsewhere.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This presents two possibilities: the phone is ringing in the kitchen, OR it's in the living room.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the phone doesn't *have* to be ringing in the kitchen, the second statement forces us to consider the alternative: the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
