It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This presents two possibilities: the umbrella is in the closet, or it's in the car.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the umbrella doesn't *have* to be in the closet, the second statement forces the conclusion that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
