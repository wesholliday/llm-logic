It could be somewhere else.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\" This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the watch doesn't have to be on his wrist, the second statement forces the conclusion that the watch must be charging on the dresser to make the \"or\" statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
