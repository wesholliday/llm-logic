(This sets up a rule: Dog inside implies Cat outside)\n* **Premise 2:** The dog was not inside. (This tells us the condition in Premise 1 is false)\n\nSince the condition in Premise 1 is false, we cannot automatically conclude anything about the cat's location. The cat could be outside, or it could be inside.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
