            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This sets up a rule: if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n\n* **Given Information:** \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This tells us the antecedent of our conditional statement is false.\n\n* **Logical Inference:**  In a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything definite about the consequent. The pants could be denim or not denim. The original statement only tells us what happens if the shirt *is* cotton.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
