Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The alien visited Mars\n* Q: The robot visited Jupiter\n\nWe are given:\n\n* \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (If P, then Q)\n* \"The alien did not visit Mars\" (Not P)\n\nSince the antecedent (the alien visiting Mars) is false, we can conclude that the consequent (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
