            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a conditional statement. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn.\n\n* **Given Information:** \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This negates the condition in the conditional statement.\n\n* **Logical Inference:** Since the condition (griffin in the forest) is false, we cannot conclude anything definite about the unicorn. The unicorn could be in the forest or not. The original statement only tells us what happens if the griffin is present.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
