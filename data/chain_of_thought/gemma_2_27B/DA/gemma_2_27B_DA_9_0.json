(This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\")\n* **Premise 2:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (This negates the \"P\" part of the conditional statement)\n\nSince the first premise states that Mark buying the blue shirt is *dependent* on Lisa buying the red shirt, and we know Lisa *didn't* buy the red shirt, we can infer that the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt was not met.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
