Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Ben ate pasta\n* Q: Kate ate the salad\n\nWe are given:\n\n* \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" (If P, then Q)\n* \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (Not P)\n\nSince we know Ben did not eat pasta (Not P), and the original statement says that if he did eat pasta, then Kate would have eaten the salad, we can conclude that Kate did not eat the salad (Not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
