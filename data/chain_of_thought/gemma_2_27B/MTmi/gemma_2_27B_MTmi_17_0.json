This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Kate might not have eaten salad. This means it's possible Kate didn't eat salad.\n\nSince the first premise states that Kate *must* eat salad if Ben eats pasta, and the second premise says Kate *might not* have eaten salad, we can conclude that Ben likely did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
