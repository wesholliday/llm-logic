This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The truck might not have been metal. This introduces doubt about the consequence of the first premise.\n\nSince the second premise suggests the truck might *not* be metal, and the first premise states the truck *must* be metal if the doll is plastic, we can infer that the doll likely wasn't plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
