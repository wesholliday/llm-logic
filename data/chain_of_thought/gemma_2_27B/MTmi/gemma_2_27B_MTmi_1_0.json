This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means it's possible Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nSince the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue *must* be there, and the second premise says Sue *might not* be there, we can conclude that Mary likely wasn't at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
