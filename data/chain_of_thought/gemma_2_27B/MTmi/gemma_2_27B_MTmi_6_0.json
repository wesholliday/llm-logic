This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means it's possible Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\nIf we assume Sue chose pizza (making the first premise true), then Bob *must* have chosen pasta according to the first premise. But the second premise tells us Bob *might not* have chosen pasta. These two statements contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that Sue chose pizza must be false to avoid the contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
