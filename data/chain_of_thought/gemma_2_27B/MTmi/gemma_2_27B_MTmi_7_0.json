This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Chris might not have finished the race. This means it's possible Chris didn't finish.\n\nSince the first premise states that if Alex finishes, Chris *must* also finish, and the second premise says Chris *might not* have finished, we can conclude that Alex likely did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
