            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This sets up a conditional relationship: Cotton shirt implies denim pants.\n* **Premise 2:** The pants might not have been denim. This introduces doubt about the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\nSince the pants might not have been denim, it means the condition (cotton shirt) might not have been met.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
