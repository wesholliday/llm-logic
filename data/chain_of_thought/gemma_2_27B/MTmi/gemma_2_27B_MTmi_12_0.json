This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means it's possible Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n\nSince the first premise states that if Joe went to the park, Lucy *must* go to the zoo, and the second premise says Lucy *might not* have gone to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe likely did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
