This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Amy might not have played tennis. This means it's possible Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nSince the first premise states that Jeff playing basketball *guarantees* Amy playing tennis, and the second premise says Amy *might not* have played tennis, the only way for both to be true is if Jeff did *not* play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
