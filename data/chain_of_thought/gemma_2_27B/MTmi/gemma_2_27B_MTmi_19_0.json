It means that Jen watching basketball is a necessary consequence of Tom watching football.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This statement tells us that it's possible Jen didn't watch basketball.\n\nSince Jen watching basketball is a *necessary* condition for Tom watching football (according to statement 1), and we know Jen *might not* have watched basketball (statement 2), we can conclude that it's possible Tom didn't watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
