This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Erin might not have taken a train. This means it's possible Erin didn't take a train.\n\nSince the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, Erin *must* take a train, and the second premise says Erin *might not* have taken a train, we can conclude that Sam likely did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
