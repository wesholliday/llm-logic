This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The banana might not have been yellow. This introduces doubt about the consequence of the first premise.\n\nSince the second premise suggests the banana might not be yellow, and the first premise states that a red apple *must* lead to a yellow banana, we can infer that the apple likely wasn't red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
