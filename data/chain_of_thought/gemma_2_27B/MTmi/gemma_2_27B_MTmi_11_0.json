Premise 1 tells us that if a certain condition is true (the cake being chocolate), then a consequence must also be true (the muffins being blueberry).\n\nPremise 2 tells us that the consequence (muffins being blueberry) is not necessarily true. This means the condition (cake being chocolate) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
