This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The truck might not have been blue. This means the truck could have been blue, or it could have been another color.\n\nWe're trying to determine if we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nSince the truck *might not* have been blue, it's possible the first premise is false. If the first premise is false, then the condition (the car being red) doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion (the truck being blue).  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
