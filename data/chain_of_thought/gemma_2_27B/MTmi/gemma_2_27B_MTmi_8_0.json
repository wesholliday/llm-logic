It means that the vampire being awake is a *sufficient* condition for the mummy being awake.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This statement tells us the mummy's state is uncertain.\n\nSince the mummy *might not* have been awake, it means the condition for the vampire being awake (from Statement 1) might not have been met.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not necessarily awake.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
