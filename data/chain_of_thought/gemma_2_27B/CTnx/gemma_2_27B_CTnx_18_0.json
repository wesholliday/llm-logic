It's possible for something to be \"nugged\" without being \"plooked.\"\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, the ground is wet.\n* This doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. It could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
