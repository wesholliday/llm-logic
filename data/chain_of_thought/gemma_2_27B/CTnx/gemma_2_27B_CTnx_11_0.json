The original statement tells us that if a \"flug\" is \"blummed,\" it cannot be \"zimmed.\"  However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if a \"flug\" is \"zimmed.\" It's possible for a \"flug\" to be \"zimmed\" without being \"blummed.\"\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* Does that mean if the ground is wet, it must be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
