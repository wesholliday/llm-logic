It doesn't say anything about what happens if a glip is tragged. It's possible for a glip to be tragged without being slogged.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nThis doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
