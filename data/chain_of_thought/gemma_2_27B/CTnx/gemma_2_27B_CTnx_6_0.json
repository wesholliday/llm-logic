There could be other reasons why the grommet didn't plop the frink.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nThis doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
