It doesn't say anything about what happens if a dreb is spened. It could be vroombed, or it could be something else entirely.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nThis doesn't mean that if the ground is wet, it must be raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons, like someone watering the lawn.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
