It doesn't say anything about what happens if something *is* smoogled. It could be that smoogled things are never fraggled, or they could be something else entirely.\n\nWe can't assume that because something isn't fraggled, it must be smoogled. There could be other possibilities.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
