            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical fallacy called denying the antecedent.  \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* If P (smip was shripped), then Q (smip did not lup the zoint).\n\nThe proposed inference is the inverse of this statement:\n\n* If Q (smip lupped the zoint), then not P (smip was not shripped).\n\nWhile a conditional statement being true doesn't necessarily make its inverse true, it's easy to see why this seems intuitive. We tend to think if one thing causes another, then the absence of the first thing means the second thing also can't happen. However, there could be other reasons why the smip didn't lup the zoint besides it being shripped.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
