It doesn't say anything about what happens if a sneg *doesn't* sprout the frink.  \n\nIt's possible for a sneg to not sprout the frink for reasons other than being crampled. Maybe it's too young, or maybe it lacks the right nutrients.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if a sneg sprouted the frink, it must not have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
