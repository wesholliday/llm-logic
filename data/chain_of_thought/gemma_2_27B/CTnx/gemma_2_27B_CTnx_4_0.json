The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q** (If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order:\n\n* **If not Q, then not P**\n\nApplying this to our original statement:\n\n* **If the fribble did crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.**\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
