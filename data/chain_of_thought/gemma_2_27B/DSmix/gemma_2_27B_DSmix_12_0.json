This sets up two possibilities: the smip is shripped, or it's lupped.\n* **Premise 2:** The smip might not be lupped. This means it's possible the smip is *not* lupped.\n\nIf the smip is not lupped, and the only other option is that it's shripped, then we can conclude that the smip must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
