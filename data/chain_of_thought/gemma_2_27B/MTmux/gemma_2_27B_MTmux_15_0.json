This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This is the negation of Q.\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The dreb was vroombed.\n* Q: The dreb must have been spened.\n\nSince we know Q is false (Premise 2), we can apply modus tollens to conclude that P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
