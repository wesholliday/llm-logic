(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. (This is the negation of Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to see if we can reach a conclusion. Modus tollens states:\n\nIf If P, then Q, and it's not the case that Q, then it's not the case that P.\n\nApplying this to our premises:\n\n* P = The smonk was vreebled\n* Q = The smonk must have plagged\n\nSince we know \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\" (not Q), and we have the conditional statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" (If P, then Q), we can conclude \"It's not the case that the smonk was vreebled\" (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
