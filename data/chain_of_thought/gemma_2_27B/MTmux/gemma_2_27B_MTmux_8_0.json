(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", then we can conclude \"Not P\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The sprocket was cranked\n* Q = The sprocket must have been daggled\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (the sprocket must not have been daggled), and \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude \"Not P\" (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
