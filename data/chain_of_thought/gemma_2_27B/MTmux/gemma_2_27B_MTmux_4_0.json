(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. (This is the negation of Q)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The fribble was not snurgled. (This is the negation of P)\n\nThis situation matches the structure of *modus tollens*, a valid argument form in logic:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\nTherefore, not P\n\nSince our premises fit the structure of modus tollens, the conclusion is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
