(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", then we can conclude \"Not P\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The zinger was fraggled\n* Q = The zinger must have been smoogled\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled), and \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude \"Not P\" (The zinger was not fraggled).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
