(This is a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it must have been surned\")\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. (This is the negation of Q: \u00acQ)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The fleeg was not bluttered. (\u00acP)\n\nThis situation represents a classic example of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q, and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = \"the fleeg was bluttered\"\n* Q = \"it must have been surned\"\n* \u00acQ = \"it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned\"\n* \u00acP = \"the fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\nSince our premises match the structure of modus tollens, the conclusion is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
