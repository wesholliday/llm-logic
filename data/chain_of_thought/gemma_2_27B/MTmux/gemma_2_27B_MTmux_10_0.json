It means that if the first part (the wug being sproinged) is true, then the second part (it being garpled) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\" This statement negates the idea that the wug had to be garpled.\n\nNow, we need to see if these statements lead us to the conclusion \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nSince the second statement tells us the wug *didn't* have to be garpled, and the first statement says that sproinging *leads* to garpling, we can infer that the wug couldn't have been sproinged in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
