Modus tollens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and \"Q is false,\" then \"P must be false.\"\n\nIn our case:\n\n* We know \"If P, then Q\" is true (Statement 1).\n* We know \"Q is false\" (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, applying modus tollens, we can conclude that \"P must be false.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
