(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the glip must have tragged. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P).\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The glip was slogged.\n* Q: The glip must have tragged.\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (It's not the case that the glip must have tragged), we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\" (The glip was not slogged).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
