(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. (This is the negation of Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\", then we can conclude \"not P\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The flug was blummed\n* Q = The flug must have been zimmed\n\nSince we know \"not Q\" (It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed), and \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude \"not P\" (The flug was not blummed).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
