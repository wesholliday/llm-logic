(This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. (This negates the consequent of the conditional statement: Not Q)\n\nWe can use a technique called *modus tollens* to analyze this. Modus tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", then we can conclude \"Not P\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The wug was flooped\n* Q = The wug must have bimmed the zoint\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (the wug must *not* have bimmed the zoint), and \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude \"Not P\" (the wug was *not* flooped).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
