It can be represented as:\n\n   P \u2192 Q \n   Where P = \"The twonk was plinked\" and Q = \"The twonk was varnished\"\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\" This negates the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement. It can be represented as:\n\n   \u00acQ\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" (\u00acP) from these statements.\n\nUsing logical reasoning, if the consequent (Q) of a conditional statement is false (\u00acQ), then the antecedent (P) must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, since we know \u00acQ (the twonk was not varnished), and we know P \u2192 Q (if plinked, then varnished), we can conclude that \u00acP (the twonk was not plinked).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
