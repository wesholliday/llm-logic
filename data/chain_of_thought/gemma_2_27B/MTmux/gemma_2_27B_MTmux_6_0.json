It says that if the first part (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the second part (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n\nSince the consequence of the first statement is negated in the second statement, we can conclude that the condition of the first statement must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
