It doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt is *not* cotton.  \n\nIt's possible the pants are denim even if the shirt isn't cotton. For example, someone could wear denim pants with a silk shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
