            "content": "Explanation: \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition is met (Ben eating pasta), then a certain consequence follows (Kate eating salad).  \n\nThe proposed inference is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n* If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n\nThe inverse would be:\n\n* If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\n\nThis isn't always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons, like someone watering the lawn.\n\nSimilarly, just because Ben didn't eat pasta doesn't automatically mean Kate didn't eat salad. She could have eaten salad for other reasons.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
