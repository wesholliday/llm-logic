There could be other reasons the robot might visit Jupiter.\n\nThe proposed inference reverses the condition and negates both parts:\n\n* **If** the alien did *not* visit Mars, **then** the robot did *not* visit Jupiter.\n\nThis is too strong of a conclusion.  The alien not visiting Mars doesn't automatically mean the robot didn't visit Jupiter for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
