It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the car being red), then a certain consequence follows (the truck being blue).  \n\nThe proposed inference is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Original:** If P, then Q.\n* **Inverse:** If not P, then not Q.\n\nThese two statements don't always have the same truth value.\n\nFor example, if the car wasn't red, we don't know anything about the color of the truck. It could be blue, green, yellow, etc.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
