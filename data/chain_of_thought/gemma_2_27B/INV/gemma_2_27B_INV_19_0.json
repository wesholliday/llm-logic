            "content": "Explanation: \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement: If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball).  \n\nThe statement we want to infer is the inverse of the original: If not P (Tom did not watch football), then not Q (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nConditional statements and their inverses are not logically equivalent. Just because one thing implies another doesn't mean the absence of the first thing implies the absence of the second.\n\nFor example, if it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). But if the ground is not wet (not Q), it doesn't necessarily mean it's not raining (not P). It could be dry for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
