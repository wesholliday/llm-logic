This means it's possible the grommet is not plopped.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This presents two possibilities: the grommet is plopped, or it's sploffed. There's no other option.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the grommet *might not* be plopped, and the second premise says it *must* be either plopped or sploffed, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
