This means it's possible the whiffle is tinked, but it's also possible it's not.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. This sets up an \"or\" situation, meaning one of these options *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the whiffle might not be tinked, and the second premise says it must be either tinked or shanked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
