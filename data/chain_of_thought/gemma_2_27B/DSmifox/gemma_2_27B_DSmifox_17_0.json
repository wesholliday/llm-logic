This means it's possible the flob is motivated, and it's also possible it's not.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the flob must be motivated or it is skizzled. This sets up an \"or\" situation, meaning one of these conditions *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the flob might *not* be motivated, and the second premise says it *must* be either motivated or skizzled, the only way for the second premise to be true is if the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
