This means it's possible the wug is bimmed, but it's also possible it isn't.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped. This sets up an \"or\" situation, meaning one or the other must be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the wug might *not* be bimmed, and the second premise says it must be either bimmed *or* flooped, we can conclude that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
