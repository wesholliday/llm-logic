This means it's possible the clug is not snugged.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. This sets up an \"or\" situation, meaning one of these conditions *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the clug might *not* be snugged, and the second premise says it *must* be either snugged or fleeked, we can conclude that the clug must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
