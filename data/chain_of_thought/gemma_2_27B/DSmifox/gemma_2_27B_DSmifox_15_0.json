This means it's possible the dreb is spened, but it's also possible it's not.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed. This sets up an \"or\" situation, meaning one of these options *must* be true.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the dreb might *not* be spened, the second premise forces the conclusion that the dreb *must* be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
