This means it's possible the smonk is not plagged.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This is a statement of exclusivity - the smonk can only be in one of these two states.\n\nSince the first premise tells us the smonk might *not* be plagged, and the second premise says it *must* be either plagged or vreebled, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
