This means it's possible the wug is garpled, but it's also possible it's not.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true.\n\nWe know the wug can't be both garpled and sproinged at the same time (they are mutually exclusive).\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the wug might *not* be garpled, and Premise 2 says it must be *either* garpled *or* sproinged, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
