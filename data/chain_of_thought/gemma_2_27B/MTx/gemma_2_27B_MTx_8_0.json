            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using modus tollens. \n\n* **Premise 1:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n* **Premise 2:** The sprocket was not daggled.\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nModus tollens states that if a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, \"cranked\" is our P and \"daggled\" is our Q. Since we know \"daggled\" is false (not daggled), and the original statement says \"if cranked, then daggled,\" we can conclude that \"cranked\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
