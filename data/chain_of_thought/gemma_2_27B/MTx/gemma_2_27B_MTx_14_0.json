Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The clug was fleeked.\n* Q: The clug snugged.\n\nSince we know Q is false (the clug did not snugged), and the original statement is true, then P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
