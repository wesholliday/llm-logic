We're given two premises:\n\n1. **If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.** (This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n2. **The robot did not visit Jupiter.** (This is a negation of Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars (not P).\n\nSince the robot did not visit Jupiter, and we know that the robot visiting Jupiter is dependent on the alien visiting Mars, we can logically conclude that the alien must not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
