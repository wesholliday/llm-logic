The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThe argument structure is a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and its negation (Not Q).  If the first premise is true, and the second premise is true, then we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement (P) must be false.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nSince we know the unicorn was not in the forest (Not Q), we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
