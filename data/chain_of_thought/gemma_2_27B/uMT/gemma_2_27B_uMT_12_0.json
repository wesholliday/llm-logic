            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument. We're given a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This doesn't mean Lucy *always* goes to the zoo when Joe goes to the park, just that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy going to the zoo is a guaranteed consequence.\n\nWe're also told Lucy did *not* go to the zoo. Since the original statement says Lucy going to the zoo is dependent on Joe going to the park, if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it means the condition (Joe going to the park) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
