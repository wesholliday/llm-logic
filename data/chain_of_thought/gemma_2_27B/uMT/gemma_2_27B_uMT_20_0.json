Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The apple was red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow.\n\nSince we know the banana was not yellow (Q is false), and we are given that \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, we can conclude that the apple was not red (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
