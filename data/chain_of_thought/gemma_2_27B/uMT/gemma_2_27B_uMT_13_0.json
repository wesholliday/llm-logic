Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The car was red.\n* Q: The truck was blue.\n\nSince we know the truck was not blue (Q is false), and we are given that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, we can conclude that the car was not red (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
