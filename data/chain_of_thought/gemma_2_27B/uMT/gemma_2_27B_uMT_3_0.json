The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThese statements create a situation where the first statement's condition (the book being written by James) cannot be true because it would lead to a contradiction with the second statement.\n\nSince the conclusion of the first statement cannot be true, we can infer that the initial condition is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
