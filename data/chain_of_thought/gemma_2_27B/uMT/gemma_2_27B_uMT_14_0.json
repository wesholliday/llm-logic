Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave.\n* Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\nSince we know Q is false (the wolf was not in the den), and the conditional statement is assumed true, then P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
