We are given two premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. **Premise 2:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThese premises create a situation where the first premise is conditional. It states that *if* Lisa buys the red shirt, *then* something else happens (Mark buys the blue shirt).\n\nSince we know the consequence of the first premise is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), we can conclude that the initial condition must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
