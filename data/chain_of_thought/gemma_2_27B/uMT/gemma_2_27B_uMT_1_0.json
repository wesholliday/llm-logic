            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument. We are given two premises:\n\n1. **If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.** This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. **Sue was not at the wedding.** This is a direct statement.\n\nSince we know Sue was not at the wedding, and the first premise states that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary must not have been at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
