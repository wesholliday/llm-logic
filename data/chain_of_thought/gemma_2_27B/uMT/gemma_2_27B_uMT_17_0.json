Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Ben ate pasta\n* Q: Kate ate salad\n\nSince we know Q is false (Kate did not eat salad), and the conditional statement is true, we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
