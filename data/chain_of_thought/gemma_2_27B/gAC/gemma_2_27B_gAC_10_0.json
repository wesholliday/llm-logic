We're given a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This doesn't automatically mean that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.  \n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the dog is inside. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the dog is *outside*.\n\n* The cat being outside could be due to other reasons unrelated to the dog's location.\n\nTherefore, we can't conclude that the dog was inside just because the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
