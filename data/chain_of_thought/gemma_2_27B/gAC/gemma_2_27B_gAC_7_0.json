The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" can be represented as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q \n\nWhere:\n\n* P = Alex finished the race\n* Q = Chris finished the race\n\nWe are given that both Q (Chris finished the race) is true and the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true.  \n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement is true and the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
