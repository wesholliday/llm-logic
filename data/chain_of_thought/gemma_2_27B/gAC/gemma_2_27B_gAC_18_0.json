We know Q is true (the truck was metal). However, this doesn't automatically mean P (the doll was plastic) must also be true.\n\nThink of it this way: the statement only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic. It doesn't say the doll *has* to be plastic for the truck to be metal. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
