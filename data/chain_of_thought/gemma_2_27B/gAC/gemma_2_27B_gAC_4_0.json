The original statement tells us that if the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q). We know Q is true, but that doesn't automatically mean P is also true.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* It's possible the robot visited Jupiter for a reason unrelated to the alien visiting Mars.\n\nThere could be other reasons why the robot went to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
