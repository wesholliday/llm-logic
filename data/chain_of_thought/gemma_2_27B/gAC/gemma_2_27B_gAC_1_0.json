The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q \n\nWhere:\n* P = Mary was at the wedding\n* Q = Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe are given that Q (Sue was at the wedding) is true.  However, knowing that the consequence (Q) is true doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (P) is also true. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding for a reason unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nThink of it this way: the statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary isn't at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
