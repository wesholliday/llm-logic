The original statement is \"If P, then Q\", and its converse is \"If Q, then P\".\n\nWhile the original statement (If P, then Q) is true, its converse is not necessarily true. Just because the muffins are blueberry doesn't automatically mean the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons why the muffins are blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
