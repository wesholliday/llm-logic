It uses \"or\" to separate the options, indicating that the quazzle could be any one of them.  This structure implies that the quazzle being flibbit is a separate possibility from it being quibble grazzle glorp.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the quazzle might be quibble grazzle glorp or it might be flibbit.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
