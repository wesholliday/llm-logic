            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" can be understood as a conditional statement: if P (Tom watched football) then Q (Jen watched basketball). The second part of the question states that \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" which implies that it is possible that Q is false. \n\nIn logical terms, if Q is false (Jen did not watch basketball), then for the conditional statement to hold true, P must also be false. This is because a conditional statement is only false when the first part (P) is true and the second part (Q) is false. Therefore, if it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
