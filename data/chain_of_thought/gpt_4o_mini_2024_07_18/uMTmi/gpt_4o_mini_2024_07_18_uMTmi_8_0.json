            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. The first statement says, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- If V (vampire is awake), then M (mummy is awake). \n\nThis implies that the vampire's being awake guarantees the mummy's being awake. The second statement says, \"the mummy might not have been awake,\" which means that it is possible that M is false (the mummy is not awake).\n\nNow, if we consider the first statement and the possibility that the mummy is not awake (M is false), we can conclude that the vampire cannot be awake either. This is because if V were true (the vampire is awake), then M would have to be true (the mummy must be awake), which contradicts the possibility that M is false. Therefore, if the mummy might not have been awake, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
