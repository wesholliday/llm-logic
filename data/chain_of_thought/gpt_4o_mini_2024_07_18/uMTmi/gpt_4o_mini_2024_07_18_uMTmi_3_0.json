The second statement introduces the possibility that the book might not be a mystery novel. If we accept the second statement as true, it creates a scenario where the book is not a mystery novel. Given the first statement, if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot be true that the book was written by James. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
