            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" establishes a conditional relationship. This means that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. However, the second part of the statement, \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo,\" suggests that it is possible for Lucy to not have gone to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the condition that Joe went to the park cannot be true, because it would contradict the initial conditional statement. Therefore, if we accept that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
