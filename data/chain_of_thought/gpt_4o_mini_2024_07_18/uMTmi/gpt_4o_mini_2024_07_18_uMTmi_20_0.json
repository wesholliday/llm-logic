            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" establishes a conditional relationship. This means that if the apple is indeed red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the second statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" introduces a possibility that the banana is not yellow. If the banana is not yellow, then the condition that the apple is red cannot hold true, because that would contradict the first statement. Therefore, if we accept that the banana might not be yellow, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
