            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance. This means that if Mary is present, Sue's presence is guaranteed. However, the second statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" indicates that it is possible for Sue to be absent. If Sue is indeed absent, then according to the first statement, Mary cannot be present either, because her presence would necessitate Sue's presence. Therefore, if there is a possibility that Sue is not at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary is also not at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
