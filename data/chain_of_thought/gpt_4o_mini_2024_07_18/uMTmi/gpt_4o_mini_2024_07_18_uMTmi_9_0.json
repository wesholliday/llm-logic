            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" establishes a conditional relationship. This means that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt. However, the second part of the statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" suggests that it is possible for Mark to not have the blue shirt. If Mark does not have the blue shirt, then the condition that Lisa bought the red shirt cannot be true, because that would contradict the initial conditional statement. Therefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
