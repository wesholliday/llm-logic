            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This means that if we assume the doll is plastic, it necessarily follows that the truck is metal. The second statement, \"the truck might not have been metal,\" introduces a possibility that the truck is not metal. \n\nIf the truck is not metal, then the first statement cannot hold true because it would contradict the condition that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal. Therefore, if the truck is not metal, we can conclude that the doll cannot be plastic, as that would create a contradiction. \n\nThus, since the truck might not be metal, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
