            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. However, the reverse is not necessarily true; just because Sue was at the wedding does not imply that Mary was also there. The logical structure can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Let M represent \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n2. Let S represent \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe first statement can be expressed as: \n- If M, then S (M \u2192 S).\n\nThe second statement tells us:\n- S is true (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot conclude that M is true (Mary was at the wedding) because the conditional statement does not provide a way to deduce M from S. The only thing we can conclude is that if Mary were at the wedding, then Sue would have to be there, which we already know is true. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
