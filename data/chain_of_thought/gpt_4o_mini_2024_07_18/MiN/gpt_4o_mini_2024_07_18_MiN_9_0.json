            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" suggests that there is a possibility that she did not purchase it. This implies uncertainty about her buying the shirt. The phrase \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" indicates that it is not certain or necessary that she bought it. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that she did not buy the shirt, it aligns with the idea that it is not a certainty that she did. Therefore, we can infer that if there is a possibility she did not buy it, then it is indeed not the case that she must have bought it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
