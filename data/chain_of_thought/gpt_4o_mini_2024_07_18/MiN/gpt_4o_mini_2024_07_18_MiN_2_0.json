            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" suggests that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This implies that it is not certain that the griffin was in the forest. The phrase \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" indicates that there is no necessity for the griffin to have been in the forest, which aligns with the idea that it might not have been there. Therefore, the inference is valid because if something might not be true, it cannot be said to be a necessity that it is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
