            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not located in the drawer. This implies that it is not certain that the notebook is in the drawer. The phrase \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" conveys a similar idea, indicating that it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer. Both statements express a lack of certainty about the notebook's location, allowing us to infer that if it might not be in the drawer, then it cannot be said that it must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
