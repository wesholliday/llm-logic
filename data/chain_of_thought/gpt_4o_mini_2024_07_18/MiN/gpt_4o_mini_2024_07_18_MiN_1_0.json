            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding. This implies that it is not certain that she was there. The phrase \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" indicates that we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding. Since \"might not\" allows for the possibility of her absence, it aligns with the idea that we cannot assert she must have been there. Therefore, we can infer that if there is a possibility she was not there, then it is indeed not the case that she must have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
