            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" suggests that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. This implies that visiting Mars is not a certainty for the alien. The phrase \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" indicates that it is not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars, which aligns with the idea that there is a possibility of not visiting. Therefore, the inference is valid because if it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars, it logically follows that it is not a necessity for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
