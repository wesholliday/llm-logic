            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" suggests that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This implies that choosing pizza is not a certainty for her. The phrase \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" indicates that it is not necessary or obligatory for Sue to have chosen pizza, which aligns with the idea that there is a possibility she did not. Therefore, the inference that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" can be drawn from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
