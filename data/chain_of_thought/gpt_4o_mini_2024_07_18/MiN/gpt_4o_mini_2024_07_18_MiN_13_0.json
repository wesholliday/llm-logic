            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not located in the toy box. This implies uncertainty about the toy's location. The phrase \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" indicates that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, which aligns with the idea that there is a possibility of it being elsewhere. Since the first statement allows for the possibility of the toy being outside the toy box, it supports the conclusion that it is not a requirement for the toy to be in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy does not have to be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
