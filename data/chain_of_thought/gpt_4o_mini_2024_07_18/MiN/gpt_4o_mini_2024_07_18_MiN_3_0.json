            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" suggests that there is a possibility that James did not write the book. This implies that it is not certain that James is the author. The phrase \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" conveys a similar idea, indicating that it is not a definitive requirement or necessity for James to be the author. Both statements express uncertainty regarding James's authorship, thus they can be seen as equivalent in meaning. Therefore, we can infer that if the book might not have been written by James, it logically follows that it is not the case that the book must have been written by him.\n\nAnswer: yes",
