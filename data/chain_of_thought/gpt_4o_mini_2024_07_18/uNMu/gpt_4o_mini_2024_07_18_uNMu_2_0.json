This implies that there are other possibilities regarding the griffin's location. Therefore, we can infer that it is possible that the griffin might not have been in the forest, as the negation of a necessity allows for alternative scenarios, including the possibility of the griffin being elsewhere. \n\nAnswer: yes",
