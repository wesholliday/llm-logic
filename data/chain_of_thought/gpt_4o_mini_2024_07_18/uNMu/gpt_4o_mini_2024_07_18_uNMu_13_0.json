            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" suggests that there is no requirement for the toy to be in the toy box. This implies that the toy could be either in the toy box or outside of it. Since the statement does not assert that the toy is definitely in the toy box, we can infer that it is possible for the toy to be outside the toy box. Therefore, we can conclude that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
