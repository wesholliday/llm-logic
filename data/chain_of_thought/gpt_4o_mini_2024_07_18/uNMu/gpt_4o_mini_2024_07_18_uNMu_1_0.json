This implies that there is a possibility that she was not there. The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a strong necessity or obligation, and negating that means we cannot conclude with certainty that she was there. Therefore, it opens up the possibility that she might not have been at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
