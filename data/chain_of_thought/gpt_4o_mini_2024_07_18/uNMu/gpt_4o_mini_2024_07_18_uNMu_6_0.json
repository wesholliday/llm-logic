This means that there is at least a possibility that she did not choose pizza. The phrase \"might not have chosen pizza\" suggests that there is a chance or potential for that outcome. Since the negation of a necessity (must) allows for the possibility of the opposite (might not), we can indeed infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
