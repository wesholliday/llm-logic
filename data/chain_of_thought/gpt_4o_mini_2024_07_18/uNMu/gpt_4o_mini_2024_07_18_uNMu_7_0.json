This implies that there is at least a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. The phrase \"must have\" indicates a strong necessity, and negating that means we cannot conclude with certainty that Alex finished. Therefore, it opens up the possibility that Alex might not have finished the race. \n\nAnswer: yes",
