            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" suggests that it is not a certainty that she bought it. This implies that there is a possibility that she did not buy the red shirt. The phrase \"might not have bought\" indicates that there is a chance or potential for that outcome. Therefore, from the original statement, we can infer that it is indeed possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
