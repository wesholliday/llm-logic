This implies that there are other possibilities for the jacket's location. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair, as it could be placed elsewhere or not placed at all. The absence of a requirement allows for the possibility of alternative scenarios.\n\nAnswer: yes",
