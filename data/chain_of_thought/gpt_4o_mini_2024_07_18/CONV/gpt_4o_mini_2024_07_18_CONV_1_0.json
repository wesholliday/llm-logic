            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). This means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. However, this does not imply the reverse, which would be \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" (or \"If Q, then P\"). The reverse statement is not necessarily true because there could be situations where Sue is at the wedding without Mary being there. Therefore, we cannot infer the reverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
