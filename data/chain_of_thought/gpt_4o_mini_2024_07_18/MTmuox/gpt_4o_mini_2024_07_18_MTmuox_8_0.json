            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, let's break them down logically.\n\n1. The first statement is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This can be interpreted as saying that the sprocket does not necessarily have to be daggled, or in logical terms, it can be represented as \u00acD (not D, where D represents \"the sprocket must have been daggled\").\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as C \u2192 D (if C, then D, where C represents \"the sprocket was cranked\").\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (\u00acC).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can analyze the implications:\n\n- From the second statement (C \u2192 D), if we assume that the sprocket was cranked (C is true), then it must follow that the sprocket was daggled (D is true).\n- However, we know from the first statement that it is not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled (\u00acD is true).\n\nIf D is false (\u00acD is true), then for the conditional C \u2192 D to hold true, C must also be false. This means that if the sprocket was cranked (C) would lead to a contradiction because it would imply that D is true, which we know is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked (\u00acC must be true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
