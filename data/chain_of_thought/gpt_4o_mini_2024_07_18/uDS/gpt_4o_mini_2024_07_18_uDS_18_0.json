We are also given the information that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Since one of the two possibilities (the notebook being on the nightstand) is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
