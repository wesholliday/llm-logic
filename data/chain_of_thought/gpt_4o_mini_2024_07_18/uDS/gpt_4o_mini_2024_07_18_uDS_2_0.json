The book isn't resting on the table.\n\nThe first statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement tells us that one of those conditions (the book resting on the table) is false. \n\nSince the book cannot be resting on the table, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the book must be on the shelf. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
