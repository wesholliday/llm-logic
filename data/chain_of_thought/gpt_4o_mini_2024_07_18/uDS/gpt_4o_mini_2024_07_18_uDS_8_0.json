The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement): \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\" This means at least one of these two conditions must be true. The second statement is a negation: \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\" Since this statement tells us that the second condition (the remote control hiding under the couch) is false, we can conclude that the first condition must be true. Therefore, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
