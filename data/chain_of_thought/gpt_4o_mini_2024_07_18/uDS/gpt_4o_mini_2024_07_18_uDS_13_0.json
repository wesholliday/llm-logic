This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements must be true.\n2. The toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This negates one of the options in the disjunction.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the toy is not on the shelf, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the toy must be in the toy box. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the toy is indeed in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
