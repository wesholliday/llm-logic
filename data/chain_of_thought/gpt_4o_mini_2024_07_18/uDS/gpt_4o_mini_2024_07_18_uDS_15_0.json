The second statement tells us \"the shoes aren't lined up by the door,\" which negates one of the options in the disjunction. Since the shoes cannot be lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes must be in the closet. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes are indeed in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
