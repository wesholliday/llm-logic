This can be expressed as A or B. We are also given the information that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head, which means that statement B is false. \n\nIf B is false, then according to the logical structure of the \"or\" statement (A or B), the only way for the entire statement to remain true is if A is true. Therefore, if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, we can conclude that they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
