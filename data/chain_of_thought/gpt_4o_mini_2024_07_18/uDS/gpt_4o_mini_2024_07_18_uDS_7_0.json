The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet. This means that the second part of the disjunction (B) is false.\n\nIn logical terms, if we have A or B, and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must be true. Therefore, since the umbrella is not in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
