This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of these statements must be true.\n2. The jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This means the second part of the disjunction is false.\n\nSince the second part of the disjunction (the jacket hanging in the closet) is false, the only remaining possibility is that the first part must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
