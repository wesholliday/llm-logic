            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements: \n1. Either the keys are in the drawer (let's call this statement A) or they are dangling in the cabinet (let's call this statement B). This can be expressed as A \u2228 B.\n2. The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet, which means that statement B is false (\u00acB).\n\nGiven that we have A \u2228 B and \u00acB, we can apply the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism. This principle states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true (A). \n\nSince B is false, we can conclude that A must be true. Therefore, the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
