The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\n\nSince we have established from the first statement that the fleeg is not surned, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the fleeg must be bluttered. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" must be true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
