            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the cake was chocolate (C), then the muffins must have been blueberry (B).\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: C \u2192 B.\n2. The second premise states: \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This suggests that it is possible that B is false (\u00acB).\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The cake was not chocolate.\" In logical terms, this is expressed as \u00acC.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the argument using the rules of logic. The first premise (C \u2192 B) indicates that if C is true, then B must also be true. If we accept the second premise (\u00acB), it implies that B is false. \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if B is false (\u00acB), then C must also be false (\u00acC) in order for the first premise to hold true. This is known as modus tollens, which states that if \"if P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion (\u00acC) follows from the premises (C \u2192 B and \u00acB).\n\nAnswer: yes",
