            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n   \n2. The second premise states: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This suggests that Q is false or not necessarily true, which can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - Not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical principle known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- We have \"If P then Q\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt).\n- We also have \"Not Q\" (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nAccording to Modus Tollens, since Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (Not P) is a valid conclusion based on the premises provided.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
