            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n1. If A (the apple is red), then B (the banana is yellow).\n\nThe second premise states, \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This suggests that B is false or not necessarily true. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as:\n\n2. Not B (the banana is not yellow).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can apply a logical principle known as modus tollens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"Not B\" is true, then \"Not A\" must also be true. In this case, if we accept the first premise (If A then B) and the second premise (Not B), we can conclude:\n\n3. Not A (the apple was not red).\n\nThus, the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" logically follows from the premises given. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
