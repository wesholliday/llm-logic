            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n1. If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). \n\nThe second premise states, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" which suggests that it is possible that S is false (Sue was not at the wedding). \n\nNow, if we assume that Sue was not at the wedding (S is false), we can use the first premise. The first premise tells us that if Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then Sue must have been at the wedding (S is true). However, since we are assuming that Sue was not at the wedding (S is false), it follows that Mary cannot be at the wedding either (M must be false). \n\nThis reasoning leads us to conclude that if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary cannot be at the wedding either. Therefore, the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises given. \n\nHowever, the argument is not valid in a strict logical sense because the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. The second premise only states that it is possible for Sue not to be at the wedding, not that she definitely is not. Thus, while the conclusion may be true under certain interpretations, it does not necessarily follow from the premises in all cases.\n\nAnswer: no",
