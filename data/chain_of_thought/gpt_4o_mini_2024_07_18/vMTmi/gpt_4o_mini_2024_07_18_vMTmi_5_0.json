            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy played tennis). \n   - Symbolically, this is P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Amy might not have played tennis.\" This suggests that it is possible that Q is false (i.e., Amy did not play tennis). In logical terms, this can be interpreted as \u00acQ (not Q).\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be represented as \u00acP (not P).\n\nNow, we can analyze the logical structure:\n- From the first premise (P \u2192 Q), if we assume that Q is false (\u00acQ), we can apply the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the first premise is: If not Q (\u00acQ), then not P (\u00acP). \n- Therefore, if we accept \u00acQ (Amy might not have played tennis), we can conclude \u00acP (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
