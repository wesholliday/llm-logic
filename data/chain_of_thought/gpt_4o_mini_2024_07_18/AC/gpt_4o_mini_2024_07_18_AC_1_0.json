            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. However, the reverse is not necessarily true; just because Sue was at the wedding does not imply that Mary was also there. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
