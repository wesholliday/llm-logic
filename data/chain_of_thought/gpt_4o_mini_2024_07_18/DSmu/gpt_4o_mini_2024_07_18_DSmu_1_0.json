            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements: \n\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This negates the second option in the disjunction.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can represent it logically as:\n- A: Fido is inside\n- B: Fido must be in the garden\n- The statement can be expressed as A \u2228 B (A or B).\n\nThe second statement negates B:\n- \u00acB (not B).\n\nNow, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have A \u2228 B and \u00acB, we can conclude A. \n\nSince we have A \u2228 B and \u00acB, we can conclude that A must be true. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
