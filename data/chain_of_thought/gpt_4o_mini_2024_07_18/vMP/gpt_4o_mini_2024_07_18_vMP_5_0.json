            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using the rules of propositional logic. The argument can be represented in symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy played tennis). This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n2. Premise 2: P (Jeff played basketball).\n3. Conclusion: Q (Amy played tennis).\n\nThis argument follows the logical form known as Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true. \n\nIn this case, since both premises are true (the first premise establishes the conditional relationship, and the second premise affirms the antecedent), we can validly conclude that the conclusion (Amy played tennis) must also be true. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
