            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure. The argument follows a common logical form known as modus ponens, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel).\n2. P (The book was written by James).\n3. Therefore, Q (The book is a mystery novel).\n\nIn this case, P is \"the book was written by James,\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" Since the first premise states that if P is true, then Q must also be true, and the second premise confirms that P is indeed true, we can logically conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, the argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
