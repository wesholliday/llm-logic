            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure. The argument follows a common logical form known as modus ponens, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow).\n2. P (The apple was red).\n3. Therefore, Q (The banana was yellow).\n\nIn this case, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" Since the first premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, and the second premise confirms that the apple is indeed red, we can validly conclude that the banana must be yellow. This reasoning is sound and follows the rules of logical deduction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
