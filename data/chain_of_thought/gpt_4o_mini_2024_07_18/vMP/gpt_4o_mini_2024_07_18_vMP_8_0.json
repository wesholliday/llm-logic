            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If P (the vampire was awake), then Q (the mummy was awake). This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n2. Premise 2: P (the vampire was awake).\n3. Conclusion: Q (the mummy was awake).\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical form known as \"modus ponens,\" which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q must also be true. \n\nIn this case, since both premises are true, we can validly conclude that the mummy was awake. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
