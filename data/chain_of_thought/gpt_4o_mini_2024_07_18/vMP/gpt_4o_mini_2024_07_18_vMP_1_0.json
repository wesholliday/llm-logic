            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using the principles of propositional logic. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue was at the wedding (Q). This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n2. Premise 2: Mary was at the wedding (P). This is simply P.\n3. Conclusion: Sue was at the wedding (Q). This is Q.\n\nIn logical terms, this argument follows the form of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true. \n\nSince both premises are true, we can validly conclude that Sue was at the wedding. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
