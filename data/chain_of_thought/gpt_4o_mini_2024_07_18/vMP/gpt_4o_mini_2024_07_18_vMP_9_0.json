            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using the principles of propositional logic. The argument can be represented in symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt). This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n2. Premise 2: P (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n3. Conclusion: Q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nThis argument follows the logical form known as Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true. Since both premises are true, we can validly conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
