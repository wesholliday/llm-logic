            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure. The argument follows a common logical form known as modus ponens, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim).\n2. P (The shirt was cotton).\n3. Therefore, Q (The pants were denim).\n\nIn this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" Since the first premise states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim, and the second premise confirms that the shirt is indeed cotton, we can validly conclude that the pants are denim. This reasoning is sound and follows the rules of logical deduction.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
