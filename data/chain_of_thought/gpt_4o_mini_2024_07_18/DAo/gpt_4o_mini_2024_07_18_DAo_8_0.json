            "content": "Explanation: We start with the two statements provided:\n\n1. \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as: \n- If P (the vampire is awake), then Q (the mummy is awake).\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that \"The vampire was not awake,\" we can denote this as \u00acP (not P). \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not provide any information about Q when P is false (\u00acP). This means that we cannot conclude anything about the state of the mummy (Q) based solely on the fact that the vampire is not awake. The mummy could either be awake or not awake; the information is insufficient to determine its state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The mummy was not awake\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
