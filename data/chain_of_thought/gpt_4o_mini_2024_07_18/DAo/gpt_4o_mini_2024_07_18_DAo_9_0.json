            "content": "Explanation: We start with the two statements provided:\n\n1. \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: \n- If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nIn logical terms, the contrapositive of this statement is also true:\n- If not Q (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), then not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nHowever, we only know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P). The conditional statement does not provide information about the truth of Q when P is false. In other words, just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt does not allow us to conclude anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. Mark could have bought the blue shirt or he could not have; the information is insufficient to make a definitive conclusion about Mark's action.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
