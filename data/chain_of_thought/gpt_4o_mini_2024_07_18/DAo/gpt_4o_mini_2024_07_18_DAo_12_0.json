The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park; it does not provide information about what happens when he does not go. Therefore, Lucy could have gone to the zoo or not gone to the zoo, and we cannot definitively infer that she did not go to the zoo.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
