In logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily follow. This means that we cannot conclude anything about Q (whether the book is a mystery novel or not) based solely on the fact that P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" The book could still be a mystery novel, but it was simply not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
