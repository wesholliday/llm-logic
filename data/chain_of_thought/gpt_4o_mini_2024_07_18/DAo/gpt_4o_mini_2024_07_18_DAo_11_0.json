            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements to analyze:\n\n1. \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as: \n- If P (the cake is chocolate), then Q (the muffins are blueberry).\n\nThe first statement tells us that P is false (the cake is not chocolate). In logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily follow. This means that we cannot conclude anything about Q (the muffins being blueberry) based solely on the fact that P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" The muffins could still be blueberry or they could be of another flavor. \n\nAnswer: no",
