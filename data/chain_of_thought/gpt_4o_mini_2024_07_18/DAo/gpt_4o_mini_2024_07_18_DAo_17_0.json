The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Ben eats pasta; it does not provide information about what happens when he does not eat pasta. \n\nIn logical terms, the statement \"If P then Q\" does not imply \"not Q\" when P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat salad based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
