            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements to analyze:\n\n1. \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: \n- If P (Mary was at the wedding), then Q (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nIn logical terms, this can be represented as:\n- P \u2192 Q\n\nNow, we know from the first statement that Mary was not at the wedding, which means P is false (\u00acP). In logic, a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is only false when the first part (P) is true and the second part (Q) is false. However, if P is false (\u00acP), the conditional statement does not provide any information about Q. \n\nThus, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's attendance at the wedding based solely on the information given. Sue could either be at the wedding or not at the wedding, and we have no way to determine that from the provided statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
