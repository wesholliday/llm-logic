The word \"might\" indicates that there is uncertainty regarding the success of the experiment. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if the experiment could yield groundbreaking results, it also implies that there is a possibility of it being successful. Thus, we can conclude that \"The experiment might be successful\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
