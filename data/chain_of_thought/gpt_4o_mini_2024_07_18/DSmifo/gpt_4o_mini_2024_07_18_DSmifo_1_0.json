This means that the possibility of Fido being inside is open. The second statement gives us two options: either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. Since we have established that Fido might not be in the garden, the only remaining option from the second statement is that Fido must be inside.\n\nThus, we can conclude that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
