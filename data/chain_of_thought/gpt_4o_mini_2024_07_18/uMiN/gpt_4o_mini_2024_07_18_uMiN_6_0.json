            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" suggests that there is a possibility that she did not choose pizza. This implies that there are other options available to her. If it is possible that she did not choose pizza, then it follows that it is also possible that she did choose something else. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that she must have chosen pizza, as the possibility of her choosing something else exists. Thus, we can infer that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
