            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" suggests that there is a possibility that she did not purchase it. This implies uncertainty regarding her action of buying the shirt. If there is a possibility that she did not buy it, then it follows that it is not necessarily true that she must have bought it. In logical terms, if something is possible (in this case, not buying the shirt), it cannot be definitively concluded that it is required (must have bought the shirt). Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
