            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not located in the toy box. This implies uncertainty about the toy's location. However, it does not definitively state that the toy cannot be in the toy box; it simply indicates that it is possible for the toy to be elsewhere. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is absolutely not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, as the possibility remains that it could still be there. \n\nAnswer: no",
