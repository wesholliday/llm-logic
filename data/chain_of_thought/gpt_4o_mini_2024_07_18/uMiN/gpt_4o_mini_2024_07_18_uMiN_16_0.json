The phrase \"might not\" indicates uncertainty, meaning that while it is possible for the pen to be out of the bag, it does not rule out the possibility that the pen could still be in the bag. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is definitively not the case that the pen must be in the bag based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
