            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" suggests that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This implies uncertainty about the griffin's location. If we consider the phrase \"must have been,\" it indicates a stronger assertion that the griffin was definitely in the forest. Since the initial statement allows for the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
