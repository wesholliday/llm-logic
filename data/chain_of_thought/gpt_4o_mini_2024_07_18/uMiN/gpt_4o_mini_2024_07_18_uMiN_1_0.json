            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that she was not present. This implies uncertainty about her attendance. If there is a possibility that she was not there, it logically follows that it is not necessary for her to have been at the wedding. In other words, the phrase \"might not\" indicates that her presence is not guaranteed, which aligns with the conclusion that \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" Therefore, we can infer that it is indeed not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
