            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" indicates that there are two possible methods of delivery: truck or plane. The phrase \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. Therefore, we can rephrase the statement as \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane,\" which maintains the same meaning. Both statements convey that the package was delivered by one of the two methods, and thus we can infer that the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
