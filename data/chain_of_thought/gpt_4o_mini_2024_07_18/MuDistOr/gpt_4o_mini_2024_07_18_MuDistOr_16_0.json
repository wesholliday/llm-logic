            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" indicates that at least one of the two parties (the legal team or the CEO) must have approved the contract for it to be valid. The phrasing suggests that approval from either party is sufficient. Therefore, we can infer that if the contract is valid, it must have been approved by either the legal team or the CEO, which aligns with the rephrased statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO.\" Both statements convey the same meaning regarding the necessity of approval from at least one of the two parties.\n\nAnswer: yes",
