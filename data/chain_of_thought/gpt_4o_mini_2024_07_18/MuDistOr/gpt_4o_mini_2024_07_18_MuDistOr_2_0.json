            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the car. The phrase \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of the two conditions is true. The rephrased statement \"The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop\" maintains the same logical structure and meaning. Both statements imply that the car is either in one location or the other, without changing the essence of the information provided. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
