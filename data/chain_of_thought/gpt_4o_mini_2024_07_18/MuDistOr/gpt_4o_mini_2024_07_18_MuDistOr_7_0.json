            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flight must have been delayed or cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the flight was delayed or it was cancelled. The phrase \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that at least one of the two conditions is true, but it does not exclude the possibility that both could be true at the same time. \n\nWhen we rephrase it as \"The flight must have been delayed or it must have been cancelled,\" we are essentially restating the same two possibilities. The rephrased statement maintains the same meaning as the original, as it still allows for the flight to be either delayed, cancelled, or both. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
