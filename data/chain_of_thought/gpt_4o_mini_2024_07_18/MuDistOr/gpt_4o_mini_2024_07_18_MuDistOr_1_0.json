            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs or under a bed\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the envelope. The phrase \"or\" indicates that at least one of the two conditions is true. When we rephrase it as \"The envelope must have been upstairs or it must have been under a bed,\" we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate clauses, each of which maintains the same meaning. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
