            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or relevant work experience\" implies that having either a degree or relevant work experience is sufficient for the candidate to meet the requirements. This means that if a candidate has a degree, they fulfill the requirement, and if they have relevant work experience, they also fulfill the requirement. The rephrased statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\" maintains the same meaning, as it clearly states that either condition is acceptable. Therefore, we can infer that the candidate must meet at least one of the two criteria.\n\nAnswer: yes",
