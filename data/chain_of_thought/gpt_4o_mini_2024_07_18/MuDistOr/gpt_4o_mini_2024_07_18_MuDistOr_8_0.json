            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" indicates that at least one of the two conditions (signing or notarization) must be true for the document to be valid. The phrase \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that either one or both conditions can be satisfied. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\" because it maintains the same logical structure. Both interpretations convey that at least one of the two actions is necessary for the document's validity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
