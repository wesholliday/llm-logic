            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meal must have included a salad or soup\" presents a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options (salad or soup) must be true for the statement to hold. The rephrased statement \"The meal must have included a salad or it must have included soup\" maintains the same logical structure. Both statements imply that at least one of the two items is included in the meal. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
