            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the keys: either they are in the drawer or they are on the hook. The phrase \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of these conditions is true. When we rephrase it as \"The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook,\" we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate clauses, maintaining the logical structure. Both statements convey the same meaning, affirming that the keys are either in one location or the other. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
