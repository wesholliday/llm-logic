            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book must have been on the shelf or in the backpack\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the book. The phrase \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of the two conditions is true. The rephrased statement \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack\" maintains the same logical structure and meaning. Both statements convey that the book is either in one location or the other, without changing the essence of the information provided. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
