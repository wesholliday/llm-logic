            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wibble must be zizz\" indicates that the wibble is definitively zizz and does not allow for any other possibilities. The inference \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz\" introduces an alternative possibility (wobble) that is not supported by the original statement. Since the original statement does not suggest that the wibble can be anything other than zizz, we cannot conclude that it can also be wobble. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
