The question asks if we can infer that \"The zibber must be bimboozle or fizzle zibber.\" In logical terms, if something is confirmed to be a member of a specific category (in this case, fizzle zibber), it can also be said to belong to a broader category that includes that specific category. Therefore, since the zibber is already confirmed to be a fizzle zibber, it can also be said to be either a bimboozle or a fizzle zibber, as the statement allows for the possibility of being in either category. \n\nAnswer: yes",
