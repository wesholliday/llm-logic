            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked,\" is a disjunction, which means at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The sprocket is not daggled,\" negates one of the options in the disjunction. Since the first statement allows for only two possibilities (daggled or cranked) and we know that the sprocket is not daggled, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket must be cranked. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
