            "content": "Explanation: We start with the first statement, which is a disjunction: \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the splat is quanked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the splat is morphed.\" The second statement tells us that \"The splat is not quanked,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\). \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) and we know that one of the components (in this case \\( P \\)) is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), we can conclude that the other component must be true. This is known as disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, since we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can infer \\( Q \\), which means \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
