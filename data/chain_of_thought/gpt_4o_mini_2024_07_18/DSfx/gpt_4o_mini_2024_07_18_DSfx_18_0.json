The second statement, \"The shank is not nugged,\" eliminates one of the possibilities (the shank being nugged). Since the first statement requires that at least one of the two conditions must hold true and we have established that the shank is not nugged, we can conclude that the other condition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
