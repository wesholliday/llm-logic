            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed\" presents a logical disjunction, which means at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The dreb is not spened,\" negates the first part of the disjunction. Since one part of the disjunction is false, the other part must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
