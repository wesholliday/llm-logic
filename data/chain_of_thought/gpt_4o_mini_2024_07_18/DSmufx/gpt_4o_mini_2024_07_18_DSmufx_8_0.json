            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements:\n\n1. \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: A \u2228 B, where A is \"the sprocket must be daggled\" and B is \"the sprocket is cranked.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\" This can be represented as: \u00acA.\n\nNow, we can apply the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts (A) is false (\u00acA), we can conclude that the other disjunct (B) must be true.\n\nSince we have A \u2228 B and \u00acA, we can conclude that B must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
