            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements: \n\n1. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This is a disjunction, which can be represented as A or B, where A is \"the splat must be quanked\" and B is \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This negates A, which can be represented as \u00acA.\n\nNow, we can apply a logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism. This principle states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the disjuncts (A) is false (\u00acA), we can conclude that the other disjunct (B) must be true.\n\nIn this case, since we have A or B (the first statement) and \u00acA (the second statement), we can conclude that B must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
