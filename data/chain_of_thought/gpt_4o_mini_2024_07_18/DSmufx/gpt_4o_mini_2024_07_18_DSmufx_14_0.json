The first statement (A \u2228 B) tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement (\u00acA) tells us that A is false. \n\nAccording to the logical principle of disjunctive syllogism, if we have A \u2228 B and \u00acA, we can conclude that B must be true. In this case, since A (the clug must be snugged) is false, B (the clug is fleeked) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
