            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements: \n\n1. \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt). \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). In logical terms, if Q is false, then P must also be false for the implication (If P then Q) to hold true. This is based on the principle of contraposition in logic, which states that if an implication is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Q is false), we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
