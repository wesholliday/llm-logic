            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can break them down logically. The first statement, \"The truck was not metal,\" indicates that the truck is made of a material other than metal. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll is indeed plastic, it would lead to the conclusion that the truck must be metal. \n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that \"The truck was not metal,\" we can conclude that the condition of the doll being plastic cannot be true. If the doll were plastic, it would contradict the first statement because it would imply that the truck is metal. Therefore, we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic\" must be true to avoid this contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
