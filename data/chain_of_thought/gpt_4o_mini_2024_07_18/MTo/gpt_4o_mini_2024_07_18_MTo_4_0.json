In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the premise must also be false to keep the statement valid. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, since B is false (the robot did not visit Jupiter), we can conclude that A must also be false (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
