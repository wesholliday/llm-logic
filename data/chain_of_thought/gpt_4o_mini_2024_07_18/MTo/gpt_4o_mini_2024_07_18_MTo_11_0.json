            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements to analyze:\n\n1. \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: \n- If P (the cake is chocolate), then Q (the muffins are blueberry).\n\nWe know from the first statement that Q is false (the muffins are not blueberry). In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the premise must also be false to keep the statement valid. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nSince Q (the muffins are blueberry) is false, we can conclude that P (the cake is chocolate) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
