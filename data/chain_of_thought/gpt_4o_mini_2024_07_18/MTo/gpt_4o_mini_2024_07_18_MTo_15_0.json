            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements to analyze:\n\n1. \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe second statement can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train). In logical notation, this is represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nNow, we know from the first statement that Erin did not take a train, which means Q is false. In logical terms, if Q is false, then for the implication P \u2192 Q to hold true, P must also be false. This is based on the principle of contraposition in logic, which states that if an implication is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since Erin did not take a train (Q is false), we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
