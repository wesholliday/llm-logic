The second statement is a conditional statement that can be interpreted as: if Mary attended the wedding, then it must be true that Sue also attended the wedding. \n\nNow, since we know that Sue did not attend the wedding, the only way for the second statement to hold true is if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is false. In logical terms, if the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) is false, then the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) must also be false to avoid a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
