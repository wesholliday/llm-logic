            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The book is not a mystery novel.' This tells us that the book does not belong to the mystery genre.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' This can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nNow, we know from the first statement that Q is false (the book is not a mystery novel). In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the premise must also be false to keep the conditional statement true. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThus, since Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that 'The book was not written by James.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
