            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"The pants were not denim.\" - This tells us that the pants are made of a material other than denim.\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" - This is a conditional statement. It means that if the shirt is made of cotton, then it must follow that the pants are denim.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that \"The pants were not denim,\" we can use this information in conjunction with the second statement. \n\nIf we assume that the shirt was cotton, then according to the second statement, the pants would have to be denim. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the pants are not denim. Therefore, the assumption that the shirt is cotton must be false.\n\nThus, we can conclude that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
