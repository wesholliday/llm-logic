            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements to analyze:\n\n1. \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the mummy is not awake. The second statement is a conditional statement that tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. \n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these statements. The second statement can be rewritten in logical terms as: \n- If V (vampire is awake), then M (mummy is awake).\n\nSince we know that M is false (the mummy is not awake), we can apply the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive states that if the conclusion is false, then the premise must also be false. In this case, since M is false, it follows that V must also be false. \n\nThus, we can conclude that the vampire is not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
