            "content": "Explanation: We start with the two statements provided:\n\n1. \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement can be interpreted as a conditional statement: if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. \n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" we can conclude that the second part of the conditional statement is false. In logical terms, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the premise must also be false to keep the statement valid. \n\nTherefore, since Jen did not watch basketball, it follows that Tom did not watch football. \n\nThus, we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football\" is true based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
