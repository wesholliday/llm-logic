            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1. \"The truck was not blue.\"\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (the car is red), then Q (the truck is blue). \n\nNow, we know from the first statement that the truck is not blue (\u00acQ). In logical terms, this means Q is false. According to the rules of logic, if Q is false, then P must also be false in order for the conditional statement to hold true. This is known as the contrapositive of the implication, which states that if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since the truck is not blue, we can conclude that the car is not red (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
