            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1. \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy went to the zoo). In logical notation, this is represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nNow, we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ). In logical terms, this means Q is false. \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, particularly the contrapositive, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false (\u00acQ), then the premise must also be false (\u00acP). This means that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThus, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
