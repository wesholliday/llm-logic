            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we have two key pieces of information:\n\n1. \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (the apple is red), then Q (the banana is yellow). \n\nNow, we know from the first statement that the banana is not yellow (\u00acQ). In logical terms, this means Q is false. According to the rules of logic, if Q is false, then P must also be false in order for the conditional statement to hold true. This is known as the contrapositive rule, which states that if \"If P then Q\" is true, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nThus, since we have established that the banana is not yellow (\u00acQ), we can conclude that the apple is not red (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
