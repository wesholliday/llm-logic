            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The first premise can be represented as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the remote control is hiding under the couch.\" The second premise states \\( \\neg Q \\), meaning \"the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\" \n\nFrom these two premises, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( P \\). In this case, since we have established that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table. \n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
