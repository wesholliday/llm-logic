            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden,\" which can be expressed in logical terms as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Fido is inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Fido is in the garden.\" The second premise states \"Fido is not in the garden,\" which can be expressed as \\( \\neg Q \\). \n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and one of the disjuncts is false, we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true. In this case, since we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either Fido is inside or in the garden) and \\( \\neg Q \\) (Fido is not in the garden), we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be true (Fido is inside).\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
