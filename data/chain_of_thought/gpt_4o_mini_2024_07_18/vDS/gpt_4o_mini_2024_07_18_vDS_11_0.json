            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The first premise can be represented as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the newspaper is in the driveway\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the newspaper is sitting on the porch.\" The second premise states \\( \\neg Q \\), meaning \"the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\" \n\nFrom these two premises, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( P \\). In this case, since we have established that the newspaper is not on the porch (\\( \\neg Q \\)), we can conclude that the newspaper must be in the driveway (\\( P \\)). \n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
