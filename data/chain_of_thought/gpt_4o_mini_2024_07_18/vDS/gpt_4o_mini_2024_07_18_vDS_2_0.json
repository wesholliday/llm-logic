            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The first premise can be represented as \\( P \\lor Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"the book is on the shelf\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is resting on the table\"). The second premise states \\( \\neg Q \\) (the book isn't resting on the table). The conclusion we want to reach is \\( P \\) (the book is on the shelf).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism, we can see that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and we know \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, we can conclude \\( P \\) must be true. This means that the argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
