            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true. The second statement, \"The truck might not have been blue,\" suggests that it is possible that the truck is not blue. \n\nIf we assume that the truck is not blue, then the condition of the first statement cannot be satisfied because the truck must be blue if the car is red. Therefore, if the truck is not blue, the car cannot be red. This leads us to conclude that the car was not red.\n\nThus, we can infer that if the truck might not be blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
