            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be represented as: \n\n- If C (the cake is chocolate), then M (the muffins are blueberry).\n\nThe second statement, \"The muffins might not have been blueberry,\" suggests that it is possible that M is false. In logical terms, if M is false (the muffins are not blueberry), then C must also be false to satisfy the first statement. This is because if C were true (the cake was chocolate), then M would have to be true (the muffins would have to be blueberry), which contradicts the possibility that M is false.\n\nTherefore, if we accept that the muffins might not have been blueberry, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
