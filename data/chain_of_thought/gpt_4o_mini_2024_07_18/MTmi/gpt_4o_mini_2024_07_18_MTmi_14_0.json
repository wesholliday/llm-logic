            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This can be represented as: \n\n- If B (bear in the cave) then W (wolf in the den).\n\nThe second statement, \"The wolf might not have been in the den,\" suggests that W is false or uncertain. If W is false, then according to the conditional statement, B must also be false. This is because if the bear were in the cave (B is true), then the wolf would have to be in the den (W would have to be true). Since we have a situation where W might not be true, we can conclude that B must also not be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
