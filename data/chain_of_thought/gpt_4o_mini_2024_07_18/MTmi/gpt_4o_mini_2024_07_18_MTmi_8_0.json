            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake,\" can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- If V (vampire is awake) then M (mummy is awake), or V \u2192 M.\n\nThe second statement, \"The mummy might not have been awake,\" suggests that it is possible that M is false (the mummy is not awake). \n\nNow, if we assume that the mummy is not awake (M is false), we can analyze the first statement. If M is false, then for the implication V \u2192 M to hold true, V must also be false. This is because an implication is only false when the first part (the antecedent) is true and the second part (the consequent) is false. Therefore, if M is false, V must also be false to keep the implication true.\n\nThus, from the two statements, we can conclude that if the mummy might not have been awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
