            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as: \n\n- If P (the doll is plastic), then Q (the truck is metal).\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck might not have been metal,\" suggests that Q is false or uncertain. In logical terms, if Q is false, then P must also be false to satisfy the conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive: if Q is false, then P must also be false. Therefore, if we accept that the truck might not have been metal (which implies Q is false), we can conclude that the doll was not plastic (P is false).\n\nThus, we can infer that the doll was not plastic based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
