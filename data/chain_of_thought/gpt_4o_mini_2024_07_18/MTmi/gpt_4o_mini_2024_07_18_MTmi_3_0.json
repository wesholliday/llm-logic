            "content": "Explanation: We start with the first statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel). \n\nThe second statement is: \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This suggests that it is possible that Q is false (the book is not a mystery novel). \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (the book is not a mystery novel), we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nThus, if we accept that the book might not be a mystery novel (which implies Q is false), we can infer that the book was not written by James (which means P is false). \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the statement \"The book was not written by James\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
