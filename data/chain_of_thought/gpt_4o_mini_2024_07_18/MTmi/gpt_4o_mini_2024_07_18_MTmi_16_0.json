            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" establishes a conditional relationship. This means that if the shirt is indeed cotton, then it logically follows that the pants must be denim. The second statement, \"The pants might not have been denim,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the pants are not denim. If we accept that the pants are not denim, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement to infer that the shirt cannot be cotton. The contrapositive of the first statement is \"If the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\" Since the second statement allows for the possibility that the pants are not denim, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
