            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" is a conditional statement. It implies that Joe's going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. The second statement, \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo,\" suggests that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. \n\nIf we assume that Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the conditional statement implies that Joe could not have gone to the park, because if he had, Lucy would have had to go to the zoo. This is an application of the contrapositive reasoning: if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the premise must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the two statements provided, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
