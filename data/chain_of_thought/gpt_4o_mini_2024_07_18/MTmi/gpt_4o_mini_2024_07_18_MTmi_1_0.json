            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). \n\nThis is a conditional statement. The second statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" suggests that it is possible that S is false (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nNow, if we assume that Sue was not at the wedding (S is false), we can analyze the first statement. The only way for the first statement to hold true is if Mary was also not at the wedding (M must be false) because if M were true, then S would have to be true as well, which contradicts our assumption that S is false.\n\nThus, if we accept that Sue might not have been at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
