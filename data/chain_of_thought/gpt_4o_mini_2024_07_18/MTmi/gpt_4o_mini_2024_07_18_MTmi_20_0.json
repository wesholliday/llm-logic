            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana must have been yellow.\" The second statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" suggests that Q is false or at least not guaranteed to be true. \n\nIn logic, if the premise (P) leads to a conclusion (Q), and we find that Q is not true (or might not be true), we can infer that P must also not be true. This is known as the contrapositive reasoning. Therefore, if we accept that the banana might not have been yellow (which implies Q is false), we can conclude that the apple was not red (which means P is also false).\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The apple was not red\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
