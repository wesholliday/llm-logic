            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball). The second statement, \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" suggests that it is possible that Q is false. In logical terms, this means that Q is not necessarily true. \n\nIf we assume that Q (Jen watched basketball) is false, then according to the first statement, P (Tom watched football) must also be false. This is because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, which contradicts the possibility that Q is false. Therefore, if it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
