According to the rules of logic, if A is true (the alien visited Mars), then R must also be true (the robot visited Jupiter). However, since we have \u00acR (the robot did not visit Jupiter), it follows that A cannot be true. \n\nThis leads us to conclude that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
