            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the griffin was in the forest (G), then the unicorn must have been in the forest (U).\" This can be expressed as G \u2192 U. The second statement is \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest,\" which suggests that U is false or could be false (\u00acU). \n\nIn logical terms, if we have G \u2192 U and we know \u00acU (the unicorn is not in the forest), we can apply the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of G \u2192 U is \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG, which means \"If the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest.\" Since we have \u00acU, we can conclude \u00acG, which means \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nThus, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
