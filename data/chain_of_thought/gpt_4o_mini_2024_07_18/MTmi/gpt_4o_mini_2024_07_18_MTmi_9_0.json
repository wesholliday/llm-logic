            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be understood as a conditional statement: if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" suggests that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. \n\nIf we assume that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the condition set by the first statement cannot be satisfied. This means that the only way for the first statement to hold true is if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can conclude that if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it logically follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
