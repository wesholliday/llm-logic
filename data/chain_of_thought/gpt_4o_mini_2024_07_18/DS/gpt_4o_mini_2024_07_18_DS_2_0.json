            "content": "Explanation: The first statement presents a logical disjunction: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\" This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement asserts that \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" which negates one of the options in the disjunction. Since the book cannot be resting on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book must be on the shelf. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
