The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement) that states at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the flug is not zimmed, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the flug must be blummed. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The flug is blummed\" must be true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
