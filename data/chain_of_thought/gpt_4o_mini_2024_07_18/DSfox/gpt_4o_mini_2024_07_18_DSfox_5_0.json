The second statement is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the zinger is not smoogled, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the zinger must be fraggled. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The zinger is fraggled\" is a valid inference based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
