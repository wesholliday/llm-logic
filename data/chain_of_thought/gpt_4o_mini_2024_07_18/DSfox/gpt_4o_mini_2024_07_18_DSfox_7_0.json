The second premise presents a logical disjunction (either/or statement) where one of the two conditions must be true: either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\n\nSince we have established that the whiffle is not tinked, the only remaining possibility from the second premise is that the whiffle must be shanked. Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The whiffle is shanked\" must be true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
