The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the shank is not nugged, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the shank must be plooked. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the shank is indeed plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
