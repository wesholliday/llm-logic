            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we have two premises:\n\n1. \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n2. \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\"\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the sprocket is definitely not daggled. This means that the first part of the second premise (\"the sprocket is daggled\") is false. \n\nThe second premise is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which states that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. Since we have established that the first condition (the sprocket being daggled) is false, the only way for the disjunction to hold true is if the second condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
