            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we have two premises:\n\n1. \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n2. \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"\n\nThe first statement tells us that the splat is definitely not in the state of being quanked. The second statement presents a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the splat is not quanked, we can eliminate that possibility. Therefore, the only remaining option from the disjunction is that the splat must be morphed. \n\nThus, we can conclude that \"The splat is morphed\" is indeed a valid inference from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
