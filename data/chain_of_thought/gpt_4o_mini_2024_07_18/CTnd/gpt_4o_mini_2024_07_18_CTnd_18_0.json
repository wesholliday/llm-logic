            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the issue was discussed\" and B is \"it was not discussed in depth.\" This means that if the issue was discussed (A is true), then it follows that it was not discussed in depth (B is true). \n\nTo analyze the proposed inference, \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed,\" we can rephrase it as \"If C, then D,\" where C is \"the issue was discussed in depth\" and D is \"it was not discussed.\" \n\nHowever, the original statement does not support this inference. The original statement implies that discussing the issue means it cannot be discussed in depth, but it does not provide a direct relationship that allows us to conclude that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed at all. In fact, if the issue was discussed in depth, it contradicts the original statement, which states that if it was discussed, it was not discussed in depth.\n\nThus, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
