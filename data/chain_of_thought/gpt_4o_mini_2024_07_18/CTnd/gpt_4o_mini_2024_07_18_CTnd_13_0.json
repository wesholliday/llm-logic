            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Alex exercised\" and Q is \"Alex exercised much.\" This means that if Alex did exercise, it implies that the extent of his exercise was not significant (not much).\n\nNow, we need to analyze the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This can be expressed as \"If Q, then not P.\" This is a different logical structure. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Alex exercised much (Q). In fact, the original statement only tells us about the scenario when he exercised (P) and its relation to exercising much (Q). \n\nTo determine if \"If Q, then not P\" can be inferred from \"If P, then not Q,\" we can consider the logical implications. The original statement does not imply that exercising much (Q) leads to not exercising (not P). In fact, it is possible for someone to exercise much while still exercising. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
