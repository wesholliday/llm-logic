            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"A \u2192 \u00acB\", where A is \"the issue was addressed\" and B is \"the issue was addressed effectively\". This means that if A is true (the issue was addressed), then B must be false (it was not addressed effectively).\n\nNow, we need to analyze the statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\". This can be expressed as \"B \u2192 \u00acA\". This is a different logical implication. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"B \u2192 \u00acA\" from \"A \u2192 \u00acB\", we can use the concept of contraposition. The contrapositive of \"A \u2192 \u00acB\" is \"B \u2192 \u00acA\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince we have established that the original statement implies its contrapositive, we can conclude that \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
