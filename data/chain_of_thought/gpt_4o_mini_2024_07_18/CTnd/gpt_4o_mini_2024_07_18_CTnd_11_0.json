            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"I went to the store\" and Q is \"I bought vegetables.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If I bought vegetables (Q), then I did not go to the store (not P).\" In logic, the contrapositive is always equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
