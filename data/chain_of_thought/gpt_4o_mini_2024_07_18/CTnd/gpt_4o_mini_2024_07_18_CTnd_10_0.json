            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" can be interpreted as saying that whenever advice is given, it lacks helpfulness. This does not directly imply that if helpful advice was offered, then no advice was offered at all. The statement does not provide a direct relationship between the helpfulness of advice and the offering of advice itself. In fact, it suggests that if advice is offered, it is inherently unhelpful, but it does not rule out the possibility of helpful advice being offered in a different context or situation. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the statement \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
