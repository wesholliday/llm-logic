The first statement indicates that there is a possibility that \"the snork\" is \"plimp.\" However, it does not provide any information about \"the snork\" being \"zibble.\" The introduction of \"zibble\" in the second statement is not supported by the first statement, as it does not imply that \"the snork\" can be both \"zibble\" and \"plimp.\" Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
