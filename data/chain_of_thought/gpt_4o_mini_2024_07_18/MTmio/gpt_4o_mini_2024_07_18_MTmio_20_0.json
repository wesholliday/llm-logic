            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, let's break them down logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the banana is not yellow. This does not confirm that the banana is definitely not yellow, but it opens the possibility.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple is indeed red, then it follows that the banana has to be yellow.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If we assume that the apple was red, then according to the second statement, the banana must be yellow.\n- However, the first statement suggests that the banana might not be yellow. This creates a contradiction because if the apple were red, the banana would have to be yellow, but the first statement allows for the possibility that it is not.\n\nSince assuming the apple is red leads to a contradiction with the first statement, we can conclude that the apple cannot be red. Therefore, we can infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
