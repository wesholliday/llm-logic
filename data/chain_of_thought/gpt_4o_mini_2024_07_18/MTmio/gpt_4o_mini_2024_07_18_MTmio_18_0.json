            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the statements given. The first statement, \"The truck might not have been metal,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the truck is not made of metal. The second statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" is a conditional statement that indicates that the only way for the truck to be metal is if the doll is plastic. \n\nNow, if we assume that the doll was plastic, then according to the second statement, the truck must be metal. However, the first statement indicates that the truck might not be metal, which creates a contradiction if we assume the doll is plastic. Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the doll cannot be plastic. \n\nThus, we can infer that the doll was not plastic based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
