            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, let's break them down logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" suggests that it is possible that Sue was not present at the wedding. This does not confirm her absence but allows for the possibility.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. It means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. \n\nNow, if we assume that Sue was not at the wedding (which is a possibility from the first statement), we can use the second statement to draw a conclusion about Mary. If Sue is not at the wedding, then the condition \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" cannot hold true. Therefore, for the conditional statement to remain valid, Mary cannot be at the wedding either. \n\nThus, if we accept the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
