            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements provided:\n\n1. \"The mummy might not have been awake\" suggests that there is a possibility that the mummy is not awake, but it does not confirm it definitively.\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" is a conditional statement. This means that the only way for the first part (the vampire being awake) to be true is if the second part (the mummy being awake) is also true.\n\nNow, if we assume that the mummy is indeed not awake (which is a possibility from the first statement), we can analyze the implications of the second statement. If the mummy is not awake, then the condition for the vampire being awake cannot be satisfied. Therefore, the vampire cannot be awake either, because if it were, the mummy would have to be awake as well.\n\nThus, from the two statements, we can conclude that if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire must also not be awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
