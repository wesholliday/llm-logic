            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, let's break them down logically.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This suggests that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not confirm it.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nNow, if we assume that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (which is a possibility from the first statement), we can analyze the implications of the second statement. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the condition of the second statement cannot be satisfied if Lisa had bought the red shirt. Therefore, for the second statement to hold true, Lisa cannot have bought the red shirt.\n\nThus, from the two statements, we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
