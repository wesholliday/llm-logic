            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zibble might be frobbed and quorked\" suggests that there are two possibilities regarding the zibble: it might be frobbed and it might be quorked. The use of \"and\" indicates that both conditions could potentially be true at the same time. However, the phrase \"might be\" implies that these are not certainties but rather possibilities. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that if the zibble might be frobbed and quorked, it is indeed possible that the zibble might be quorked on its own, regardless of whether it is frobbed or not. The presence of \"might be\" allows for the possibility of just one of the conditions being true. Therefore, we can conclude that it is valid to infer \"The zibble might be quorked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
