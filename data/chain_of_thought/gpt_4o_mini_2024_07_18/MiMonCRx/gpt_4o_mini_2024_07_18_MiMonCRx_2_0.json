            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The quibble might be snorked and wumbled\" suggests that the quibble has the potential to be both snorked and wumbled. The use of \"might be\" indicates that it is possible for the quibble to be wumbled, as it is one of the two actions mentioned. Since \"wumbled\" is included in the phrase, we can infer that it is indeed possible for the quibble to be wumbled, regardless of whether it is also snorked or not. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement \"The quibble might be wumbled\" is a valid inference from the original phrase.\n\nAnswer: yes",
