            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can break them down logically. The first statement, \"The splat did not quank,\" indicates that the splat did not perform the action of quanking. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This means that if the splat was indeed morphed, it would have quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements together. The second statement can be rewritten in logical terms as: \n\n- If P (the splat was morphed), then Q (the splat quanked).\n\nThe first statement tells us that Q is false (the splat did not quank). In logical terms, if Q is false, then P must also be false to satisfy the conditional statement. This is known as modus tollens, which states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since we know that the splat did not quank, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
