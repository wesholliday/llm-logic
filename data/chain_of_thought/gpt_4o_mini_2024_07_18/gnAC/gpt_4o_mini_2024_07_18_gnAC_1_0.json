            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. The truth of this statement does not imply that P (Mary was at the wedding) must be true if Q (Sue was at the wedding) is true. In fact, the conditional statement only tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must be there as well. However, it does not provide any information about Mary's presence if Sue is present. Therefore, even though we know Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary was also there based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
