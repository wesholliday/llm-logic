            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented in logical terms as \"V \u2192 M\", where V is \"the vampire was awake\" and M is \"the mummy was awake\". This is a conditional statement. The second statement \"The mummy was awake\" can be represented as \"M is true\". \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is only false when the first part (the antecedent) is true and the second part (the consequent) is false. In this case, since we know that M is true, we cannot conclude anything definitive about V. The vampire could be awake or it could be asleep; the truth of M does not provide information about the truth of V. \n\nThus, it does not necessarily follow that \"The vampire was awake\" is true based solely on the information given. \n\nAnswer: no",
