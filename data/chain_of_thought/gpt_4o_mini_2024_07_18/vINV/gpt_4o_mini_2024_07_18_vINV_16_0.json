            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" which can be represented in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This form is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original implication. However, the conclusion presented is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of an implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not logically valid. The original statement does not guarantee that if the shirt is not cotton, the pants cannot be denim. For example, the pants could be made of a different material, such as polyester, while the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
