            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This form is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original implication. However, the conclusion presented is not the contrapositive but rather a different implication.\n\nTo check the validity, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about the case when \\( P \\) is false (the apple is not red). The conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) suggests that if the apple is not red, then the banana cannot be yellow, which is not necessarily true based on the premise. \n\nFor example, if the apple is not red (let's say it is green), the banana could still be yellow, which would contradict the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
