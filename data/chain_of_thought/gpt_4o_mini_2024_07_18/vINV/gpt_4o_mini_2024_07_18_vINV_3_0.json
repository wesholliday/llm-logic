            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented can be analyzed using the principles of logic, specifically the rules of implication. The premise states, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The conclusion states, \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we can apply the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise; instead, it is a different statement that does not follow from the premise.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider a scenario where the book was written by someone other than James, but it is still a mystery novel. In this case, \\( \\neg P \\) is true (the book was not written by James), but \\( Q \\) could still be true (the book is a mystery novel). This would make the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) false, demonstrating that the argument is not valid.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
