            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Amy played tennis.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This form is known as the contrapositive, which states that if the original implication is true, then its contrapositive is also true. However, the conclusion presented here is not the contrapositive of the premise; rather, it is the inverse.\n\nThe inverse of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not logically valid. The truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. For example, it is possible for Jeff not to play basketball (making \\( \\neg P \\) true) while Amy still plays tennis (making \\( Q \\) true), which would make the conclusion false.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
