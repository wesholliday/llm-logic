            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck was metal (M),\" which can be expressed in logical terms as P \u2192 M. The conclusion states, \"If the doll was not plastic (\u00acP), then the truck was not metal (\u00acM),\" which can be expressed as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acM.\n\nThis form of reasoning is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The original premise does not provide sufficient information to conclude that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck cannot be metal. In fact, the truck could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThus, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
