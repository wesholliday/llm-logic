            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion using logical implications. The premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q).\" This can be expressed in logical terms as P \u2192 Q. The conclusion states: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acQ),\" which can be expressed as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThis form of reasoning is known as the inverse, which is not logically valid. The original implication (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee that the inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is true. For example, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP) while Mark still bought the blue shirt (Q), which would make the conclusion false even if the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not ensure the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
