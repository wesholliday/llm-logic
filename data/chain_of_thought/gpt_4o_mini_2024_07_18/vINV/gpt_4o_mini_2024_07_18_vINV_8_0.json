            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion using logical implications. The premise states: \"If the vampire was awake (V), then the mummy was awake (M)\", which can be expressed as V \u2192 M. The conclusion states: \"If the vampire was not awake (\u00acV), then the mummy was not awake (\u00acM)\", which can be expressed as \u00acV \u2192 \u00acM.\n\nThis form of reasoning is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of V \u2192 M is \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV, not \u00acV \u2192 \u00acM. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premise. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example: If the premise is true (the vampire is awake implies the mummy is awake), it does not necessarily mean that if the vampire is not awake, the mummy must also not be awake. The mummy could still be awake regardless of the vampire's state.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
