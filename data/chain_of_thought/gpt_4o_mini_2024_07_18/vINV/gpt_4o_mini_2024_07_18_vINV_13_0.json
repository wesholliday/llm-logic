            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which can be represented in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This form is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original implication. However, the conclusion presented is not the contrapositive but rather a different implication.\n\nTo check the validity, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about the case when \\( P \\) is false (the car is not red). It is possible for the truck to be blue or not blue regardless of the color of the car. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nThus, the argument is not valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
