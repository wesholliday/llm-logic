            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This form is known as the contrapositive, which states that if the original implication is true, then its contrapositive is also true. However, the conclusion presented here is not the contrapositive of the premise; rather, it is a different statement.\n\nTo check the validity, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee that if \\( P \\) is false (Tom did not watch football), \\( Q \\) must also be false (Jen did not watch basketball). There are scenarios where Tom does not watch football, but Jen could still watch basketball, making the conclusion false while the premise remains true.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
