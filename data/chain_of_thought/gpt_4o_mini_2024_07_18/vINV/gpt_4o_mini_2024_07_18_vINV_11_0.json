            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion. The premise states, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" which can be represented in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This form is known as the contrapositive, which states that if the original implication is true, then its contrapositive is also true. However, the conclusion presented is not the contrapositive of the premise; rather, it is a different statement that does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example: If the cake is chocolate (true), then the muffins are blueberry (true). However, if the cake is not chocolate (false), it does not necessarily mean that the muffins are not blueberry (false). The muffins could still be blueberry or of another flavor. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThus, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
