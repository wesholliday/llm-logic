            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be represented in logical terms as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) (where \\( M \\) is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The conclusion states, \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nThis form of reasoning is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the conclusion presented here is not the contrapositive of the original premise. Instead, it is a different statement that does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example: If Mary was at the wedding (true), it does not necessarily mean that if Mary was not at the wedding (false), Sue was also not at the wedding (false). Sue could have been at the wedding regardless of Mary's presence.\n\nThus, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
