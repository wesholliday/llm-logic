The first statement contains two parts: 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk' and 'it must snork zooble wozzle'. The second statement combines these two parts into one coherent statement by removing the pronoun 'it' and directly linking the two clauses. Since the first statement logically leads to the second by simply rephrasing and combining the ideas without changing their meaning, we can conclude that the second statement is indeed a valid inference from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
