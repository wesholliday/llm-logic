            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk.\" This can be broken down into two parts: \"The quorple must be at snork gribble\" and \"it must be in the wibble plonk.\" The phrase \"and it must be\" indicates that both conditions are required for the quorple. \n\nWhen we rephrase the statement to \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk,\" we are essentially combining the two conditions into one sentence. The meaning remains the same; both conditions are still required for the quorple. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
