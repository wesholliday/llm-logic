From the first statement, we have two possibilities: either Fido is inside (Fido_inside) or he is in the garden (Fido_garden). The second statement tells us that Fido is not in the garden (\u00acFido_garden). \n\nSince we know that Fido cannot be in the garden (\u00acFido_garden), the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that Fido must be inside (Fido_inside). Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
