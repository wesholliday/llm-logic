            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements: \n\n1. Either the book is on the shelf (let's call this statement A) or it must be resting on the table (let's call this statement B). This can be expressed as A \u2228 B.\n2. It is not the case that the book must be resting on the table, which can be expressed as \u00acB.\n\nNow, we can apply logical reasoning. From the first statement (A \u2228 B), we know that at least one of the statements A or B must be true. The second statement (\u00acB) tells us that B is false. \n\nIf B is false, then the only option left for the first statement (A \u2228 B) to hold true is for A to be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf (A is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
