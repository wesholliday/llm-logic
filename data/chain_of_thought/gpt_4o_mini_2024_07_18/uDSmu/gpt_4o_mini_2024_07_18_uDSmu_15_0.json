The second statement tells us \"it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door,\" which negates the second part of the disjunction. \n\nSince the second condition (shoes lined up by the door) is false, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the shoes must be in the closet. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes are indeed in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
