            "content": "Explanation: The original statement indicates that the concert \"might be sold out and feature a famous band.\" The phrase \"might feature a famous band\" is included in the original statement as a possibility. Therefore, if the concert might be sold out and also might feature a famous band, we can indeed infer that there is a possibility that the concert features a famous band.
