The phrase \"might be successful\" indicates uncertainty about the success of the experiment, but it does not negate the possibility of yielding groundbreaking results if it is successful. Therefore, we can infer that \"The experiment might yield groundbreaking results\" is a valid conclusion, as it is a subset of the original statement's possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
