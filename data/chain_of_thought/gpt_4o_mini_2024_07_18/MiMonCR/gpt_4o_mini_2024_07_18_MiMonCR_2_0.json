            "content": "Explanation: The original statement indicates that the recipe \"might be complicated and require exotic ingredients.\" This implies that the requirement for exotic ingredients is a possibility. If something \"might\" require exotic ingredients, it logically follows that it can be stated that \"the recipe might require exotic ingredients.\" The phrase \"might be complicated\" does not negate the possibility of requiring exotic ingredients; rather, it suggests that both aspects could be true. Therefore, we can infer that the recipe might require exotic ingredients based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
