            "content": "Explanation: The original statement indicates that the book has the potential to be a bestseller and also suggests that it might be adapted into a movie. If the book is indeed a bestseller, it increases the likelihood of it being adapted into a movie, but the phrase \"might be a bestseller and adapted into a movie\" implies that both outcomes are possibilities. Therefore, if the book might be a bestseller and is mentioned as potentially being adapted into a movie, we can infer that it is indeed possible for the book to be adapted into a movie, regardless of its bestseller status. \n\nAnswer: yes",
