            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" suggests that there is no necessity for the milk to be on the counter. This implies that it is possible for the milk to be located elsewhere. The phrase \"the milk might not be on the counter\" aligns with this interpretation, as it indicates a possibility rather than a certainty. Therefore, we can infer that if the milk does not have to be on the counter, it is indeed possible that it is not there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
