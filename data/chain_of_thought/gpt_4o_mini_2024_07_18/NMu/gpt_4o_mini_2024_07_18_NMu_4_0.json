            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" suggests that it is not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars. This implies that there are possibilities where the alien did not visit Mars. The phrase \"the alien might not have visited Mars\" aligns with this interpretation, as it indicates that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we can infer that if it is not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars, then it is indeed possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
