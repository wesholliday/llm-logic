            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" implies that it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza. This suggests that there are other possibilities regarding her choice. The phrase \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" indicates that it is possible for her not to have chosen pizza, which aligns with the idea that her choosing pizza is not a certainty. Therefore, if it is not the case that she must have chosen pizza, it logically follows that she might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
