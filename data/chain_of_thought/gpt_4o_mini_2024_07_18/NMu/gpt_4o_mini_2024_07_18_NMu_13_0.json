            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be in the toy box. This suggests that while the toy could be in the toy box, it is not required to be there. Therefore, it opens up the possibility that the toy might not be in the toy box. The phrase \"the toy might not be in the toy box\" aligns with this interpretation, as it indicates that the toy could be located elsewhere. Thus, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
