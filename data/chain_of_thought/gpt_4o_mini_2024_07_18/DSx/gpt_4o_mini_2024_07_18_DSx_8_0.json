            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled\" is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The sprocket is not daggled,\" eliminates one of the possibilities in the disjunction. Since the sprocket cannot be daggled, the only remaining option is that the sprocket must be cranked. Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The sprocket is cranked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
