The second statement, \"The whiffle is not tinked,\" negates one of the options in the disjunction. Since the whiffle cannot be tinked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle must be shanked. Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The whiffle is shanked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
