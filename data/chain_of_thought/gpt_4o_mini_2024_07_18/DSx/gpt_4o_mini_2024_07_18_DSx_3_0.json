            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked,\" is a disjunction, which means at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The splat is not quanked,\" negates one of the options in the disjunction. Since the splat cannot be quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat must be morphed. Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The splat is morphed\" is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
