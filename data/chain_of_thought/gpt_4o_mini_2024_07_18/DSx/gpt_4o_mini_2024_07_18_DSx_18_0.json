The second statement, \"The shank is not nugged,\" eliminates one of the possibilities in the disjunction. Since the only other option left is that the shank is plooked, we can conclude that the shank must indeed be plooked. Therefore, we can infer \"The shank is plooked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
