            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as A \u2192 C, where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\" This means that if A is true, then C must also be true. However, the contrapositive of this statement is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race,\" can be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acC. This is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In fact, it is possible for Alex to not finish the race while Chris still finishes the race. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Alex didn't finish, then Chris also didn't finish.\n\nAnswer: no",
