            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\"). The logical form of this statement does not allow us to directly infer the contrapositive \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" (which would be \"If not P, then not Q\"). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is equivalent to the original statement, but the inverse (which is what we are trying to infer here) is not necessarily true. The original statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red; it does not provide information about what happens when the apple is not red. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the apple is not red, the banana is also not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
