            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake,\" we need to consider the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement does not provide information about what happens when the vampire is not awake. In logical terms, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake,\" which is valid. However, the statement we are trying to infer is not the contrapositive but rather a new conditional statement that cannot be derived from the original.\n\nIn summary, the original statement does not imply that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is also not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
