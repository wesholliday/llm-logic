            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the second statement \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside,\" we can express it as \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are examining is not the contrapositive but rather a different conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement does not provide information about what happens when the dog is not inside. It is possible for the dog to be outside while the cat is still outside or inside. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the dog is not inside, the cat must also not be outside. \n\nThus, the inference \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
