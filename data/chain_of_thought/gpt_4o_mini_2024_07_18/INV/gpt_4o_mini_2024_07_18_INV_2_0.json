            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be represented in logical terms as \"G \u2192 U\", where G is \"the griffin is in the forest\" and U is \"the unicorn is in the forest\". This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" (\u00acG \u2192 \u00acU), we need to consider the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement does not provide information about what happens when the griffin is not in the forest. In logical terms, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest\" (\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG), which is valid. However, the statement we are trying to infer (\u00acG \u2192 \u00acU) is not a valid conclusion from the original statement. \n\nThus, we cannot infer that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn is also not in the forest. \n\nAnswer: no",
