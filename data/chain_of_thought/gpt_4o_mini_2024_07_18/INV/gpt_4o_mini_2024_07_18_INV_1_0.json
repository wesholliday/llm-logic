            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nHowever, the statement does not provide information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding (not P). The logical form of the original statement does not imply the contrapositive, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\" (if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding). \n\nThe statement also does not imply that if Mary is not at the wedding, then Sue is also not at the wedding. There could be scenarios where Mary is absent, but Sue could still be present. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
