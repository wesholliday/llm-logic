            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\"). This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the inference \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" we can express it as \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is known as the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we have is not the contrapositive; it is a different logical form known as the inverse. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. \n\nIn this case, just because Joe did not go to the park does not provide any information about whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
