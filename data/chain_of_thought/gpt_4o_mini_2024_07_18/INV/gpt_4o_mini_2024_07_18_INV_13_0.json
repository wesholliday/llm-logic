            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The logical form of this statement does not allow us to infer the contrapositive directly. The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red,\" which is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer, \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not provide information about what happens when the car is not red. The truth of the truck being blue is only guaranteed when the car is red, but if the car is not red, the truck could still be blue or not blue. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
