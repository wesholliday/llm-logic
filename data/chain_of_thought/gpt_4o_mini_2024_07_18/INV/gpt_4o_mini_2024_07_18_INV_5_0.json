            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the second statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" we can express it as \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are examining is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse.\n\nThe inverse of the original statement is \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In fact, it is possible for Jeff not to play basketball while Amy still plays tennis. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
