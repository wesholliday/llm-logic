            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be represented in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the doll is plastic\" and \\( M \\) is \"the truck is metal.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" we need to analyze the logical structure. The statement we want to infer can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which would be \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). \n\nHowever, the original statement does not imply that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck cannot be metal. The truck could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
