            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The logical form of this statement does not allow us to infer the contrapositive directly. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which means \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" \n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which is not a valid conclusion from the original statement. This is a common logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
