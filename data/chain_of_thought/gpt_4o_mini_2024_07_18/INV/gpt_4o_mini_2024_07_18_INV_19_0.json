            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the second statement \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball,\" we can express it as \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which states that if the first part (P) is false, then the second part (Q) must also be false. However, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, while the inverse (which is what the second statement represents) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. \n\nAnswer: no",
