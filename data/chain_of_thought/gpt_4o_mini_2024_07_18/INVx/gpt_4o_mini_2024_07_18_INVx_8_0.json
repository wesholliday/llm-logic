            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled,\" we need to consider the logical structure of the original statement. The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are trying to infer is not the contrapositive; it is a different form known as the inverse.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
