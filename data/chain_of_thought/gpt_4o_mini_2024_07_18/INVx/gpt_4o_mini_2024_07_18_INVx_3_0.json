            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank,\" we need to analyze the logical structure. The statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not provide information about what happens when P is false (i.e., when the splat is not morphed). It is possible for the splat to not be morphed and still quank, or it could not quank. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
