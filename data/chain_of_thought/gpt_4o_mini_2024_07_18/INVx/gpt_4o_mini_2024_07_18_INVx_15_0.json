            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened\"). The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\" (or \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\"). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Since we are given the original statement, we can indeed infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
