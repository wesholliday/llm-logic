            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip lupped the zoint\"). The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\" (if the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. \n\nSince we are given the original statement, we can indeed infer the contrapositive. Thus, we can conclude that the statement \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
