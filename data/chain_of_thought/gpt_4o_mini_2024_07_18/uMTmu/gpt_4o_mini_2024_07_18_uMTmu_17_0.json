In logical terms, this can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we have established that Q (Kate ate salad) is false, we can conclude that P (Ben ate pasta) must also be false. \n\nThus, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
