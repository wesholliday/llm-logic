            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" can be interpreted as a conditional statement: M \u2192 S, where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The second part of the question states, \"it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" which can be interpreted as \u00acS (Sue was not at the wedding). \n\nUsing logical reasoning, if we assume that Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then according to the conditional statement, Sue must also be at the wedding (S must be true). However, we have established that Sue is not at the wedding (\u00acS is true). This creates a contradiction because both M and S cannot be true at the same time if \u00acS is true. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that Mary cannot be at the wedding (M must be false). \n\nThus, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
