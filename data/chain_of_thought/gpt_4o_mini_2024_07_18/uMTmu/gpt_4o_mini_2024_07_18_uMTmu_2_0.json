From the first statement (G \u2192 U), if we know that U is false (\u00acU), we can use the contrapositive of the implication. The contrapositive of G \u2192 U is \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG, which means \"if the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest.\"\n\nSince we have established that \u00acU is true (the unicorn is not in the forest), we can conclude that \u00acG must also be true (the griffin is not in the forest).\n\nThus, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
