            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\" The second part of the statement says \"it's not the case that the truck must have been metal,\" which can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can conclude \"not P\" must also be true. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we have established that the truck was not metal (not Q), we can infer that the doll was not plastic (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
