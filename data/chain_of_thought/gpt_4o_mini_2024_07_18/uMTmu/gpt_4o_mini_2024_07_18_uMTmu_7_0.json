            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" can be interpreted as a conditional statement: A \u2192 C, where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race.\" The second part of the question states \"it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race,\" which can be expressed as \u00acC (Chris did not finish the race). \n\nUsing the logic of implications, if we have A \u2192 C and we know \u00acC (Chris did not finish), we can apply the contrapositive of the implication. The contrapositive of A \u2192 C is \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA, which means if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex also did not finish the race. Since we have \u00acC, we can conclude \u00acA, meaning Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
