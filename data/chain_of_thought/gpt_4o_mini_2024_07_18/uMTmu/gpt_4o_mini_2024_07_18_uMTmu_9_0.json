            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second part of the statement says \"it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" which can be interpreted as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, we can conclude that \"not P\" must also be true. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we have established that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q), we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
