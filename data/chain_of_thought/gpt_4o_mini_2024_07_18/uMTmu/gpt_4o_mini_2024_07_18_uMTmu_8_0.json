From the first statement (V \u2192 M), if we know that M is false (\u00acM), we can use the contrapositive of the implication. The contrapositive of V \u2192 M is \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV, which means \"If the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake.\"\n\nSince we have established that \u00acM is true (the mummy is not awake), we can conclude that \u00acV must also be true (the vampire is not awake).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
