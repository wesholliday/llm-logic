            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The second part of the statement says \"it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball,\" which can be expressed as \"not Q.\" In logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
