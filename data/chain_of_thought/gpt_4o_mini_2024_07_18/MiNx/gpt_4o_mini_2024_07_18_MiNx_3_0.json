            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The splat might not have been morphed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed. This implies that it is not certain that the splat was morphed, but it does not definitively state that it cannot be morphed. The phrase \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" indicates that there is no necessity for the splat to have been morphed, which aligns with the idea that it might not have been morphed. Therefore, we can infer that if it is possible for the splat to not be morphed, then it is also true that it is not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
