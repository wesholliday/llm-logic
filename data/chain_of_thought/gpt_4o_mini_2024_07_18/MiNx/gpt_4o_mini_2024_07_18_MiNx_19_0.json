            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\" suggests a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled, indicating that there is at least one scenario where the smonk is not vreebled. This does not directly imply that it is impossible for the smonk to have been vreebled; rather, it leaves open the possibility that the smonk could have been vreebled in some other scenarios. Therefore, the statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" can be inferred from the original statement, as the possibility of the smonk not being vreebled suggests that it is not a necessity for the smonk to have been vreebled. \n\nAnswer: yes",
