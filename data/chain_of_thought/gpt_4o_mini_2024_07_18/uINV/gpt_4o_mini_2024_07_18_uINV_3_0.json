            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The original statement does not provide information about books not written by James; it only specifies what happens if the book is written by him. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the book was not written by James, it cannot be a mystery novel, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nThus, the inference that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel is not valid based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
