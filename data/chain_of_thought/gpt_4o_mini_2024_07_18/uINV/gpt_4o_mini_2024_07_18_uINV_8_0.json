            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the vampire is awake\" and B is \"the mummy is awake\"). This is a conditional statement. However, the question asks if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" (not A implies not B). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement given does not allow us to infer the contrapositive directly. The original statement only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake, but it does not provide information about the situation when the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the vampire is not awake, the mummy is also not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
