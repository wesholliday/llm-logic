The banana could still be yellow or it could be of another color. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the apple is not red, the banana is also not yellow. \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not imply its contrapositive. Thus, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
