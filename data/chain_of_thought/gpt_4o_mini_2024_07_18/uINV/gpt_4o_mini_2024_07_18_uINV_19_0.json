            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the contrapositive, we need to consider the opposite scenario: \"If Tom did not watch football (not P), then Jen did not watch basketball (not Q).\" However, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football. In logic, the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its contrapositive. \n\nIn simpler terms, just because Tom did not watch football does not mean that Jen did not watch basketball. She could have watched basketball regardless of whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
