This is a conditional statement. However, the question asks if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement given does not provide information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It is possible for Sue to be at the wedding even if Mary is not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Mary is not at the wedding, then Sue is also not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
