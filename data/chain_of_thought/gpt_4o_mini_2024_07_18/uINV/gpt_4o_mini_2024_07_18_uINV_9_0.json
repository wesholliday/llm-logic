            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the contrapositive, we need to consider the opposite scenario: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q).\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we have is not the contrapositive; it is a different assertion.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. It is possible for Mark to still buy the blue shirt even if Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
