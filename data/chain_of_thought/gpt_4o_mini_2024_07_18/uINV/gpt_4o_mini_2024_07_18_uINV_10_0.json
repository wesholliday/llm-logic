The original statement only tells us what happens when the dog is inside, but it does not specify what happens when the dog is not inside. The cat could still be outside or could be inside regardless of the dog's location. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
