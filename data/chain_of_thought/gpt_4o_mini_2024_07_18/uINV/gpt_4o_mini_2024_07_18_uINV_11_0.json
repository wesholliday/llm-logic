            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the inverse of this statement, we consider \"If not P, then not Q,\" which translates to \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" However, this does not logically follow from the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens if the cake is chocolate; it does not provide information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate. \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not imply its inverse. There could be other scenarios where the muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
