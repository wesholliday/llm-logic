            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll is plastic\" and Q is \"the truck is metal.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\" (if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not metal). \n\nHowever, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but the inverse (which is what the question is asking) is not necessarily true. The inverse of the original statement would be \"If not P, then not Q,\" which does not follow from the original statement. \n\nIn simpler terms, just because the doll is not plastic does not mean that the truck cannot be metal; the truck could still be metal regardless of the material of the doll. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
