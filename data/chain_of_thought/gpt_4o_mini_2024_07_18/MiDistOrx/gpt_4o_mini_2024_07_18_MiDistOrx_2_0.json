            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the wibble: it could either be on the zizz or in the snizzle. The phrase \"or\" indicates that at least one of these conditions is true. The rephrased statement \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle\" maintains the same meaning, as it explicitly states the two possibilities separately. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
