            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the snork: either it is in the wibble or it is on the quank. The phrase \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of these possibilities is true. The rephrased statement \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank\" maintains the same meaning, as it explicitly separates the two possibilities while still conveying that at least one of them is true. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
