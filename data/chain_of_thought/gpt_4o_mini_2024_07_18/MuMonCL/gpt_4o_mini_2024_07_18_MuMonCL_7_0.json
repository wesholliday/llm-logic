            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" contains two parts: the difficulty of the exam and the coverage of all chapters. The phrase \"must have been difficult\" is part of the overall assertion. Since the statement explicitly states that the exam was difficult, we can indeed infer that the exam must have been difficult on its own, regardless of the second part about covering all chapters. Therefore, the inference that \"The exam must have been difficult\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
