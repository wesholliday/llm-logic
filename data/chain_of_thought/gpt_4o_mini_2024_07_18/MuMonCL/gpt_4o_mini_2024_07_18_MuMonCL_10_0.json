            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" indicates that both actions\u2014signing and notarizing\u2014are required for the document to be considered valid. If we focus on the phrase \"must have been signed,\" it is indeed a part of the original statement. Therefore, if the document is required to be both signed and notarized, we can infer that it must have been signed as a prerequisite for notarization. Thus, the inference that \"The document must have been signed\" is valid based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
