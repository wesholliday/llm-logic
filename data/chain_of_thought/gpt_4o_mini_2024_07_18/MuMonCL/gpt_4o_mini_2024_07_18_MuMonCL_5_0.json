If we focus on the first part of the statement, \"The package must have been delivered today,\" we can see that this condition is indeed included in the original statement. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, we can infer that the package was delivered today, regardless of whether it was signed for or not. \n\nAnswer: yes",
