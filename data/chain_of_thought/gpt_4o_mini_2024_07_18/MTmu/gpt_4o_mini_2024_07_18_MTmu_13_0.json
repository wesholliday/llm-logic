            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue,\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, we can conclude \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we have established that the truck was not blue (not Q), we can infer that the car was not red (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
