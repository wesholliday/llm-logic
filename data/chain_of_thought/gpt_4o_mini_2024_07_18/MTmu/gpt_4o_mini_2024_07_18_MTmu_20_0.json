            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana must have been yellow.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow,\" can be expressed as \"not B.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false (not B), we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule in logic. Therefore, since we have \"not B,\" we can infer \"not A,\" which translates to \"the apple was not red.\"\n\nThus, we can conclude that from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
