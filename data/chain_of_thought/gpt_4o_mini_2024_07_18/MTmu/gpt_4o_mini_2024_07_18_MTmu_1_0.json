The first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then Sue must also be at the wedding (S is true). However, the second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding (Not S is true).\n\nIn logical terms, if we have M \u2192 S and we know Not S is true, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of M \u2192 S is Not S \u2192 Not M, which means if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary cannot be at the wedding either.\n\nSince we have established that Not S is true, we can conclude that Not M must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
