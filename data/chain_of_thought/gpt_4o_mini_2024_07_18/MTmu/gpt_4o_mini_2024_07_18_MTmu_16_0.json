            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P (the shirt is cotton), then Q (the pants are denim).\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim,\" can be expressed as \"Not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the conclusion (Q) is false (Not Q), we can infer that the premise (P) must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we have established that the pants are not denim (Not Q), we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
