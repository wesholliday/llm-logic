            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train,\" negates Q, which can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can conclude \"not P\" must also be true. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we have established that Erin did not take a train (not Q), we can infer that Sam did not take a plane (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
