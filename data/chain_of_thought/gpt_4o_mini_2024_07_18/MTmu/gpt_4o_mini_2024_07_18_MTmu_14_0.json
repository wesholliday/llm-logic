            "content": "Explanation: The first statement can be interpreted as a conditional statement: \"If A (the bear was in the cave), then B (the wolf must have been in the den).\" The second statement negates the conclusion of the first statement: \"It's not the case that B (the wolf must have been in the den).\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n\n1. A \u2192 B (If A, then B)\n2. \u00acB (Not B)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can apply the contrapositive rule of logic, which states that if A implies B, then not B implies not A. Therefore, since we have \u00acB, we can conclude \u00acA, which means \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
