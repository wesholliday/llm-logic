            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" negates Q, which can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, we can apply the principle of modus tollens. This principle states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false (not Q), then P must also be false (not P). \n\nThus, from the two statements provided, we can conclude that since Lucy did not go to the zoo, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
