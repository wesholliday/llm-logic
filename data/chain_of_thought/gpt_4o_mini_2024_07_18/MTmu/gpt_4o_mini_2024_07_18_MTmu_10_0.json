The contrapositive of D \u2192 C is \u00acC \u2192 \u00acD (If the cat is not outside, then the dog is not inside). \n\nSince we have \u00acC (the cat is not outside), we can conclude \u00acD (the dog is not inside) using the contrapositive.\n\nThus, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
