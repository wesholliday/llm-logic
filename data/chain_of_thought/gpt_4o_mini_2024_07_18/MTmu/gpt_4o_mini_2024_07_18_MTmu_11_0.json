            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins must have been blueberry.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry,\" translates to \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since we have \"not Q,\" we can infer \"not P,\" which means \"the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
