            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball,\" negates Q, which can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, we can apply the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Since we have \"not Q\" (Jen did not watch basketball), we can conclude \"not P,\" which means \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
