            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy must have played tennis.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis,\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. \n\nTherefore, since we have \"not Q\" (Amy did not play tennis), we can infer \"not P\" (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nAnswer: yes",
