            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be interpreted as \"Not Q.\" \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule in logic. Therefore, since we have established that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not Q), we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P).\n\nThus, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
