            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can break them down logically. The first statement, \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked,\" can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- Let P represent \"the splat was morphed.\"\n- Let Q represent \"the splat must have quanked.\"\n\nThis gives us the implication: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q).\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked,\" translates to \u00acQ (not Q).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP (not P). \n\nIn this case, since we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP, which means \"the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nThus, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
