            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements: \n\n1. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as: \n   - If P (the dreb was vroombed), then Q (the dreb must have been spened).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\" This can be expressed as:\n   - Not Q (the dreb must have been spened is false).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical principle known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened).\n- We also have Not Q (the dreb must have been spened is false).\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\n- Since Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false, which means that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
