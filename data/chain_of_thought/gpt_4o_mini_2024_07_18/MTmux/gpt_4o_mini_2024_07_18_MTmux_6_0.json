            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can break them down logically. The first statement, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink,\" can be represented as: \n\n- Let P = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n- Let Q = \"the grommet must have plopped the frink\"\n\nThis gives us the implication: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true).\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink,\" can be represented as \u00acQ (Q is false).\n\nNow, we have:\n1. P \u2192 Q\n2. \u00acQ\n\nFrom these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if P implies Q (P \u2192 Q) and Q is false (\u00acQ), then P must also be false (\u00acP). \n\nThus, since we have \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP, which means \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the grommet was not sploffed based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
