            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can break them down using logical reasoning. The first statement, \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled,\" can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- Let P represent \"the sprocket was cranked.\"\n- Let Q represent \"the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n\nThis gives us the implication: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q).\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled,\" can be expressed as \u00acQ (not Q).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP (not P). In this case, since we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP, which means \"the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nThus, we can indeed infer that the sprocket was not cranked based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
