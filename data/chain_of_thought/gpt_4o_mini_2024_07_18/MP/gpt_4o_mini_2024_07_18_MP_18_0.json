            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" The second statement confirms that P is true (\"The doll was plastic\"). According to the rules of logic, specifically Modus Ponens, if the first statement (the conditional) is true and the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the result) must also be true. Therefore, since both statements are true, we can conclude that \"The truck was metal\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
