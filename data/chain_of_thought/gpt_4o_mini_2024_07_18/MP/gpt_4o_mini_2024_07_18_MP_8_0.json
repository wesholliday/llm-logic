            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" The second statement, \"The vampire was awake,\" confirms that P is true. In logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since both statements are true, we can conclude that \"The mummy was awake\" (Q) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
