            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement confirms that P is true: \"Tom watched football.\" According to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since Tom did watch football, we can conclude that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
