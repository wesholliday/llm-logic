            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that Joe's action of going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy's action of going to the zoo. The second statement confirms that Joe did indeed go to the park. Since the condition for Lucy going to the zoo has been met (Joe went to the park), we can logically conclude that Lucy must have gone to the zoo as a result. Therefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
