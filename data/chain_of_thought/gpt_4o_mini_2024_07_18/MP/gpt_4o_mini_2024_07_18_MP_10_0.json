            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\" The second statement, \"The dog was inside,\" confirms that P is true. According to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since we have established that the dog was indeed inside, we can conclude that the cat must be outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
