            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement, \"The car was red,\" confirms the condition P. In logic, if the condition (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since we have established that the car was indeed red, we can conclude that the truck must be blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
