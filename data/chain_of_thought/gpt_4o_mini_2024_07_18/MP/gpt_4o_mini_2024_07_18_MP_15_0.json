            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The second statement confirms that P is true (\"Sam took a plane\"). According to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since we know that Sam took a plane, we can conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
