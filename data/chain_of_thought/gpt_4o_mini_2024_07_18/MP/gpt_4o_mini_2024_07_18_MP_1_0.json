            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. It indicates that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. The second statement, \"Mary was at the wedding,\" confirms that the condition of the first statement is met. Since the condition is satisfied, we can conclude that the outcome must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\" based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
