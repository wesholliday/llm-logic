            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement confirms that P is true: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" According to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since both statements are true, we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
