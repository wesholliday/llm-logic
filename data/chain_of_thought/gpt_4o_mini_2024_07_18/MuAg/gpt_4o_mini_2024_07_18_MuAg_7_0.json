            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The exam must have been difficult and it must have covered all chapters\" contains two separate clauses connected by \"and.\" The phrase \"must have been difficult\" and \"must have covered all chapters\" are both necessary conditions for the conclusion. When we say \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters,\" we are essentially combining these two clauses into one statement. The meaning remains the same; both conditions are still present. Therefore, we can infer that the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
