            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and it must have been under budget\" contains two separate conditions connected by the word \"and.\" The phrase \"it must have been under budget\" is a separate clause that can be rephrased without changing its meaning. Therefore, we can combine the two clauses into a single statement: \"The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget.\" The meaning remains the same, as both conditions are still required. \n\nAnswer: yes",
