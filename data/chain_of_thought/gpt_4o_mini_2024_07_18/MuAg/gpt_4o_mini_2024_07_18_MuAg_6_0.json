            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out and it must have started at 8 PM\" contains two separate clauses connected by \"and.\" The first clause asserts that the concert was sold out, and the second clause asserts that it started at 8 PM. The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a strong assumption or inference about the state of the concert. \n\nWhen we rephrase this as \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM,\" we are essentially combining the two clauses into one statement. The meaning remains the same; both conditions (being sold out and starting at 8 PM) are still being asserted. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
