            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for\" contains two separate clauses connected by \"and.\" The phrase \"it must have been signed for\" is a separate assertion that is dependent on the delivery of the package. When we rephrase this to \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" we are essentially combining the two clauses into one. The meaning remains the same, as both statements assert that the package was delivered today and that it was signed for. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
