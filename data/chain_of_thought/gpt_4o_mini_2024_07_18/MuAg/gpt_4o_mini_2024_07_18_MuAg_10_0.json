            "content": "Explanation: The original statement specifies that the document must have been both signed and notarized, using the phrase \"must have been signed and it must have been notarized.\" This indicates that both actions are required for the document to be valid. The phrase \"signed and notarized\" is a more concise way of expressing the same requirement. Therefore, we can infer that if the document must have been signed and it must have been notarized, it logically follows that the document must have been signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
