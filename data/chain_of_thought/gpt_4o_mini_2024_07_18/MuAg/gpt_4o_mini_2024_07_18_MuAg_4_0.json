            "content": "Explanation: The original statement specifies two conditions: the meeting must occur at 2 PM and it must take place in the conference room. The phrase \"and it must be in the conference room\" indicates that both conditions are required simultaneously. The rephrased statement \"The meeting must be at 2 PM and in the conference room\" maintains the same meaning, as it combines both conditions into a single statement without altering their requirements. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
