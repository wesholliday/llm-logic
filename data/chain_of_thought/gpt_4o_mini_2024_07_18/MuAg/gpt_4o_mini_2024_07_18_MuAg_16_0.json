            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily and it must have had fresh towels\" indicates that both conditions are necessary: the room was cleaned daily and it had fresh towels. The phrase \"must have had\" implies a certainty about the presence of fresh towels. When we rephrase this to \"The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels,\" we are essentially combining the two conditions into a single statement. The meaning remains the same, as both conditions are still being asserted. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
