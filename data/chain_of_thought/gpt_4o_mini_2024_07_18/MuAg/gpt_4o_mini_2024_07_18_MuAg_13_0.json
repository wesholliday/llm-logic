            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The movie must have been in English and it must have had subtitles\" contains two separate conditions: that the movie was in English and that it had subtitles. The phrase \"must have been in English and it must have had subtitles\" can be rephrased as \"must have been in English and had subtitles\" without changing the meaning. The conjunction \"and\" connects both conditions, and the use of \"must have\" applies to both parts. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
