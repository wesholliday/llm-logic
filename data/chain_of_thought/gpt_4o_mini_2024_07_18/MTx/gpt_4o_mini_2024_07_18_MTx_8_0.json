            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" The second statement \"The sprocket was not daggled\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q,\" we can conclude \"not P.\" This is known as the contrapositive reasoning. Therefore, since we know the sprocket was not daggled (not Q), we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
