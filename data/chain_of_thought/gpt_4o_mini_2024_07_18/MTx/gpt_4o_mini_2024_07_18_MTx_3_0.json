            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can use logical reasoning. The first statement, \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"Morphed \u2192 Quanked.\" The second statement, \"The splat did not quank,\" can be expressed as \"\u00acQuanked.\" \n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement, we can derive that if the splat did not quank (\u00acQuanked), then it was not morphed (\u00acMorphed). This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThus, from \"Morphed \u2192 Quanked\" and \"\u00acQuanked,\" we can conclude \"\u00acMorphed.\" Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
