            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \n\n1. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (the dreb was vroombed), then Q (the dreb was spened). \n\n2. \"The dreb was not spened.\" This can be expressed as \u00acQ (not Q).\n\nFrom the first statement, we can apply the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if P implies Q, then not Q implies not P. In this case, if we know that Q is false (the dreb was not spened), we can conclude that P must also be false (the dreb was not vroombed). \n\nThus, since we have \u00acQ (the dreb was not spened), we can infer \u00acP (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
