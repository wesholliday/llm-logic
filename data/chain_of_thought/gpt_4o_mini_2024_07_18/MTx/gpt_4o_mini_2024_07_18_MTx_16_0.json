            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, we can break them down using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This can be represented as: \n\n- Let P = \"The sneg was crampled\"\n- Let Q = \"The sneg sproted the frink\"\n\nThe first statement can be expressed as: \n- If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n\nThe second statement is: \"The sneg did not sproted the frink,\" which can be represented as:\n- Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nNow, we can apply the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which can be expressed as:\n- If \u00acQ, then \u00acP (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP)\n\nSince we have \u00acQ (the sneg did not sproted the frink), we can conclude \u00acP (the sneg was not crampled) based on the contrapositive. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
