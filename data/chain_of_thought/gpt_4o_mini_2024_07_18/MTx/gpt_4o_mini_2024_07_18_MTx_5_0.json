            "content": "Explanation: We start with the first statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (the zinger is fraggled), then Q (the zinger is smoogled). The second statement is \"The zinger was not smoogled,\" which can be expressed as \u00acQ (not Q). \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), we can use the contrapositive to infer that P must also be false (\u00acP). The contrapositive of the original statement is: If the zinger was not smoogled (\u00acQ), then the zinger was not fraggled (\u00acP). \n\nSince we have \u00acQ (the zinger was not smoogled), we can conclude \u00acP (the zinger was not fraggled). Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
