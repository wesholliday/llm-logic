            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in logical terms as: if P (the fribble was snurgled), then Q (the fribble crinked). The second statement, \"The fribble did not crink,\" indicates that Q is false. In logical reasoning, if Q is false and we have a conditional statement where P implies Q, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since the fribble did not crink, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
