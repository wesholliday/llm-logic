            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\" The second statement, \"The wug was not garpled,\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we know \"The wug was not garpled\" (not Q), we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged\" (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
