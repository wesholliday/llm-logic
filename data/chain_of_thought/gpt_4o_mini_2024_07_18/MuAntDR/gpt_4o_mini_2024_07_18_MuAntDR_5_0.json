            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" presents two possibilities: either the package was delivered yesterday or it was delivered the day before. However, it does not definitively confirm that it was delivered on one specific day. Therefore, while it is possible that the package was delivered the day before, it is also possible that it was delivered yesterday. Since we cannot conclude with certainty that it was delivered the day before based solely on the information given, we cannot infer that it must have been delivered on that specific day.\n\nAnswer: no",
