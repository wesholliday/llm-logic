            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the flob was skizzled. This suggests that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled. The phrase \"might not have been skizzled\" indicates a potential scenario where the flob was not skizzled, which aligns with the negation of the necessity implied in the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that if it is not the case that the flob must have been skizzled, then it is indeed possible that the flob might not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
