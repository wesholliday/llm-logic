            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" suggests that it is not necessary for the smonk to have been vreebled. This implies that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled. The phrase \"might not have been\" indicates a possibility, which aligns with the negation of the necessity expressed in the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that if it is not necessary for the smonk to have been vreebled, then it is indeed possible that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
