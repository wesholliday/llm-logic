            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" implies that it is not necessary for the splat to have undergone morphing. This suggests that there is a possibility that the splat has not been morphed at all. The phrase \"might not have been morphed\" indicates a possibility, which aligns with the negation of the necessity implied in the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that if it is not necessary for the splat to have been morphed, then it is indeed possible that it has not been morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
