However, it does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam. The difficulty of an exam is not inherently linked to the number of chapters it covers; an exam could cover all chapters and still be easy, or it could be difficult regardless of the number of chapters. Therefore, we cannot infer that the exam might be difficult based solely on the information given about it covering all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
