            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wump might be quank and the snorkel might be snizzle\" suggests a possibility regarding the states of the wump and the snorkel. The use of \"might\" indicates that there is uncertainty or potentiality involved. When we say \"It might be that the wump is quank and the snorkel is snizzle,\" we are essentially restating the same idea in a different form. The inference maintains the same level of uncertainty and possibility as the original statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
