            "content": "Explanation: The original statement uses the phrase \"might be,\" which indicates a possibility rather than certainty. The phrase \"It might be that\" serves a similar purpose, suggesting that the situation described is also a possibility. Both statements convey the same idea: that the flimble could be at a certain location and the gribble could be in another location. Therefore, we can infer that the second statement is a rephrasing of the first, maintaining the same meaning regarding possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
