            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zump might be quorple and the snizzle might wibble froodle zibber\" suggests a possibility regarding the states of the zump and the snizzle. The use of \"might\" indicates that these are not definitive statements but rather potential scenarios. The inference \"It might be that the zump is quorple and the snizzle wibbles froodle zibber\" maintains the same structure of possibility. It does not change the meaning but rather rephrases it. Therefore, we can conclude that the inference is valid based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
