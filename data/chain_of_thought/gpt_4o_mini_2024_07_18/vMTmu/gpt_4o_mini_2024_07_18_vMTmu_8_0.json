            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\n1. The first premise can be expressed as: \n   - If P (the vampire was awake), then Q (the mummy must have been awake). \n   - Symbolically, this is represented as: P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The second premise states: \n   - It is not the case that Q (the mummy must have been awake). \n   - Symbolically, this is represented as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion we want to reach is: \n   - The vampire was not awake, which can be expressed as: \u00acP.\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n- From P \u2192 Q (if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake) and \u00acQ (the mummy was not awake), we can validly conclude \u00acP (the vampire was not awake).\n\nSince the argument follows this valid logical structure, we can conclude that the argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
