            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\n1. The first premise can be expressed as: \n   - P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q), where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \n   - \u00acQ (It is not the case that Q, meaning \"the truck must have been metal\" is false).\n\n3. The conclusion we want to reach is: \n   - \u00acP (The doll was not plastic).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n- From P \u2192 Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal) and \u00acQ (the truck must not have been metal), we can validly conclude \u00acP (the doll was not plastic).\n\nSince the argument follows this valid logical structure, we can conclude that the argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
