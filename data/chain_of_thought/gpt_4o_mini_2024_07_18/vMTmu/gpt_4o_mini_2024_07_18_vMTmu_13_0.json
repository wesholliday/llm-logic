            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\n1. The first premise can be expressed as: \n   - P \u2192 Q (If the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q)).\n   \n2. The second premise states: \n   - \u00acQ (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue).\n   \n3. The conclusion we want to evaluate is: \n   - \u00acP (The car was not red).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n- From P \u2192 Q (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue) and \u00acQ (The truck was not blue), we can validly conclude \u00acP (The car was not red).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
