            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\").\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acQ (not Q).\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Tom did not watch football.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acP (not P).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (\u00acQ), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball).\n- We also have \u00acQ (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nBy applying Modus Tollens:\n- Since Q is false (\u00acQ), we can conclude that P must also be false (\u00acP), which means \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
