            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\nThe first premise states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy must have played tennis\").\n\nThe second premise states: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as:\n- \u00acQ (not Q).\n\nThe conclusion we want to reach is: \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which can be represented as:\n- \u00acP (not P).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n1. We have P \u2192 Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis).\n2. We have \u00acQ (It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can validly conclude \u00acP (Jeff did not play basketball). \n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
