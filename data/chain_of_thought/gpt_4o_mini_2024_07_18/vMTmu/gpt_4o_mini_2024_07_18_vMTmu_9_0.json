            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acQ (not Q).\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which can be represented as:\n   - \u00acP (not P).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n- From P \u2192 Q (if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt) and \u00acQ (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), we can validly conclude \u00acP (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
