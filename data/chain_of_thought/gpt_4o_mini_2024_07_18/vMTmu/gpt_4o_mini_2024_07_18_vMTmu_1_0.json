            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding).\n   - Symbolically: M \u2192 S.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as:\n   - Not S (Sue was not at the wedding).\n   - Symbolically: \u00acS.\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as:\n   - Not M (Mary was not at the wedding).\n   - Symbolically: \u00acM.\n\nNow, we can analyze the logical structure:\n- From the first premise (M \u2192 S), if we know that \u00acS (Sue was not at the wedding) is true, we can apply the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive states that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. This can be expressed as:\n   - \u00acS \u2192 \u00acM.\n\nSince we have \u00acS as true, we can conclude \u00acM must also be true. Therefore, the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
