            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\n1. The first premise can be expressed as: \n   - If P (the shirt was cotton), then Q (the pants must have been denim). \n   - Symbolically, this is represented as: P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The second premise states: \n   - It is not the case that Q (the pants must have been denim). \n   - Symbolically, this is represented as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion we want to reach is: \n   - The shirt was not cotton, which can be expressed as: \u00acP.\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n- From P \u2192 Q (if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim) and \u00acQ (the pants were not denim), we can validly conclude \u00acP (the shirt was not cotton).\n\nSince the argument follows this valid logical structure, we can conclude that the argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
