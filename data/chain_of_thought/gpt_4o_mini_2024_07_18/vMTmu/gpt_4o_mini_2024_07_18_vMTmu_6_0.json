            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - P \u2192 Q (where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\").\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acQ (not Q).\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acP (not P).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta).\n- We also have \u00acQ (It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta).\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\n- From P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
