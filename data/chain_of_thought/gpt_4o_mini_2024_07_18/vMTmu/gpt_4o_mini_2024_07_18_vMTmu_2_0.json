            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - G \u2192 U (where G = \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U = \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\").\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acU (not U).\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acG (not G).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case:\n- We have G \u2192 U (the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn must be in the forest).\n- We also have \u00acU (the unicorn is not in the forest).\n\nUsing Modus Tollens:\n- From G \u2192 U and \u00acU, we can conclude \u00acG (the griffin is not in the forest).\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
