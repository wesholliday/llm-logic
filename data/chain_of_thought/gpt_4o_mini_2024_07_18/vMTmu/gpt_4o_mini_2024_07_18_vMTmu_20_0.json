            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\n1. The first premise can be expressed as: \n   - P \u2192 Q (If the apple was red (P), then the banana must have been yellow (Q)).\n   \n2. The second premise states: \n   - \u00acQ (It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow).\n   \n3. The conclusion we want to reach is: \n   - \u00acP (The apple was not red).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP. \n\nIn this case:\n- From P \u2192 Q (If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow) and \u00acQ (The banana was not yellow), we can validly conclude \u00acP (The apple was not red).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
