            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\nLet's denote:\n- P: \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n- Q: \"The wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\nThe first premise can be expressed as: \n1. If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q).\n\nThe second premise states:\n2. It is not the case that Q (\u00acQ).\n\nThe conclusion we want to reach is:\n3. \u00acP (The bear was not in the cave).\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, which states that if we have \"If P then Q\" and \"not Q,\" we can conclude \"not P.\" \n\nIn this case:\n- From the first premise (P \u2192 Q) and the second premise (\u00acQ), we can validly conclude \u00acP.\n\nSince the argument follows a valid logical structure, we can conclude that the argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
