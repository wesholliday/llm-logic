            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If P (Ben ate pasta), then Q (Kate ate salad). \n   - Symbolically, this is P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (Kate did not eat salad).\n   - Symbolically, this is \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion states: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be represented as:\n   - Not P (Ben did not eat pasta).\n   - Symbolically, this is \u00acP.\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). \n\nIn this case:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad).\n- We also have \u00acQ (Kate did not eat salad).\n\nBy applying Modus Tollens:\n- From P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
