            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided. \n\n1. The first statement is 'The vampire was awake.' This is a straightforward assertion that the vampire is indeed awake.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.' This means that the state of the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that 'The vampire was awake' is true, we can apply the second statement. The condition of the vampire being awake is satisfied, which means we can conclude that the condition leads to the conclusion that 'The mummy was awake' must also be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that 'The mummy was awake' based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
