The first statement is 'The alien visited Mars'. This is a straightforward assertion.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. This means that the truth of the first statement (the alien visiting Mars) guarantees the truth of the second statement (the robot visiting Jupiter).\n\nSince the first statement is true ('The alien visited Mars'), we can apply the conditional logic from the second statement. Because the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is satisfied, we can conclude that the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
