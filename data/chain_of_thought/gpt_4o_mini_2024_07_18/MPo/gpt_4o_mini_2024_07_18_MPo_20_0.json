The first statement is 'The apple was red.' This is a factual statement about the apple.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.' This means that the truth of the banana being yellow is dependent on the apple being red.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that 'The apple was red' is true, we can apply the second statement. The condition of the second statement (the apple being red) is satisfied, which means we can conclude that the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The banana was yellow' based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
