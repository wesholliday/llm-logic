            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement, 'Lisa bought the red shirt', is a factual statement. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (if P, then Q) asserts that if the first part (P) is true, then the second part (Q) must also be true. Since we know from the first statement that P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which allows us to conclude that Q (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since both statements are true and the first statement confirms the condition of the second statement, we can indeed infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
