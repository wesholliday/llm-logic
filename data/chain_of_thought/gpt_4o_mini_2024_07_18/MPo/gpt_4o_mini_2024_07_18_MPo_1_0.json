            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the statements provided, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement, 'Mary was at the wedding', is a factual assertion. The second statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. \n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be represented as: \n- P \u2192 Q, where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nSince we know that P is true (Mary was indeed at the wedding), we can apply modus ponens, which states that if P is true and P implies Q, then Q must also be true. Therefore, since Mary was at the wedding (P is true), we can conclude that Sue must also be at the wedding (Q is true).\n\nThus, we can infer that 'Sue was at the wedding' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
