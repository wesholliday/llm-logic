            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"The book is a mystery novel\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. \n\n1. The first statement, \"The book was written by James,\" is a factual assertion about the authorship of the book.\n2. The second statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" is a conditional statement (an implication). It suggests that the authorship by James guarantees that the book falls into the category of mystery novels.\n\nNow, since the first statement confirms that the book was indeed written by James, we can apply the second statement. The condition of the second statement (the book being written by James) is satisfied, which means we can conclude that the consequence of the implication must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
