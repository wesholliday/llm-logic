            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jen watched basketball' from the statements provided, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement, 'Tom watched football', is a straightforward assertion about Tom's actions. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (if P, then Q) means that if the first part (P) is true, then the second part (Q) must also be true. Since we know from the first statement that 'Tom watched football' is true, we can apply the conditional statement. Given that the condition (Tom watched football) is satisfied, we can conclude that the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
