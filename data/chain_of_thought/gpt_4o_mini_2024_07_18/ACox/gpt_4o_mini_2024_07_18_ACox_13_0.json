The second statement is a conditional statement that indicates that if the splat were morphed, it would necessarily follow that it was quanked. However, the fact that the splat was quanked does not provide any information about whether it was morphed or not. \n\nIn logical terms, the first statement confirms the consequent of the second statement but does not confirm the antecedent. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The splat was morphed\" based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
