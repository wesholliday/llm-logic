The second statement is a conditional statement that tells us that if the flugel were blimmed, it would necessarily follow that it is zargled. However, the fact that the flugel is zargled does not provide any information about whether it is blimmed or not. The conditional statement does not imply that the flugel must be blimmed; it only states what would happen if it were blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The flugel was blimmed\" based solely on the information provided. \n\nAnswer: no",
