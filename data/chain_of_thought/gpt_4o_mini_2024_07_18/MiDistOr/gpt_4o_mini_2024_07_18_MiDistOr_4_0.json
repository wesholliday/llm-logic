            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" presents two possibilities regarding the meeting: it could either start at 2 PM or it could be cancelled. The phrasing is somewhat ambiguous but implies that at least one of these outcomes is possible. The rephrased statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" maintains the same meaning and structure, explicitly stating the two possibilities. Both statements convey the same idea that there are two potential outcomes for the meeting. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is a valid interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
