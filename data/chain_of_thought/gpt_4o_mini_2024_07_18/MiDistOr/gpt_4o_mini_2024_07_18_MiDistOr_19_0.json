            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" presents two options for completing the application: online and in person. The phrase \"or\" indicates that either option is possible. When we rephrase it as \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person,\" we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate clauses, both of which are true based on the original statement. Therefore, the inference is valid because it maintains the meaning of the original statement while clarifying the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
