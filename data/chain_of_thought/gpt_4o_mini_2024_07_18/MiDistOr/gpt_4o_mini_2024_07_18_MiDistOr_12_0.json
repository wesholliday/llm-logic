            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities: either the project will be completed by Friday, or it will be extended. The phrasing suggests that both outcomes are possible, and it does not imply that one excludes the other. The rephrased statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or it might be extended\" maintains the same meaning and structure, clearly indicating that either outcome is a possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is a valid interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
