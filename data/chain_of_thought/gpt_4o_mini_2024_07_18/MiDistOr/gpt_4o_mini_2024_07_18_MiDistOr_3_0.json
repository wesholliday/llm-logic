            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the keys. It suggests that there are two potential places where the keys could be found: either in the drawer or on the table. The rephrased statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table\" maintains the same meaning, explicitly stating that each location is a separate possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
