            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" presents two possibilities regarding the restaurant's operation on Mondays. The phrase \"might be closed\" suggests that there is uncertainty about whether the restaurant is indeed closed, while \"open for limited hours\" indicates another uncertain possibility. \n\nThe rephrased statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours\" maintains the same meaning and structure as the original statement. Both versions express the same idea: there are two potential scenarios regarding the restaurant's status on Mondays, and either could be true. \n\nSince the rephrased statement accurately reflects the possibilities presented in the original statement, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
