            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope might be upstairs or under a bed\" presents two possibilities regarding the location of the envelope. The phrase \"might be\" indicates uncertainty about the envelope's location, and the use of \"or\" suggests that either of the two locations is a valid possibility. The rephrased statement \"The envelope might be upstairs or it might be under a bed\" maintains the same meaning and conveys the same uncertainty about the envelope's location. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
