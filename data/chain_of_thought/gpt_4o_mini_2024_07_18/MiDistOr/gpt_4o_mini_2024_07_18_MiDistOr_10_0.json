            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" suggests that there are two possibilities regarding the document: it could either be signed, or it could be notarized, or it could potentially be both. The phrase \"might be\" indicates uncertainty about whether either action will occur. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" because it breaks down the original statement into its individual components, maintaining the same meaning of uncertainty regarding each action.\n\nAnswer: yes",
