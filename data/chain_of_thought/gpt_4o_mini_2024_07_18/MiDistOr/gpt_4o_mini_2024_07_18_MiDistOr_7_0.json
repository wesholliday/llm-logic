            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The exam might be difficult or easy\" presents two possibilities regarding the nature of the exam: it could be difficult, or it could be easy. The phrase \"or easy\" implies that both options are being considered as potential outcomes. When we rephrase it to \"The exam might be difficult or it might be easy,\" we are explicitly stating the two possibilities, which does not change the meaning. Both statements convey the same idea that there are two potential states for the exam. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
