            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently,\" which can be expressed in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Ben studied\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Ben studied diligently.\" The conclusion states, \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,\" which can be expressed as \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. The premise suggests that if Ben studied, he did not study diligently. This implies that studying (P) and studying diligently (Q) cannot both be true at the same time. However, the conclusion states that if Ben studied diligently (Q), then he did not study (\u00acP). \n\nThis creates a contradiction because if Ben studied diligently (Q is true), it would imply that he did not study (P is false), which is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide a basis for concluding that studying diligently leads to not studying at all. Therefore, the argument does not hold logically.\n\nAnswer: no",
