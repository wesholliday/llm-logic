            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n- P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P is \"Ann exercised\" and Q is \"Ann exercised strenuously\").\n\nThe conclusion states, \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" This can be represented as:\n\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise suggests that if Ann exercised (P), then she did not exercise strenuously (\u00acQ). This implies that exercising (P) and exercising strenuously (Q) cannot both be true at the same time. \n\nHowever, the conclusion states that if Ann exercised strenuously (Q), then she did not exercise (\u00acP). This is a different implication and does not logically follow from the premise. In fact, the premise does not provide any information about what happens when Ann exercises strenuously; it only states what happens when she exercises. \n\nTo illustrate this with a truth table or logical reasoning, we can see that the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
