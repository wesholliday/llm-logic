            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The premise states: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- Let A = \"advice was offered\"\n- Let H = \"helpful advice was offered\"\n\nThe premise can be rewritten as: A \u2192 \u00acH (If A, then not H).\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\" This can be expressed as: H \u2192 \u00acA (If H, then not A).\n\nNow, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise tells us that if advice was offered, it cannot be helpful. This means that if we assume helpful advice was offered (H), then it contradicts the premise that if advice was offered (A), it was not helpful (\u00acH). \n\nThus, if H is true, A must be false (\u00acA) to avoid contradiction. This means that the conclusion H \u2192 \u00acA is indeed valid based on the premise A \u2192 \u00acH. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
