            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"Alex exercised\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Alex exercised much\").\n\nThe conclusion states, \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This can be represented as:\n\n2. \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo assess the validity, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. The premise suggests that exercising implies not exercising much. However, the conclusion suggests that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise at all. \n\nTo see if this is valid, we can consider the implications:\n- If Alex did exercise (P is true), then according to the premise, he did not exercise much (\u00acQ is true).\n- If Alex exercised much (Q is true), the conclusion states that he did not exercise (\u00acP is true), which contradicts the premise since exercising much implies that he did exercise.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise does not support the conclusion, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
