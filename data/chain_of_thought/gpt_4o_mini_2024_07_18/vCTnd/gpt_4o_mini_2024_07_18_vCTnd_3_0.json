            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n- Let P = \"I ate a meal\"\n- Let Q = \"I ate a large meal\"\n\nThe premise can be expressed as: \n- P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P, then not Q)\n\nThe conclusion states, \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal,\" which can be represented as:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP (If Q, then not P)\n\nTo check for validity, we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the conclusion we are trying to prove. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the argument is valid.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise through the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
