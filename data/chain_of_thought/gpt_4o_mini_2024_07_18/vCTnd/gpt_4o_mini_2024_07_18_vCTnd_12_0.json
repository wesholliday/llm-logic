            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\nP \u2192 \u00acQ \n\nwhere P is \"Jane studied\" and Q is \"Jane studied long.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" This can be expressed as:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP \n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use the contrapositive and the rules of implication. The contrapositive of the premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is \u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which simplifies to Q \u2192 \u00acP. \n\nSince the conclusion (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is the same as the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
