            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states: \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\nP \u2192 \u00acQ \n\nwhere P is \"the customer was served\" and Q is \"the customer was served promptly.\" \n\nThe conclusion states: \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\" This can be expressed as:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP \n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use the contrapositive and the rules of implication. The contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the conclusion we are trying to prove. \n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
