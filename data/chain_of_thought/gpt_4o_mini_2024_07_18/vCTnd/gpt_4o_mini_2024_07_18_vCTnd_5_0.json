            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\nP \u2192 \u00acQ \n\nwhere P is \"the room was cleaned\" and Q is \"the room was cleaned thoroughly.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\" This can be expressed as:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP \n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use the contrapositive and the rules of implication. The contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the conclusion we are trying to prove. \n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
