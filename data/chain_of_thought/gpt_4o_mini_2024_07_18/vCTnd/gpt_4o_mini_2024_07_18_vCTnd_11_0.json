            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented can be analyzed using the principles of logic, specifically the concept of contraposition. The premise states, \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"I went to the store\" and \\( Q \\) is \"I bought vegetables.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store,\" which can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
