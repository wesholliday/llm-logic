            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\nP \u2192 \u00acQ \n\nwhere P is \"instructions were given\" and Q is \"instructions were explained clearly.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given,\" which can be represented as:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, we can examine the relationship between these statements. The premise suggests that the occurrence of P (instructions being given) leads to \u00acQ (instructions not being explained clearly). The conclusion, however, asserts that if Q (instructions being explained clearly) is true, then P (instructions being given) must be false (\u00acP).\n\nTo check for validity, we can use the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\" is \"Q \u2192 \u00acP,\" which is exactly the conclusion we are trying to prove. Since the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, the argument is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
