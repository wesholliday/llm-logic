            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states: \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\nP \u2192 \u00acQ \n\nwhere P is \"directions were provided\" and Q is \"directions were explained clearly.\" \n\nThe conclusion states: \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" This can be represented as:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, we can see that the premise and conclusion are in a form that can be analyzed using the rules of logic. The premise suggests that if P is true, then Q must be false. The conclusion suggests that if Q is true, then P must be false. \n\nThis is a classic case of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is (Q \u2192 \u00acP), which is exactly what the conclusion states. \n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
