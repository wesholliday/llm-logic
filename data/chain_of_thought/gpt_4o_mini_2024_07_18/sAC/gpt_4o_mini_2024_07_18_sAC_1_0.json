            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). This means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, the truth of Q (Sue was at the wedding) does not provide any information about the truth of P (Mary was at the wedding). In logical terms, the truth of Q does not imply the truth of P. Therefore, even though we know that Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary was also at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
