In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\" The truth of a conditional statement only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not provide information about the truth of P when Q is true. \n\nIn this case, we know that Q (\"Chris finished the race\") is true. However, we cannot conclude that P (\"Alex finished the race\") is true based solely on the information given. It is possible for Chris to finish the race without Alex finishing it. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Alex finished the race based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
