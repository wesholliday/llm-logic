            "content": "Explanation: We start with the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) is \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) is \"the mummy was awake.\" The truth of this statement means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true.\n\nWe are also given that \"The mummy was awake\" is true, which means \\( M \\) is true. However, the truth of \\( M \\) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( V \\). In logical terms, the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) does not imply that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( V \\) must also be true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example: If it is true that \"If it rains, then the ground is wet,\" and we know that \"the ground is wet,\" we cannot conclude that \"it is raining,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (like someone watering the garden).\n\nTherefore, since we cannot conclude that \"the vampire was awake\" based solely on the information provided, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no",
