The new statement \"The floob must be zibble by glorp or wozzle flimble\" introduces an additional option (wozzle flimble) while retaining the original condition. In logical terms, if the first statement is true, then the second statement can also be true because it includes the original condition as one of its possibilities. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the second statement is true based solely on the truth of the first statement, as the additional option (wozzle flimble) may or may not be true. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
