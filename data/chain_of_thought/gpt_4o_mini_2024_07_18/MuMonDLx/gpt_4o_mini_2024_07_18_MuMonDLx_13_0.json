            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The quorple must be in quazzle\" asserts a specific condition regarding the quorple's location. The new statement \"The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble\" introduces an additional option (zizz zump wobble) but does not negate the original condition. Since the original statement is true, adding an \"or\" clause does not change the truth of the original statement. Therefore, if the quorple is indeed in quazzle, the new statement is also true because it includes the possibility of being in quazzle. \n\nAnswer: yes",
