The second statement can be expressed as \"If Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" Therefore, since the original statement is \"If P, then not Q,\" we can indeed infer that \"If Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
