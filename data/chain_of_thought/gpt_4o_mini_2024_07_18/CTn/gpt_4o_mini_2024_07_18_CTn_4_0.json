The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of A \u2192 \u00acB is B \u2192 \u00acA. \n\nSince the contrapositive is valid, we can indeed infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nAnswer: yes",
