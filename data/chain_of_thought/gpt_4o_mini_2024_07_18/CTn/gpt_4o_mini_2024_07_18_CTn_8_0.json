            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" can be expressed in logical terms as \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire is awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy is awake.\" This means that if the vampire is awake, it necessarily follows that the mummy is not awake.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" we can express this as \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\). This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original implication. The contrapositive states that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nSince the contrapositive is a valid logical inference from the original statement, we can conclude that the statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
