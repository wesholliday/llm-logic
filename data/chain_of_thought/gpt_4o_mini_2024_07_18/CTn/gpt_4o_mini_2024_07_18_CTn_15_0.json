            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
