            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" we need to analyze the logical structure. The second statement can be expressed as \"If Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" Therefore, since the original statement is \"If P, then not Q,\" we can indeed infer that \"If Q, then not P\" is true.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
