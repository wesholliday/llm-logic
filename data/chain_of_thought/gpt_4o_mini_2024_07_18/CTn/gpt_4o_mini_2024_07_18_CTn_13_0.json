            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo analyze the inference \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red,\" we can express it as \"If Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince the original statement is true, we can conclude that the contrapositive is also true. Thus, we can infer that \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
