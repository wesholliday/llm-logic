This is a conditional statement. To determine if we can infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" (which can be expressed as \"If S, then not M\" or S \u2192 \u00acM), we need to analyze the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if Mary is present, Sue cannot be present. However, it does not provide a direct relationship that allows us to conclude the opposite: that if Sue is present, Mary must be absent. This is a common logical fallacy known as the fallacy of the converse. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
