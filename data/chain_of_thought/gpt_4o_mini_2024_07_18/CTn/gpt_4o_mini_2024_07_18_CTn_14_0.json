            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the bear was in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be rewritten as \"If A, then not B.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not B, then not A,\" which translates to \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" Since a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
