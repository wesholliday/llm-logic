            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then not B\" (where A is \"the apple is red\" and B is \"the banana is yellow\"). This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If B, then not A,\" which translates to \"If the banana is yellow, then the apple is not red.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
