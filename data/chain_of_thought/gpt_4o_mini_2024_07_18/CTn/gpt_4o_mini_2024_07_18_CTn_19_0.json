            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football,\" we can express this as \"If Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince the original statement is true, we can indeed infer that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
