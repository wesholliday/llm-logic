            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n- Let P be \"the book was written by James.\"\n- Let Q be \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe original statement can be expressed as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P, then not Q).\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James,\" we can express this as: \n\n- \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If not Q, then not P).\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince we can derive the contrapositive from the original statement, we can indeed infer that \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
