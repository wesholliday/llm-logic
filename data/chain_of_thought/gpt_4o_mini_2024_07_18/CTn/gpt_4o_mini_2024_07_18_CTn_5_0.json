            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball,\" we can express this as \"If Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince we have established that the original statement is true, we can conclude that the contrapositive is also true. Thus, we can infer that \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
