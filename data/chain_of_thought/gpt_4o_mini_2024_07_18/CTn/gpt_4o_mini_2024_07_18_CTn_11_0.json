            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate,\" we can express this as \"If Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince the original statement is true, we can indeed infer that \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
