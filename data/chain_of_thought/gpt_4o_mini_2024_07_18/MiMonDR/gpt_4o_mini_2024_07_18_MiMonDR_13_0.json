However, it does not provide any information about whether the meeting is currently scheduled or not. The phrase \"might be scheduled or cancelled\" introduces the possibility that the meeting could still be on the agenda, which is not implied by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the meeting might be scheduled based solely on the information that it might be cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no",
