            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" indicates uncertainty about the condition of the computer, specifically suggesting that it could be in a broken state. However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the computer being in a working state. The phrase \"might be working or broken\" introduces an additional possibility (that the computer could be working), which is not implied by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the computer might be working based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
