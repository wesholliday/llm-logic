The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n\n1. P: The twonk was plinked.\n2. Q: It was varnished.\n3. The conditional statement can be expressed as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q).\n\nSince we know that P is true (the twonk was plinked), we can apply modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens states that if we have a true conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nThus, since P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true, which means \"It was varnished\" is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
