            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was daggled\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. \n\n1. The first statement is \"The sprocket was cranked.\" This is a straightforward assertion that the action of cranking the sprocket took place.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This means that cranking the sprocket leads to the conclusion that the sprocket is daggled.\n\nNow, since the first statement confirms that \"The sprocket was cranked,\" we can apply the second statement. Because the condition of the second statement (the sprocket being cranked) is satisfied, we can conclude that the result of that condition must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
