The first statement is 'The fleeg was bluttered'. This is a simple assertion about the state of the fleeg.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'. This means that the condition of the fleeg being bluttered leads to the conclusion that it surned.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that 'The fleeg was bluttered' is true, we can apply the second statement. The condition of the second statement (the fleeg being bluttered) is satisfied, which allows us to conclude that the result (the fleeg surned) must also be true.\n\nThus, we can indeed infer 'The fleeg surned' based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
