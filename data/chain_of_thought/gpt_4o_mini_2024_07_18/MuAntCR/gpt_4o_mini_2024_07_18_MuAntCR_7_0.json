However, it does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam. The difficulty of an exam is not inherently linked to whether it covers all chapters; an exam can cover all chapters and still be easy, or it can be difficult regardless of the chapters covered. Therefore, we cannot infer that the exam was difficult based solely on the information that it covered all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
