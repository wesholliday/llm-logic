The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a strong assumption or conclusion based on available information, but it does not imply any specific time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the meeting was at 2 PM based solely on the information given about the location. The time of the meeting is not mentioned or implied in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
