            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The document must have been notarized\" indicates that the notarization process has taken place, which typically involves a notary public witnessing the signing of the document. However, the statement does not explicitly confirm that the document was signed; it only implies that notarization occurred. In most cases, notarization requires a signature, but the original statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the document was signed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been signed in addition to being notarized.\n\nAnswer: no",
