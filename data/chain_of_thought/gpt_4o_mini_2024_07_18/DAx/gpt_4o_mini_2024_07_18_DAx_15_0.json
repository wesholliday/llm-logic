            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" The second statement, \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" negates P. In logical reasoning, if P is false, we cannot directly conclude anything about Q. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was not spened\" because Q could still be true even if P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
