            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" The second statement \"The sprocket was not cranked\" can be represented as \"not P.\" \n\nIn logic, the implication \"If P, then Q\" does not allow us to conclude \"not Q\" from \"not P.\" This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the sprocket was not cranked (not P), it does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not daggled (not Q). The sprocket could still be daggled for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
