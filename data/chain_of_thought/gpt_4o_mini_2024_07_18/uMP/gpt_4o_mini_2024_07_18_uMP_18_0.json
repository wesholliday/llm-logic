            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" establishes a conditional relationship between the two objects. This means that whenever the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true. Since we are given that \"the doll was plastic,\" we can apply the conditional statement. Because the condition is satisfied (the doll is indeed plastic), we can conclude that the truck must be metal as per the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
