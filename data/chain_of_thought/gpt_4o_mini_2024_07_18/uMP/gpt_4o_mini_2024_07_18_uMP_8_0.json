The second statement confirms that \"the vampire was awake\", which can be represented as \"V\". \n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement (V \u2192 M) and we know that the antecedent (V) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (M) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens. Since both conditions are satisfied, we can infer that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
