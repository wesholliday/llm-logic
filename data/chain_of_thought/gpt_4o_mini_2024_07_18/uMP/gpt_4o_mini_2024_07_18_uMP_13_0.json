            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement confirms that P is true (\"the car was red\"). According to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since we know that the car was indeed red, we can conclude that the truck must be blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
