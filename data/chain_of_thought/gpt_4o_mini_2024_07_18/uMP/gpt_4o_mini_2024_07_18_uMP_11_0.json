This means that whenever the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. Since we are given that the cake was indeed chocolate, we can apply the conditional statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the muffins must be blueberry as a result of the cake being chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
