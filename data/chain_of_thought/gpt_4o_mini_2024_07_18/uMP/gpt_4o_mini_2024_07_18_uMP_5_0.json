            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The second statement confirms that P is true (\"Jeff played basketball\"). According to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since Jeff did play basketball, we can conclude that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
