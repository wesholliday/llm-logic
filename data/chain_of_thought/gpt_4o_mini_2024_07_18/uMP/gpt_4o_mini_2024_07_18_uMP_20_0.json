            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement confirms that P is true (\"the apple was red\"). In logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since both statements are true, we can conclude that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
