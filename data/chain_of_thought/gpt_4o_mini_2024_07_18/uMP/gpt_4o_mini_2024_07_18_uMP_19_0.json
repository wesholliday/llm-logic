            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" establishes a conditional relationship between Tom's action and Jen's action. This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement confirms that P is true, as it states \"Tom watched football.\" According to the rules of logic, specifically Modus Ponens, if the first statement (the conditional) is true and the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must also be true. Therefore, since both conditions are satisfied, we can conclude that Jen indeed watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
