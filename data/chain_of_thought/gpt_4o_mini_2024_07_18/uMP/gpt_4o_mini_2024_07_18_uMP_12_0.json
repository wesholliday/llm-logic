            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" establishes a conditional relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action. This means that Joe's going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy to go to the zoo. Since it is also given that Joe did indeed go to the park, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \"P implies Q\" (if P, then Q) is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, since Joe went to the park (P is true), we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
