            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" establishes a conditional relationship between the two creatures. This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest. The second statement confirms that the griffin was indeed in the forest. Since both conditions of the conditional statement are satisfied (the griffin is in the forest), we can logically conclude that the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
