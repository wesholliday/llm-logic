This means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true. Since it is given that Sam did indeed take a plane, we can apply the conditional statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Erin must have taken a train based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
