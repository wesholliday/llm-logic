            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" establishes a conditional relationship. This means that the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa is a sufficient condition for Mark to have bought the blue shirt. Since it is also given that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \"P implies Q\" (if P then Q) is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" Since both conditions are satisfied, we can conclude that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
