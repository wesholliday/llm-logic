            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance. This means that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence. Since it is also given that \"Mary was at the wedding,\" we can apply the conditional statement. Since the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, we can conclude that the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
