            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, the truth of the second part (Sue was at the wedding) does not provide any information about the truth of the first part (Mary was at the wedding). In logical terms, the truth of \"Sue was at the wedding\" does not imply that \"Mary was at the wedding\" must also be true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
