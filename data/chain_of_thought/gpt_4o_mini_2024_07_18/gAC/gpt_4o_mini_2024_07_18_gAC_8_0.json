            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented in logical terms as \"V \u2192 M\", where V is \"the vampire was awake\" and M is \"the mummy was awake\". This is a conditional statement. The second statement \"The mummy was awake\" can be represented as \"M is true\". \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is only false when the first part (the antecedent) is true and the second part (the consequent) is false. In this case, since we know that M is true, we cannot conclude anything about V directly from the first statement. The vampire could be awake or asleep, and the statement would still hold true because the condition only specifies what happens if the vampire is awake, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, knowing that the mummy is awake does not provide enough information to conclude that the vampire is also awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
