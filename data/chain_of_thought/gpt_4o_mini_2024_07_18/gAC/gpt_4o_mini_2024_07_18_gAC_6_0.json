This statement is true in two scenarios: when both P and Q are true, or when P is false and Q is true. \n\nIn this case, we know that \"Bob chose pasta\" (Q is true). However, the truth of Q does not provide definitive information about P. It is possible that Sue did not choose pizza (P is false), and Bob still chose pasta (Q is true). Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
