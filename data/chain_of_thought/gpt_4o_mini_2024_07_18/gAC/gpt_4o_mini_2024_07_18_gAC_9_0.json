            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee that the antecedent (P) is true if the consequent (Q) is true. In logical terms, the only time a conditional statement is false is when P is true and Q is false. Since we know that Q (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\") is true, we cannot conclude anything about P (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\"). Therefore, it does not follow that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
