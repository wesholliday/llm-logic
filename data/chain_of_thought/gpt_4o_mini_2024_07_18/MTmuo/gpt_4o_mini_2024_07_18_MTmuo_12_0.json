            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" can be interpreted as saying that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. In logical terms, this can be represented as \u00ac(L), where L is the proposition \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" can be expressed as J \u2192 L, where J is the proposition \"Joe went to the park.\" This is a conditional statement indicating that if Joe went to the park, then it necessarily follows that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we have:\n- From the first statement, we know that \u00ac(L) is true (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n- From the second statement, if J were true (Joe went to the park), then L would also have to be true (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nHowever, since we have established that \u00ac(L) is true (Lucy did not go to the zoo), it follows that J cannot be true. If J were true, it would lead to a contradiction because it would imply that L is also true. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
