            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, let's break them down logically.\n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" can be interpreted as saying that it is possible for the unicorn to not be in the forest. This means that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not a necessity.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" is a conditional statement. It suggests that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nNow, let's combine these two pieces of information. The first statement indicates that the unicorn does not necessarily have to be in the forest. If we assume that the griffin was in the forest, then according to the second statement, the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, since we know from the first statement that the unicorn does not have to be in the forest, this creates a contradiction if we assume the griffin was in the forest.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the griffin cannot be in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, it would force the unicorn to also be in the forest, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
