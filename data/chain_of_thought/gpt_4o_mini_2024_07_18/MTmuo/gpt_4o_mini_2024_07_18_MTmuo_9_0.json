            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be interpreted as saying that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. In logical terms, we can denote this as \u00ac(M \u2192 B), where M is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" and B is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This implies that there is at least one scenario where Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be expressed as L \u2192 M, where L is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and M is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, it necessarily follows that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we see that if Lisa did buy the red shirt (L is true), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (M is true). However, since we know from the first statement that it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (\u00ac(M \u2192 B)), it implies that Mark did not buy the blue shirt in at least one scenario.\n\nTherefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the implication L \u2192 M cannot hold true, which means Lisa cannot have bought the red shirt. Thus, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
