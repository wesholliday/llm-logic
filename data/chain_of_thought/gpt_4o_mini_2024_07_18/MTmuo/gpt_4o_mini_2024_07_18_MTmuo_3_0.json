            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the statements, let's break them down logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel,\" implies that the book could be something other than a mystery novel. This means that it is possible for the book to belong to a different genre.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel,\" is a conditional statement. It suggests that if the book is indeed written by James, then it necessarily follows that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel.\n- The second statement tells us that if the book were written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel.\n- Since we have established that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, it cannot be the case that the book was written by James (because if it were, it would have to be a mystery novel, which contradicts the first statement).\n\nThus, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
