            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" can be interpreted as saying that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that we cannot definitively conclude that Sue was present.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. It implies that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. \n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can analyze the implications. Since we know that it is possible for Sue not to be at the wedding (from the first statement), we can consider the implications of the second statement. If Mary were at the wedding, then according to the second statement, Sue must also be at the wedding. However, since we have established that it is possible for Sue not to be at the wedding, it follows that Mary cannot be at the wedding either. If Mary were at the wedding, it would create a contradiction because it would necessitate Sue being there as well, which we have established is not necessarily the case.\n\nThus, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
