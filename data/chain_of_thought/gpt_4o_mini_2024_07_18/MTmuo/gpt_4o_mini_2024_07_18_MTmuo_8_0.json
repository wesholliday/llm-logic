            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake,\" can be interpreted as saying that the mummy was not necessarily awake. This implies that the mummy could either be awake or asleep, but we cannot conclude definitively that it was awake.\n\n2. The second statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake,\" is a conditional statement. It means that the only way for the vampire to be awake is if the mummy is also awake.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can analyze the implications:\n\n- Since we know that the mummy does not have to be awake (from the first statement), it is possible that the mummy is asleep.\n- If the mummy is asleep, then according to the second statement, the vampire cannot be awake either, because if the vampire were awake, the mummy would have to be awake as well.\n\nThus, if the mummy is not awake, we can conclude that the vampire is also not awake. Therefore, we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
