            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" confirms Q. However, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In logical terms, just because Sue was at the wedding does not mean that Mary must also have been there. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
