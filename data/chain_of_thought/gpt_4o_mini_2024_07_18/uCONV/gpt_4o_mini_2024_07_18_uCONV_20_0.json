This does not imply the reverse, which would be \"If Q, then P\" (if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red). The reverse statement is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the banana to be yellow that do not involve the apple being red. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
