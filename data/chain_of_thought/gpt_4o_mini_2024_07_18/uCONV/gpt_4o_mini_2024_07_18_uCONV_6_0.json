This does not imply the reverse, which would be \"If Q, then P\" (if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza). The original statement only establishes a one-way relationship; it does not provide information about what happens if Bob chooses pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
