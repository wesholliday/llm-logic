This does not imply the reverse, which would be \"If Q, then P\" (if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate). The reverse statement is not necessarily true because there could be other scenarios where the muffins are blueberry without the cake being chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
