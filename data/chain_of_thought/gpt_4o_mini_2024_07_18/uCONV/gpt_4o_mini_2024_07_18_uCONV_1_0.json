            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented in logical terms as \"M \u2192 S\", where M is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S is \"Sue was at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement that indicates that the presence of Mary guarantees the presence of Sue. However, this does not imply the reverse; that is, the presence of Sue does not guarantee the presence of Mary. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" (S \u2192 M) based solely on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
