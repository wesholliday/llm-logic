However, it does not provide any information about the glorp being plonk. The phrase \"might be\" suggests uncertainty and does not imply that there are multiple possibilities being confirmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glorp might be either plonk or zizz based solely on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
