            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" The truth of this conditional statement does not imply that P must be true if Q is true. In fact, the truth of Q alone does not provide any information about the truth of P. \n\nIn this case, we know that Q (\"the truck was metal\") is true, but we cannot conclude anything about P (\"the doll was plastic\") based solely on the truth of Q. The doll could be plastic, or it could be made of another material; the truth of Q does not determine the truth of P.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"the doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
