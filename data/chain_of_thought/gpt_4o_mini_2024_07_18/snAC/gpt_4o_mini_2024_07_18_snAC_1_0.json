            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. The truth of this statement does not imply that P (Mary was at the wedding) must be true if Q (Sue was at the wedding) is true. In fact, the conditional statement can be true even if P is false, as long as Q is true. \n\nIn this case, we know that Q (Sue was at the wedding) is true, but we cannot conclude anything about P (Mary was at the wedding) based solely on the information given. Mary could have been at the wedding, or she could not have been; the truth of Sue being at the wedding does not provide definitive proof of Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
