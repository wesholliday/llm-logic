The first statement asserts that a grooble must be grazzle by grooble, which is a specific condition. The second statement adds an additional condition, \"and be wozzle flump,\" which is not present in the first statement. \n\nSince the first statement does not provide any information about \"wozzle flump,\" we cannot logically conclude that the grooble must also be wozzle flump based solely on the information given in the first statement. Therefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
