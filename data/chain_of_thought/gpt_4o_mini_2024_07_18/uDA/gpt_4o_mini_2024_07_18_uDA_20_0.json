In logic, if the premise (P) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the conclusion (Q). Therefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow just because the apple was not red. The banana could still be yellow or not yellow; we simply do not have enough information to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: no",
