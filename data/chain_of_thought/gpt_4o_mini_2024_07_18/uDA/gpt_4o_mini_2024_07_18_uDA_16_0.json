            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be understood as a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The second statement tells us that \"the shirt was not cotton,\" which means P is false. In logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the consequent (Q). Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the pants were not denim based solely on the information given. The pants could still be denim or they could be made of another material. Thus, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
