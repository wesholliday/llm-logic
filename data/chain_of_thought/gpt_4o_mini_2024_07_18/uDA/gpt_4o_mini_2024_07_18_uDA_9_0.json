            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement tells us that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which means P is false. In logic, if the premise (P) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the conclusion (Q). Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based solely on the information given. Mark could have bought the blue shirt or he could not have; we simply do not have enough information to determine that.\n\nAnswer: no",
