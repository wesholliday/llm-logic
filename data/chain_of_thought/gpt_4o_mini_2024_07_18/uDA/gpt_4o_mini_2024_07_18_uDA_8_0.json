In logic, the implication V \u2192 M does not provide information about M when V is false. This is because the implication only states what happens if V is true; it does not make any claims about M when V is false. \n\nIn other words, if the vampire is not awake (\u00acV), the mummy could either be awake (M) or not awake (\u00acM). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the mummy is not awake based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
