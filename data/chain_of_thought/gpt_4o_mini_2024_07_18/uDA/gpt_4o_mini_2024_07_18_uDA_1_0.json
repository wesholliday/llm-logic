            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be understood as a conditional statement. This means that the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the presence of Sue. However, the second statement tells us that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" In logic, when the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (the \"then\" part). Therefore, just because Mary was not at the wedding does not provide any information about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. Sue could still have been at the wedding regardless of Mary's absence. Thus, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
