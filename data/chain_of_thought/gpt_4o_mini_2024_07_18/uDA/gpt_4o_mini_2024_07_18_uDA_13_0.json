            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement, \"the car was not red,\" means that P is false. In logic, if the premise (P) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the conclusion (Q). Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue just because the car was not red. The truck could still be blue or not blue; we simply do not have enough information to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: no",
