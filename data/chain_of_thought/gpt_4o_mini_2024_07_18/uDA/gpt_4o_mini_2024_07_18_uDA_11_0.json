In logic, if the premise (P) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the conclusion (Q). Therefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry just because the cake was not chocolate. The muffins could still be blueberry or they could be a different flavor. \n\nAnswer: no",
