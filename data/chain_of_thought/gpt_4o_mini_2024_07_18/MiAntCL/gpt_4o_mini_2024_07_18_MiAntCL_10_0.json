            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The document might be signed\" indicates that there is a possibility of the document being signed, but it does not provide any information about whether it will also be notarized. Notarization is a separate process that involves a notary public verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing the signing of the document. Therefore, while it is possible for a document to be signed and notarized, the original statement does not imply that notarization is included in the possibility. Thus, we cannot infer that \"The document might be signed and notarized\" from the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
