However, it does not provide any information about the content of the exam, such as whether it will cover all chapters or just some of them. The addition of \"and cover all chapters\" introduces a new element that is not implied or supported by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the exam will cover all chapters based solely on the information given about its potential difficulty.\n\nAnswer: no",
