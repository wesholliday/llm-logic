    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information provided step by step. \n\n1. We know that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, and then soda, which is consumed much less in the mornings.\n2. The statement indicates that if tea does not retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee also does not retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Since it is stated that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, we can infer that it is highly probable that coffee will indeed retain the most drinkers.\n4. Because coffee is likely to retain the most drinkers, it follows that tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers either, as coffee's dominance suggests that tea cannot surpass it.\n5. The question asks if it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Given the initial conditions, if coffee does not retain the most drinkers, the only remaining option according to the logic provided is that soda would then take the lead, as tea is also not likely to retain the most drinkers.\n\nThus, it does follow that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
