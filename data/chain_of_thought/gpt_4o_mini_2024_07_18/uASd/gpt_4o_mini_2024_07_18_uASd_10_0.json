However, if the item is out of stock, it cannot be shipped regardless of whether an order has been placed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the item will ship if it is out of stock, even if an order is placed. The condition of the item being in stock is necessary for shipping to occur. \n\nAnswer: no",
