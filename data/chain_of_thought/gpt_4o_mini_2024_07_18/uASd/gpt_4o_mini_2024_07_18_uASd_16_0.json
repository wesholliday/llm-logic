            "content": "Explanation: The initial statement suggests that fertilizing the lawn leads to it being lush and green under normal conditions. However, the introduction of a drought introduces a significant variable that can affect the outcome. Drought conditions typically lead to water scarcity, which can severely hinder the growth of grass, regardless of whether it has been fertilized or not. Therefore, while fertilization is beneficial, it does not guarantee that the lawn will remain lush and green if there is insufficient water due to a drought. Thus, we cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green under drought conditions even if it has been fertilized.\n\nAnswer: no",
