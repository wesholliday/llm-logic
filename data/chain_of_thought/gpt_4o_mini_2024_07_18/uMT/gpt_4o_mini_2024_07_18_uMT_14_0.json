            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" can be understood as a conditional statement, which we can denote as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the bear is in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf is in the den.\" The second statement tells us that \"the wolf was not in the den,\" which means B is false. \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since we know the wolf is not in the den (B is false), we can infer that the bear is not in the cave (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
