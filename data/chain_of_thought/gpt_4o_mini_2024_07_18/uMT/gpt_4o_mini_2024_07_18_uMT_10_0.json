            "content": "Explanation: We start with the first statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \n\n- Let D represent \"the dog is inside.\"\n- Let C represent \"the cat is outside.\"\n\nThe statement can be written as: D \u2192 C (If D is true, then C is true).\n\nThe second statement tells us that \"the cat was not outside,\" which means C is false (\u00acC).\n\nNow, we can apply the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of D \u2192 C is \u00acC \u2192 \u00acD, which means \"if the cat is not outside, then the dog is not inside.\" Since we know \u00acC is true (the cat is not outside), we can conclude that \u00acD must also be true, meaning the dog is not inside.\n\nThus, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
