G \u2192 U (If G, then U)\n\nWe also have the information that \"the unicorn was not in the forest,\" which can be expressed as:\n\n2. \u00acU (Not U)\n\nNow, we can use these two statements to draw a conclusion. From statement 1 (G \u2192 U), if we know that U is false (\u00acU), we can apply the contrapositive of the implication. The contrapositive of \"G \u2192 U\" is \"\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\" (If not U, then not G). \n\nSince we have \u00acU (the unicorn is not in the forest), we can conclude \u00acG (the griffin is not in the forest). Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
