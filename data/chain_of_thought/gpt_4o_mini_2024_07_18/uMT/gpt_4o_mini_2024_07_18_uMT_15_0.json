            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be understood as a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true. The second part of the information states that \"Erin did not take a train.\" If Erin did not take a train, then the condition that Sam took a plane cannot be true, because that would contradict the initial statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
