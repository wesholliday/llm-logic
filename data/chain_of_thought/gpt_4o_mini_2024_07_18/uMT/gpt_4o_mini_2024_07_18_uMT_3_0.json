            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" can be understood as a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (the book being written by James) is true, then the second part (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true. The second part of the question states that \"the book is not a mystery novel.\" \n\nGiven that the book is not a mystery novel, we can apply a logical principle known as modus tollens. This principle states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). \n\nIn this case, we can let P be \"the book was written by James\" and Q be \"the book is a mystery novel.\" Since we know that Q (the book is a mystery novel) is false, we can conclude that P (the book was written by James) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
