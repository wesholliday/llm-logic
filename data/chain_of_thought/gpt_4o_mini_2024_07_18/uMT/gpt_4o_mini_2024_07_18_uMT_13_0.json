            "content": "Explanation: We are given a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as: \n\n- If P (the car is red), then Q (the truck is blue).\n\nWe are also given that the truck was not blue, which can be represented as:\n\n- Not Q (the truck is not blue).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement and the consequent (Q) is false (in this case, the truck is not blue), we can infer that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since the truck is not blue, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
