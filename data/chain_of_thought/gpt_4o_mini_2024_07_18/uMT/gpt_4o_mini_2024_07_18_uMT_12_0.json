            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be understood as a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement tells us that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\" In logic, if the conclusion Q is false (not Q), then the premise P must also be false (not P) in order for the conditional statement to hold true. Therefore, since Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
