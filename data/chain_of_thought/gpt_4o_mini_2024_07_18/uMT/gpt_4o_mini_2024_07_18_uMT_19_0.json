            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be understood as a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement tells us that \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement and the consequent (Q) is false (in this case, Jen did not watch basketball), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
