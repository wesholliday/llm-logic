If M is false (\u00acM is true), we can use the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"V \u2192 M\" is \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV,\" which means \"if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake.\"\n\nSince we know that \u00acM is true (the mummy is not awake), we can conclude that \u00acV must also be true (the vampire is not awake).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
