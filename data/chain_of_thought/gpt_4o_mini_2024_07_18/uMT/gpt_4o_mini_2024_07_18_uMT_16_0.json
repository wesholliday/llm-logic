            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be understood as a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true. The second statement tells us that \"the pants were not denim.\" \n\nIn logical terms, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the shirt is cotton\" and B is \"the pants are denim\"), and we know that B is false (the pants are not denim), we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive in logic, which states that if B is false, then A must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since the pants were not denim, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
