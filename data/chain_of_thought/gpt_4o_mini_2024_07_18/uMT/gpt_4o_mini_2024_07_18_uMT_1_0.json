This means that for Mary to be at the wedding, it is necessary for Sue to also be there. The second statement tells us that \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" Given that Sue's presence is a requirement for Mary's presence (as per the first statement), if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary cannot be at the wedding either. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
