The original statement is a conditional statement that asserts that crinking the snoogle is sufficient for plooking a nurp. \n\nThe new statement introduces an additional condition ('and a wug zites') to the original condition. In logical terms, adding a condition to a sufficient condition does not necessarily change the outcome of the original implication. However, it does mean that the new statement is more specific and requires both conditions to be true for the conclusion to hold. \n\nSince the original statement does not mention 'a wug zites', we cannot definitively conclude that the new statement is true based solely on the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
