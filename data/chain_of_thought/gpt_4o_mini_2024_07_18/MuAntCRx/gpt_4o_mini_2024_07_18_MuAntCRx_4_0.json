The original statement only asserts that the glorp is in the flibbit blimp, which does not provide any information about the glorp's presence in the plonk wump. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the glorp is in both locations based solely on the information given. The presence in one location does not imply presence in another unless explicitly stated or logically deduced.\n\nAnswer: no",
