    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the situation, we need to break down the qualifications and the implications of the applicants' standings. The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect. Since there is only one position available, the outcomes depend on the qualifications and the likelihood of each applicant getting the position.\n\n1. The jantiz is the most qualified and is likely to get the zulision. This suggests that the probability of the jantiz receiving the position is high.\n2. If the jantiz does not get the position, the cramen, being the next most qualified, would typically be the next in line. However, the statement indicates that the cramen likely won't get the position either.\n3. If both the jantiz and the cramen do not get the position, the only remaining applicant is the sulect. Therefore, if the jantiz does not get the zulision, and the cramen also does not get it, the sulect will automatically receive the position.\n\nGiven that the jantiz is likely to get the position, it follows that the cramen is likely not to get it. However, if we consider the scenario where the jantiz does not get the position, it leads us to conclude that the sulect will indeed get the position, as the cramen is also unlikely to secure it.\n\nThus, it is likely that if the jantiz does not get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
