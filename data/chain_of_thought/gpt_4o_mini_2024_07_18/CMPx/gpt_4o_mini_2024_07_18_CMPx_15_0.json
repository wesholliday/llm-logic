    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the situation, we need to break down the information provided. We know that the fantole is the most likely to win the Rizzle Cup, followed by the dribban, and the snorpul is a longshot. The statement also indicates that if the dribban does not win, then the snorpul will win only if the fantole does not win. \n\nGiven that the fantole is likely to win, it implies that the dribban is unlikely to win. If the dribban does not win, we then consider the condition: if the fantole also does not win, then the snorpul must win. \n\nSince the fantole is likely to win, the scenario where the fantole does not win is less probable. However, if we assume that the fantole does not win, the only outcome left for the dribban is that it also does not win (since it is unlikely to win), which leads us to conclude that the snorpul must win. \n\nThus, it follows logically that if the fantole does not win, the snorpul will win, given the conditions set forth. Therefore, it is likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
