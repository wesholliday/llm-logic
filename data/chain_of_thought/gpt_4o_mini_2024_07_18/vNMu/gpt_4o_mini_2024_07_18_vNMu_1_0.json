            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premise and the conclusion. The premise states, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" which can be interpreted as saying that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. This implies that there is at least one scenario where Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nThe conclusion states, \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" which suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding. \n\nIn logical terms, if it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, it logically follows that there is a possibility that she was not there. Therefore, the premise supports the conclusion, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
