The first statement is \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\" This tells us that the condition of the fleeg being bluttered is false.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This means that the only way for the fleeg to surn is if it was bluttered. \n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" we can conclude that the condition for the fleeg to surn (which is being bluttered) is not met. Therefore, it follows logically that the fleeg cannot surn because the prerequisite (being bluttered) is false.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
