Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) (the first statement)\n- \\( \\neg B \\) (the second statement)\n\nSince \\( B \\) (the smip must be lupped) is false, we can conclude that \\( A \\) (the smip is shripped) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
