            "content": "Explanation: We start with two statements:\n\n1. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"the splat is morphed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the splat must be quanked\").\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This can be expressed as: \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical reasoning technique known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true.\n\nFrom the first statement \\( P \\lor Q \\) and the second statement \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
