Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true.\n\nFrom the first statement \\( P \\lor Q \\), we know that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true. The second statement \\( \\neg Q \\) tells us that \\( Q \\) is false. Therefore, by disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
