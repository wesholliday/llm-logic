            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was awake.\" The second statement, \"The vampire was not awake,\" can be expressed as \"not A.\" In logic, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know that A is false (not A), we cannot directly conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional statement does not provide information about what happens when A is false; B could be true or false. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The mummy was not awake\" (not B) from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
