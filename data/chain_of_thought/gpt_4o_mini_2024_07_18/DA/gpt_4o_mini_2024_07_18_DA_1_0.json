            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The second statement, \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" means that P is false. In logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (Q). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding\" based solely on the information given. The truth of Q (Sue being at the wedding) remains undetermined when P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
