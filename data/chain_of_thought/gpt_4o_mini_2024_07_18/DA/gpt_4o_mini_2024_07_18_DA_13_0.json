            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement \"The car was not red\" negates P. In logic, the negation of the antecedent (P) does not allow us to conclude anything about the consequent (Q). This means that just because the car is not red, we cannot infer that the truck is not blue. The truck could still be blue or it could be any other color. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
