            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement \"The apple was not red\" means that P is false. In logic, a conditional statement is only false when the first part (P) is true and the second part (Q) is false. However, if P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q; it could be true or false. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow.\" \n\nAnswer: no",
