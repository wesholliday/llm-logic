            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement, \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" can be expressed as \"not P.\" In logic, when we have a conditional statement and the antecedent (P) is false (not P), we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (Q). This means that even though Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot definitively say that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
