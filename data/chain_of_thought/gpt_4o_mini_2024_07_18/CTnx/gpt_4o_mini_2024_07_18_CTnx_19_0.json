            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk did not plagged.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the smonk plagged (not Q), then the smonk was not vreebled (not P).\" This is indeed the statement we are trying to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
