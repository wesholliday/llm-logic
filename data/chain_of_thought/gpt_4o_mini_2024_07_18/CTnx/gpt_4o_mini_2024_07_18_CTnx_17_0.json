            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob did not movated.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as P \u2192 \u00acQ. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\" \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the flob movated (\u00acQ), then the flob was not skizzled (\u00acP).\" This is exactly what we are trying to infer. Therefore, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
