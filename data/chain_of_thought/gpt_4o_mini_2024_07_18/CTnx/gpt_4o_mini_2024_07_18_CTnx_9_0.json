            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"P \u2192 \u00acV\", where P represents \"the twonk was plinked\" and V represents \"the twonk was varnished\". This means that if the twonk is plinked, it cannot be varnished. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" (which can be expressed as \"V \u2192 \u00acP\"), we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 \u00acV\" is \"V \u2192 \u00acP\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nSince the contrapositive is a valid inference from the original statement, we can conclude that if the twonk was varnished, then it was indeed not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
