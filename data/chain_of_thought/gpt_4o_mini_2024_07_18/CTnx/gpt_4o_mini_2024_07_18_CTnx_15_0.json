            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was not spened.\" This can be rewritten as \"If P, then not Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the dreb was spened (Q), then the dreb was not vroombed (not P).\" Therefore, we can indeed infer that if the dreb was spened, then it was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
