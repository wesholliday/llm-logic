            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quank\"). The contrapositive of this statement is logically equivalent and can be expressed as \"If Q, then not P\" (which translates to \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\"). Since the contrapositive is a valid inference from the original statement, we can conclude that the statement \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
