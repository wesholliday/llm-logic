            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip did not lup the zoint.\" This can be rewritten as \"If the smip was shripped (P), then the smip did not lup the zoint (not Q).\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the smip lupped the zoint (not Q), then the smip was not shripped (not P),\" we can apply the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and both statements are logically equivalent.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the smip lup the zoint (not Q), then the smip was not shripped (not P).\" Therefore, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
