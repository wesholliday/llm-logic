            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg did not sproted the frink.\" This can be rewritten as \"If A, then not B.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If B is false (the sneg sproted the frink), then A is false (the sneg was not crampled).\" This is a valid logical inference because the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
