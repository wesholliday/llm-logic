            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then not B,\" where A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"the fleeg surned.\" This can be rewritten as \"If A, then not B\" or \"A \u2192 \u00acB.\" The contrapositive of this statement is logically equivalent and can be expressed as \"If B, then not A,\" or \"B \u2192 \u00acA.\" \n\nIn this case, if we let \"the fleeg surned\" be represented as B, then the contrapositive would indeed be \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered,\" which is what we are trying to infer. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
