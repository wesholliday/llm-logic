            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" establishes a direct relationship between getting enough sleep and not feeling tired. However, the second statement introduces an additional condition: doing hard labor. The relationship between sleep and tiredness can be affected by various factors, including physical exertion. While getting enough sleep is likely to reduce tiredness, engaging in hard labor can lead to fatigue regardless of sleep quality. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that getting enough sleep while also doing hard labor will prevent tiredness, as the physical demands of hard labor may counteract the benefits of sufficient sleep.\n\nAnswer: no",
