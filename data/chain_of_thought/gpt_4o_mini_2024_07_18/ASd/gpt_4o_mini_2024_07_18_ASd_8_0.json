            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today\" establishes a conditional relationship between the package being shipped and its arrival today. However, the new statement introduces an additional condition: \"and it was misrouted.\" The introduction of this new condition complicates the original statement because misrouting could potentially prevent the package from arriving today, even if it has shipped. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the package will still arrive today if it has been misrouted, as the original statement does not account for this possibility. \n\nAnswer: no",
