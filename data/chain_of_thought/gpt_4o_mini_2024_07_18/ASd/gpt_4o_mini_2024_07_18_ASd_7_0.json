            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" establishes a direct relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen's temperature. However, the new statement introduces an additional condition: \"and the pilot light is out.\" The pilot light being out could imply that the oven is not functioning properly, which may prevent it from heating the kitchen. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the kitchen will still be warm if the oven is on but the pilot light is out. The original statement does not account for the functionality of the oven, so we cannot infer the new statement as true.\n\nAnswer: no",
