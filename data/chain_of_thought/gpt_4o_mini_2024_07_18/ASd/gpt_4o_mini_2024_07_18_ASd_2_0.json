            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time\" establishes a conditional relationship between attending the concert and having a good time. It implies that going to the concert is sufficient for having a good time, but it does not account for any external factors that could affect that outcome, such as a bomb going off. \n\nIn logic, the introduction of an additional condition (like a bomb going off) can change the outcome of the original statement. The new statement \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" introduces a scenario that is likely to negate the positive outcome of having a good time, as a bomb going off would typically create a dangerous and distressing situation, making it unlikely for anyone to have a good time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one, as the additional condition fundamentally alters the context and outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
