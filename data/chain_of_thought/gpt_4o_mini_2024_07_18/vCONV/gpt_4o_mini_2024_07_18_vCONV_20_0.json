            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion. The premise states \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the banana was yellow\"). The conclusion states \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red,\" which can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\nIn logic, the form \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the first statement is true does not mean that the reverse is true. For example, it is possible for the apple to be red and the banana to be yellow, but it does not mean that if the banana is yellow, the apple must be red. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
