            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion. The premise states, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim\"). The conclusion states, \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton,\" which can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because the first statement is true does not mean that the reverse is true. For example, it is possible for the pants to be denim without the shirt being cotton, which would make the conclusion false even if the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
