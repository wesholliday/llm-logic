            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" which can be represented in logical terms as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (where \\( V \\) is \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) is \"the mummy was awake\"). The conclusion states, \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake,\" which can be represented as \\( M \\rightarrow V \\).\n\nIn logical reasoning, the form of the argument is important. The premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) does not imply \\( M \\rightarrow V \\). This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because the first statement is true does not mean that the reverse is also true. For example, it is possible for the mummy to be awake without the vampire being awake, which would make the conclusion false even if the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
