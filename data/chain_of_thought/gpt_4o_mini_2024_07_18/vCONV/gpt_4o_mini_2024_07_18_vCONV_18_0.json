            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion. The premise states, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal\"). The conclusion states, \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic,\" which can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\nIn logic, the form of the argument is known as the converse. The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply its converse \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). For example, it is possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false. A simple counterexample would be if the doll is plastic (making the premise true) and the truck is made of a different material (making the conclusion false). Therefore, the argument is not valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
