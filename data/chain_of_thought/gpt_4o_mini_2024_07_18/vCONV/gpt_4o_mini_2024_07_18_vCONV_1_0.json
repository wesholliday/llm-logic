            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as M \u2192 S (where M is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The conclusion states, \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as S \u2192 M.\n\nIn logical terms, the premise M \u2192 S does not imply the conclusion S \u2192 M. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because Mary being at the wedding guarantees that Sue is also there, it does not mean that Sue being at the wedding guarantees that Mary is there. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example: If Mary is a bride and Sue is a guest, the premise holds true (if the bride is present, then guests are present), but the conclusion does not necessarily hold (a guest could be present without the bride being there). Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
