            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and conclusion. The premise states, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Amy played tennis\"). The conclusion states, \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball,\" which can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\nIn logic, the form of the argument is important. The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because the first statement is true does not mean that the reverse is true. For example, it is possible for Amy to play tennis without Jeff playing basketball, which would make the conclusion false even if the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
