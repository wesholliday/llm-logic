            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" asserts that the delivery occurred on the specific day mentioned, which is today. The phrase \"or tomorrow\" introduces an alternative possibility that the package could also be delivered tomorrow. However, since the original statement confirms that the delivery has already taken place today, it does not logically support the idea that it could also be delivered tomorrow. The original statement does not allow for the possibility of delivery on a later date, as it is definitive about today. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered today or tomorrow based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
