The phrase \"or after meals\" introduces an alternative that is not included in the original statement. Therefore, while it is possible that the medicine could also be taken after meals, the original statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that it must have been taken either with food or after meals. The original statement only confirms the necessity of taking it with food, not after meals. \n\nAnswer: no",
