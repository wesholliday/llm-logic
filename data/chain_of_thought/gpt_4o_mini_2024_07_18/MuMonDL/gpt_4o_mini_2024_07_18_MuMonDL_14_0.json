            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year\" indicates that the minimum duration of validity for the contract is one year. However, it does not explicitly state that the contract cannot be valid for a longer period. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if a contract is valid for a year, it could also be valid for a longer duration. The phrase \"or longer\" suggests that the validity could extend beyond one year, which aligns with the initial statement. Thus, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
