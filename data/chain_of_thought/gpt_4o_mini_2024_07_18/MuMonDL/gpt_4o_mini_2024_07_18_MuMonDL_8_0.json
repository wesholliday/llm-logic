            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" indicates a specific condition regarding the restaurant's operation on that day. The inference \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" introduces an additional possibility (having limited hours) that is not explicitly stated in the original statement. While it is true that if the restaurant was closed, it could also imply that it had limited hours on other days, the original statement does not provide any information about the hours of operation on days other than Monday. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer the second statement from the first, as it introduces a new condition that is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
