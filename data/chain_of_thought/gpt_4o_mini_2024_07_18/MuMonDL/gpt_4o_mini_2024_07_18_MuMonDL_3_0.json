            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys must be in the drawer\" asserts a specific location for the keys, indicating that they are definitely in the drawer. The statement \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table\" introduces an alternative location (the table) but does not negate the original assertion. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the keys being on the table; it only confirms their presence in the drawer. Therefore, while the second statement is logically consistent with the first (since if the keys are in the drawer, they can also be said to be either in the drawer or on the table), it does not follow directly from the first statement alone. \n\nAnswer: yes",
