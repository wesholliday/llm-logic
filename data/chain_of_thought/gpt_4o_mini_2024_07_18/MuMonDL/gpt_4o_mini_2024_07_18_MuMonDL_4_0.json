            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM\" indicates a specific time for the meeting. The phrase \"or been rescheduled\" introduces an alternative scenario where the meeting could have been moved to a different time. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of rescheduling; it only confirms the initial schedule. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the meeting could have been rescheduled based solely on the information given in the first statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
