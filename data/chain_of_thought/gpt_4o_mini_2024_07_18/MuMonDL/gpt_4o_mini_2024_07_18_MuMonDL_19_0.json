            "content": "Explanation: The original statement specifies that \"The application must have been completed online.\" This indicates that the application process requires completion through an online platform. The phrase \"submitted electronically\" could imply that the application can be submitted via email or another electronic method, which may not necessarily mean it was completed online. Therefore, while both phrases involve electronic processes, they are not equivalent. The original statement does not support the idea that the application could be submitted electronically if it was not completed online. Thus, we cannot infer that the application must have been completed online or submitted electronically based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
