            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The document might be signed or notarized\" indicates that there are two possibilities regarding the document: it could either be signed, or it could be notarized, or it could potentially be both. The use of \"might\" suggests that there is uncertainty about whether either action will occur. Since \"signed\" is one of the options presented, it is reasonable to infer that if the document might be notarized, it also might be signed. Therefore, we can conclude that it is indeed possible for the document to be signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
