The use of the word \"might\" suggests that both options are possibilities, but it does not confirm that either will definitely happen. Therefore, while it is possible that the package could be delivered today, it is not certain. The phrase does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the package will be delivered today, only that it is one of the potential options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
