            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" presents two possibilities regarding the restaurant's operation on Mondays. The use of \"might\" indicates that both scenarios are uncertain. Therefore, while it is possible that the restaurant is closed on Mondays, it is also possible that it is open for limited hours. Since the statement does not confirm either scenario definitively, we cannot conclusively infer that the restaurant is closed on Mondays; we can only say that it is a possibility. \n\nAnswer: yes",
