It does not mention anything about the type of cuisine served by the restaurant. Therefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant served Italian cuisine based solely on the information that it was closed on Monday. The two pieces of information are independent, and the addition of the cuisine type is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
