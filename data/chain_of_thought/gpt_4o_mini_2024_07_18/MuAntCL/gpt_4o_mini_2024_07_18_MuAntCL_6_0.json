            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" provides information only about the ticket availability for the concert, indicating that all tickets were sold. However, it does not provide any information regarding the time the concert started. The addition of \"and started at 8 PM\" introduces a new piece of information that is not contained in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert started at 8 PM based solely on the information that it was sold out.\n\nAnswer: no",
