However, it does not provide any information about whether the software was also restarted after the update. Restarting software is a separate action that may or may not be necessary depending on the specific software and the nature of the update. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the software was also restarted based solely on the information that it was updated.\n\nAnswer: no",
