            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The document must have been signed\" indicates that there is a requirement or necessity for the document to have a signature. However, the addition of \"and notarized\" introduces a new requirement that is not implied by the original statement. Notarization is a separate process that involves a notary public verifying the identity of the signers and witnessing the signing of the document. Therefore, while the document being signed is a necessary condition, it does not automatically imply that it has also been notarized. Thus, we cannot infer that the document must have been both signed and notarized based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
