            "content": "Explanation: The original statement presents two possibilities: that the fish might be in the aquarium and that the fish might be swimming. However, it does not explicitly connect these two possibilities. The fish could be in the aquarium and not swimming, or it could be swimming but not necessarily in the aquarium.
