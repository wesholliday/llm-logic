            "content": "Explanation: The original statement presents two possibilities: that the restaurant might be expensive and that it might be busy. The use of \"might\" indicates that both conditions are uncertain and independent of each other. When we combine these two possibilities into one statement, \"The restaurant might be expensive and busy,\" we are essentially saying that both conditions could potentially be true at the same time. Since the original statement allows for both conditions to exist simultaneously, we can infer that it is possible for the restaurant to be both expensive and busy. \n\nAnswer: yes",
