            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" This contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can indeed infer that if the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
