            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" \n\nSince a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: yes",
