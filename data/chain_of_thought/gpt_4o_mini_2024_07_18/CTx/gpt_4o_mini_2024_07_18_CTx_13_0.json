            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged.\" This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
