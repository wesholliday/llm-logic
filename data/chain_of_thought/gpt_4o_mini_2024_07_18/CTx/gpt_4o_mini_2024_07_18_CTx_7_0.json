            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it translates to \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" \n\nSince a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
