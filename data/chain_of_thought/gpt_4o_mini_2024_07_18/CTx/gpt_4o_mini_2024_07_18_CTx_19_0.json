            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk plagged.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as P \u2192 Q. The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). \n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. In this case, if it is true that \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" then it must also be true that \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\" \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
