            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it translates to \"If the grommet did not plop the frink (not Q), then the grommet was not sploffed (not P).\" \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" \n\nAnswer: yes",
