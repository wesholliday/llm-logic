            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink (not B), then the sneg was not crampled (not A).\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer that if the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
