            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it translates to \"If the wug did not bim the zoint (not Q), then the wug was not flooped (not P).\" \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the new statement from the original one. \n\nAnswer: yes",
