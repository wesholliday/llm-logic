            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
