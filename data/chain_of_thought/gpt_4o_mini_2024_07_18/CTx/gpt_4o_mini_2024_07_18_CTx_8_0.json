            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" \n\nSince a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement. Therefore, the statement \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
