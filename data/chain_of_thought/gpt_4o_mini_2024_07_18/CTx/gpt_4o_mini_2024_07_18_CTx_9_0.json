            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"P implies V\" (P \u2192 V), where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and V is \"the twonk was varnished.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked,\" which can be expressed as \"not V implies not P\" (\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
