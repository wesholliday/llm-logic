            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" \n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer that \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
