            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it would be \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" \n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
