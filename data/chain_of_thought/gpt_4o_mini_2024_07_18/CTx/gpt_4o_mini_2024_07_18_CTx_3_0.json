            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it translates to \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\" \n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: yes",
