It means that being written by James is a sufficient condition for the book being a mystery novel. However, the fact that \"the book is a mystery novel\" does not provide enough information to conclude that it was necessarily written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book was written by James based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
