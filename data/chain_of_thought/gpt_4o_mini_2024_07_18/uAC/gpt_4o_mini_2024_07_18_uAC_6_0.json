It means that Sue choosing pizza is a sufficient condition for Bob choosing pasta. However, the reverse is not necessarily true; just because Bob chose pasta does not mean that Sue must have chosen pizza. The fact that Bob chose pasta does not provide any information about Sue's choice. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
