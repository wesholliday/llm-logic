The second statement \"Kate ate salad\" confirms Q is true. However, in logic, just because Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
