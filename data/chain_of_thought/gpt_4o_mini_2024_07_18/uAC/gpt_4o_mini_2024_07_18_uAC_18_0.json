This means that the truth of the first part (the doll being plastic) guarantees the truth of the second part (the truck being metal). However, the reverse is not necessarily true. The fact that \"the truck was metal\" does not provide any information about the doll's material. The doll could be plastic, but it could also be made of another material. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
