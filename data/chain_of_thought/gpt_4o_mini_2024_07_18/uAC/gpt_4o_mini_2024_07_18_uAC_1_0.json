            "content": "Explanation: The statements provided can be analyzed using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. The second statement confirms that \"Sue was at the wedding.\" However, this does not provide direct evidence about Mary's presence. The conditional statement does not imply that if Sue is present, then Mary must also be present. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
