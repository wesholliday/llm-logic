This means that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true. However, the fact that \"the pants were denim\" does not provide enough information to conclude that \"the shirt was cotton.\" The pants being denim could be true for other reasons unrelated to the shirt's material. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
