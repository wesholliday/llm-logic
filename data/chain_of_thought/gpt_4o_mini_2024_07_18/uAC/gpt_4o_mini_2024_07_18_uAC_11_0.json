This means that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, the fact that \"the muffins were blueberry\" does not necessarily imply that the cake was chocolate. It is possible for the muffins to be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
