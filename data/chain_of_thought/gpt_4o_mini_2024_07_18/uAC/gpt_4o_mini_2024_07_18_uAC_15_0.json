This means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true. However, the fact that \"Erin took a train\" does not provide enough information to conclude that \"Sam took a plane.\" The conditional statement does not imply the reverse; just because Erin took a train does not mean that Sam must have taken a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
