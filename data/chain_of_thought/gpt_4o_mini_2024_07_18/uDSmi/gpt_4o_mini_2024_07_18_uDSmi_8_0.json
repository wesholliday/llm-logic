            "content": "Explanation: The statement presents two possibilities regarding the location of the remote control: it is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. Additionally, it states that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This means that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, which would leave the only other option available, that is, the remote control must be on the coffee table. Since one of the two options must be true and the possibility of it being under the couch is negated, we can conclude that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
