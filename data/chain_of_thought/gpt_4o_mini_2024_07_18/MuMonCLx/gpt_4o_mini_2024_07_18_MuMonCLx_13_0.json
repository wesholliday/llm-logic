However, the phrase 'The flimble must be in frozz' is a part of the original statement. Since the original statement asserts that the flimble is indeed in frozz (as it is part of the conjunction), we can infer that 'The flimble must be in frozz' is true based on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
