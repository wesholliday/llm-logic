However, the statement does not provide any information about notarization. Notarization is a separate process that may or may not be required depending on the context or legal requirements of the document. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized or signed based solely on the information given. The original statement only confirms that the document was signed, not that it was notarized. \n\nAnswer: no",
