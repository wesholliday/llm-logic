            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" indicates that the event meets the criteria of being formal. If something is formal, it does not necessarily imply that it is also semi-formal; rather, it strictly adheres to the formal classification. Therefore, while a formal event could be considered more formal than a semi-formal event, it does not allow us to conclude that it could also be semi-formal. The inference that \"The event must have been semi-formal or formal\" introduces the possibility of being semi-formal, which is not supported by the original statement. Thus, we cannot infer that the event was semi-formal based solely on the information that it was formal.\n\nAnswer: no",
