            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure. The argument can be represented in a logical form as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding (M), then Sue was at the wedding (S). This can be written as M \u2192 S.\n2. Premise 2: Sue was at the wedding (S). This is simply S.\n3. Conclusion: Mary was at the wedding (M).\n\nIn logical terms, the argument can be summarized as:\n- M \u2192 S (If M, then S)\n- S (S is true)\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot conclude that M is true. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but it does not state that Mary being at the wedding is the only condition for Sue being there. Sue could have been at the wedding for other reasons, and thus Mary\u2019s presence is not guaranteed by Sue's presence. This is a classic example of the fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
