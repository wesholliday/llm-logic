            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If I water the plants, they will grow,\" which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"I water the plants\" and \\( Q \\) is \"they will grow\"). The conclusion states, \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow,\" which can be represented as \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( R \\) is \"there is no sunlight\").\n\nTo assess the validity, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about the effect of sunlight on the growth of the plants. Therefore, the presence or absence of sunlight (represented by \\( R \\)) does not affect the truth of the conclusion. The conclusion assumes that even with the condition of no sunlight, the plants will still grow if they are watered, which is not guaranteed by the premise alone.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise does not imply that watering the plants alone is sufficient for them to grow without sunlight.\n\nAnswer: no",
