            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games,\" which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"I finish my homework\" and \\( Q \\) is \"I can play video games.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games,\" which can be represented as \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( R \\) is \"my computer catches on fire.\" \n\nIn logical terms, the conclusion introduces an additional condition (the computer catching on fire) but does not change the original implication of the premise. The truth of \\( Q \\) (being able to play video games) still depends solely on \\( P \\) (finishing homework). The presence of \\( R \\) does not affect the truth of \\( Q \\) if \\( P \\) is true. \n\nThus, the argument is valid because if the premise is true (I finish my homework), then regardless of whether \\( R \\) is true or false, \\( Q \\) (I can play video games) must also be true. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
