            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\nP \u2192 Q, where P is \"you get enough sleep\" and Q is \"you won't be tired.\"\n\nThe conclusion states, \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\" This can be represented as:\n\n(P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q, where R is \"you do hard labor.\"\n\nTo assess the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise only establishes a relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired. It does not provide any information about the effect of doing hard labor on tiredness. Therefore, the conclusion introduces a new variable (doing hard labor) that is not accounted for in the premise.\n\nIn logical terms, just because you get enough sleep does not guarantee that you won't be tired if you also do hard labor. The premise does not imply that the combination of getting enough sleep and doing hard labor will lead to not being tired. Thus, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
