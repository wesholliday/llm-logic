            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the match is struck, then it will light.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the match is struck\" and \\( Q \\) is \"it will light.\" \n\nThe conclusion states, \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.\" This can be expressed as \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( R \\) is \"the match has been soaked in water.\" \n\nTo assess the validity, we need to consider whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. The premise only asserts that striking the match will cause it to light, without any conditions regarding the state of the match (e.g., whether it has been soaked in water). If the match has been soaked in water, it is reasonable to conclude that it may not light even if it is struck. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the soaked condition introduces a factor that could prevent the match from lighting.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the premise does not support the conclusion under the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: no",
