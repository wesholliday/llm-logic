            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This means that whenever the dreb is vroombed, it must also be spened. The second statement asserts that \"The dreb was vroombed.\" Since the first statement establishes a direct relationship between the two conditions, we can conclude that because the dreb was indeed vroombed, it follows that the dreb must also be spened. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was spened.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
