            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\" The second statement asserts that \"the splat was morphed,\" which means P is true. In logic, if P is true and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, since we know that the splat was morphed, we can infer that the splat quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
