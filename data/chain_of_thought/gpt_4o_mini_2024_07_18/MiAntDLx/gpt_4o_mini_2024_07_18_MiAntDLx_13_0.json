            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wozzle might be in zooble or gribble\" presents two possibilities: that the wozzle could be in either zooble or gribble. The use of \"might\" indicates that it is uncertain where the wozzle actually is, but it is possible for it to be in either location. Therefore, it is logically valid to infer that \"The wozzle might be in zooble\" is a true statement, as it is one of the two options presented. \n\nAnswer: yes",
