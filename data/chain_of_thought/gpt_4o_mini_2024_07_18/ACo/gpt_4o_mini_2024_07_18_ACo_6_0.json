The second statement is a conditional statement that suggests if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. However, the truth of the first statement does not provide any information about whether Sue actually chose pizza or not. \n\nIn logical terms, the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is \"Bob chose pasta\") can be true even if A is false. Since we know that Bob chose pasta (B is true), we cannot conclude anything about A (whether Sue chose pizza) based solely on the information given. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza from the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
