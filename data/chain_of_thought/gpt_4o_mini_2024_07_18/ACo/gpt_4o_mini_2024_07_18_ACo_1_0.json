            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the statements provided, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. \n\n1. The first statement is 'Sue was at the wedding.' This tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is confirmed.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.' This means that Mary's presence at the wedding would imply Sue's presence, but it does not state that Mary must be at the wedding for Sue to be there.\n\nSince we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding, this does not provide any information about whether Mary was there or not. The conditional statement does not allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was. In logical terms, the truth of the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is not necessary for the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) to be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'Mary was at the wedding' based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
