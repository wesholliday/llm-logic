            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The blimple might be on the flump\" suggests a possibility regarding the location of the blimple, specifically that it is on the flump. The phrase \"or in the wobble\" introduces an additional possibility regarding the blimple's location. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the blimple being in the wobble; it only discusses the possibility of it being on the flump. Therefore, while the new statement includes the original possibility, it adds an entirely new location (the wobble) that is not supported by the original statement. Thus, we cannot definitively infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
