            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The zibber might be froodle or on wibble' from 'The zibber might be froodle', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The original statement 'The zibber might be froodle' suggests that there is a possibility that the zibber is in the state of being froodle. However, the addition of 'or on wibble' introduces a new possibility that is not present in the original statement. \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not provide any information about the state of being 'on wibble'. Therefore, while it is true that the zibber might be froodle, we cannot conclude that it might also be on wibble based solely on the information given. The original statement does not imply the truth of the second part of the new statement.\n\nThus, we cannot infer 'The zibber might be froodle or on wibble' from 'The zibber might be froodle'.\n\nAnswer: no",
