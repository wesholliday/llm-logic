            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" which suggests that there is a possibility that she was not present. The conclusion states, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" which implies that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nIn logical terms, the premise indicates that there is at least one scenario where Mary is not at the wedding, which directly supports the conclusion that it is not a certainty (or necessity) that she was there. If there is a possibility that she was not at the wedding, then it follows that it cannot be said with certainty that she must have been there.\n\nThus, the argument is valid because the premise logically leads to the conclusion. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
