            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n1. If A (the apple is red), then B (the banana is yellow).\n\nThe second premise states, \"The apple was not red,\" which can be represented as:\n\n2. Not A (the apple is not red).\n\nThe conclusion drawn from these premises is \"The banana was not yellow,\" which can be represented as:\n\nC: Not B (the banana is not yellow).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the validity of the argument. The structure of the argument can be analyzed using the rules of logic, specifically the concept of modus tollens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"Not B\" is true, then \"Not A\" must also be true. However, in this case, we have \"Not A\" (the apple is not red) and we cannot conclude \"Not B\" (the banana is not yellow) from it. \n\nIn fact, the first premise does not provide any information about the banana's color when the apple is not red. The banana could still be yellow or not yellow regardless of the apple's color. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
