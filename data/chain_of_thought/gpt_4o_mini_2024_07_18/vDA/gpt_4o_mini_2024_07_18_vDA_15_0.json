            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\" The second premise states, \"Sam did not take a plane,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\). The conclusion is \"Erin did not take a train,\" represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logical terms, the argument can be summarized as follows:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n2. \\( \\neg P \\) (Sam did not take a plane)\n3. Therefore, \\( \\neg Q \\) (Erin did not take a train)\n\nThis form of reasoning is known as denying the antecedent. The structure of denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. Just because Sam did not take a plane does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train. There could be other reasons or circumstances under which Erin could still take a train regardless of Sam's actions.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
