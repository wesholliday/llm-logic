            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo\"). The second premise states, \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" represented as \\( \\neg Q \\). \n\nTo assess the validity, we can apply the rules of logic. The form of the argument is an example of denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The structure is as follows:\n\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\n2. \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park)\n3. Therefore, \\( \\neg Q \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo)\n\nThis reasoning is invalid because the first premise does not provide sufficient information to conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo just because Joe did not go to the park. It is possible for Lucy to have gone to the zoo regardless of Joe's actions.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
