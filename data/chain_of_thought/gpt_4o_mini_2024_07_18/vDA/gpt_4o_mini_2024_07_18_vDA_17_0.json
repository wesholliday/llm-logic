            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\" The second premise states, \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\). The conclusion is \"Kate did not eat salad,\" represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logical reasoning, the form of the argument can be summarized as follows:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n2. \\( \\neg P \\) (Not P)\n3. Therefore, \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not Q)\n\nThis form of reasoning is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a logical fallacy. Just because Ben did not eat pasta (the antecedent is false), it does not necessarily follow that Kate did not eat salad. There could be other reasons or circumstances under which Kate could still have eaten salad. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
