            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n1. If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck was metal).\n\nThe second premise states, \"The doll was not plastic,\" which can be represented as:\n\n2. Not P (the doll was not plastic).\n\nThe conclusion drawn from these premises is: \n\nC. Not Q (the truck was not metal).\n\nTo assess the validity, we can apply the rules of logic. The argument follows a form known as \"modus tollens,\" which states that if we have \"If P then Q\" and \"Not P,\" we cannot conclude \"Not Q.\" In fact, the truth of Q is independent of the truth of P in this case. The first premise only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic; it does not provide information about what happens if the doll is not plastic. Therefore, the conclusion that \"the truck was not metal\" does not logically follow from the premises provided.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
