            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P, then Q)\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second premise states, \"Tom did not watch football,\" which can be represented as:\n\n2. \\( \\neg P \\) (Not P)\n\nThe conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which can be represented as:\n\n3. \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not Q)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The form of reasoning used here is known as \"modus tollens,\" which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg P \\) is true, we cannot conclude \\( \\neg Q \\). In fact, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( Q \\). \n\nIn simpler terms, just because Tom did not watch football does not mean that Jen did not watch basketball. She could have watched basketball regardless of whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
