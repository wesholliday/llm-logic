            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The premises can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Let \\( V \\) represent \"the vampire was awake.\"\n2. Let \\( M \\) represent \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe first premise can be expressed as: \n- \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake).\n\nThe second premise is:\n- \\( \\neg V \\) (The vampire was not awake).\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is:\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (The mummy was not awake).\n\nNow, we can apply the rules of logic. The first premise states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, the second premise states that the vampire is not awake. \n\nIn logical terms, the argument does not follow the form of modus tollens, which would require a premise stating that if the mummy were not awake, then the vampire could not be awake. Instead, we have a situation where the vampire's state of being awake or not does not necessarily determine the mummy's state. The fact that the vampire is not awake does not provide any information about whether the mummy is awake or not. \n\nThus, the conclusion that \"the mummy was not awake\" does not logically follow from the premises provided. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
