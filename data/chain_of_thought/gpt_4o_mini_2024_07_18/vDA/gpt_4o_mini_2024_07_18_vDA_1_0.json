            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The second premise states, \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"not P.\" \n\nIn logical terms, the argument can be summarized as follows:\n1. If P (Mary was at the wedding), then Q (Sue was at the wedding).\n2. Not P (Mary was not at the wedding).\n3. Therefore, not Q (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nHowever, this reasoning is flawed. The first premise only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding; it does not provide any information about what happens if Mary is not at the wedding. It is possible for Sue to be at the wedding even if Mary is not. Therefore, the conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" does not logically follow from the premises. \n\nThus, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
