            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
