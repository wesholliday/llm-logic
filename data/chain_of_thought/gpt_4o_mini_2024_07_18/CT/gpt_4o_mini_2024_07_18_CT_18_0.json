            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
