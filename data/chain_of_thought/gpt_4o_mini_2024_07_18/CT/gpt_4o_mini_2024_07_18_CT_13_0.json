            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\" This is a valid logical inference because a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can indeed infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
