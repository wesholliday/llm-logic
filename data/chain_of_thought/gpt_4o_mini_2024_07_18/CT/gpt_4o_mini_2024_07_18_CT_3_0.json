            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James,\" we need to look at the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it translates to \"If the book is not a mystery novel (not Q), then the book was not written by James (not P).\" \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
