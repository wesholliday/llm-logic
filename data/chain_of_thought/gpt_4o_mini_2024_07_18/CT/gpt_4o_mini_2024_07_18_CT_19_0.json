            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
