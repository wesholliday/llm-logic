This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). Since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
