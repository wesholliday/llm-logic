            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding,\" we need to analyze the logical structure. The statement we have is a conditional, and its contrapositive would be \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" However, the original statement does not imply this contrapositive directly. \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude the contrapositive. The original statement only tells us what happens if Mary is present, but it does not specify what happens if Sue is absent. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary is also not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
