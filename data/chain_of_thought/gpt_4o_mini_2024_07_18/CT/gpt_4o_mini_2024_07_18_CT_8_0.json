            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be expressed in logical terms as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire is awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy is awake.\" This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" we need to look at the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), which translates to \"If the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake.\" \n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer that if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is also not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
