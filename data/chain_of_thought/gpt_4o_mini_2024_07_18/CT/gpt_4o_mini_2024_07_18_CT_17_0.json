            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad.\" This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" Since the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can indeed infer that \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
