            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
