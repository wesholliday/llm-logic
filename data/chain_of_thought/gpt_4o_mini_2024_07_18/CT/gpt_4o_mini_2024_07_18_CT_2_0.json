            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin is in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn is in the forest\". This is a conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\", we can express this as \"\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThus, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
