            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which translates to \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
