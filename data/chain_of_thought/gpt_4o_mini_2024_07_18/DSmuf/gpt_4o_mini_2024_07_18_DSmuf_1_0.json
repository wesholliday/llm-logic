            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside,\" presents a logical disjunction, which means at least one of the two statements must be true. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" negates the first part of the disjunction. If we take the first statement and the second statement together, we can conclude that since the first part (Fido must be in the garden) is false, the second part (Fido is inside) must be true in order for the disjunction to hold. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
