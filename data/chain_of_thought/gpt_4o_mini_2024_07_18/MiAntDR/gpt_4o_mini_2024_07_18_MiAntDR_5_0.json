The use of the word \"might\" suggests that both options are possibilities, but it does not confirm that either will definitely happen. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that since tomorrow is one of the options mentioned, it is indeed possible that the package might be delivered tomorrow. \n\nAnswer: yes",
