            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The document might be signed or notarized\" indicates that there are two possibilities regarding the document: it could either be signed or it could be notarized. The use of \"or\" suggests that either action is possible, but it does not rule out the possibility of one or both actions occurring. Therefore, if the document might be signed or notarized, it logically follows that it might also be notarized, since notarization is one of the options presented. \n\nAnswer: yes",
