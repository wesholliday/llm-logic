            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\" The second premise states the negation of the consequent: \"The banana was not yellow (\u00acQ).\" According to modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the consequent is false (\u00acQ), we can conclude that the antecedent must also be false (\u00acP). Therefore, from the premises given, we can validly conclude that \"The apple was not red (\u00acP).\" Since the argument follows this valid form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
