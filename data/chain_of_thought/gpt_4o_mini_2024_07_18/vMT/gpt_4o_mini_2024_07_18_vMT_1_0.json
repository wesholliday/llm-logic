            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n1. If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). \n\nThe second premise states, \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as:\n\n2. Not S (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is: \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as:\n\nC. Not M (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P). \n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n1. If M, then S (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding).\n2. Not S (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude:\n\n3. Not M (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
