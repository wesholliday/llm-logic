            "content": "Explanation: The argument follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q).\" The second premise states that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q).\" According to modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (not Q), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (not P). Therefore, from the premises given, we can validly conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P).\" Since the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
