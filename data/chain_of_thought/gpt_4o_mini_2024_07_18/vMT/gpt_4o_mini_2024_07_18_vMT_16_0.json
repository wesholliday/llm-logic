            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q).\" The second premise states that \"The pants were not denim (not Q).\" According to modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (not Q), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (not P). Therefore, from the premises given, we can validly conclude that \"The shirt was not cotton (not P).\" Since the argument follows this valid form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
