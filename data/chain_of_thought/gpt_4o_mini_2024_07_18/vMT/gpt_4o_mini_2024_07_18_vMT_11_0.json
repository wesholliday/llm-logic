            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins were blueberry (Q).\" The second premise negates the consequent: \"The muffins were not blueberry (not Q).\" According to modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). In this case, if the muffins were not blueberry, we can logically conclude that the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
