            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The first premise can be expressed as: \n\n1. If G (the griffin was in the forest), then U (the unicorn was in the forest): G \u2192 U.\n\nThe second premise states:\n\n2. Not U (the unicorn was not in the forest): \u00acU.\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is:\n\n3. Not G (the griffin was not in the forest): \u00acG.\n\nTo check for validity, we can apply the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \"G \u2192 U\" is \"\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\". This means that if the unicorn was not in the forest (\u00acU), then the griffin was also not in the forest (\u00acG). \n\nSince the second premise states that the unicorn was indeed not in the forest (\u00acU), we can conclude that the griffin was also not in the forest (\u00acG) based on the contrapositive. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
