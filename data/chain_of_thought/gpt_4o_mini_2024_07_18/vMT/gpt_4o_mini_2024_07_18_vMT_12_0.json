            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If Joe went to the park (P), then Lucy went to the zoo (Q).\" The second premise states that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo (not Q).\" According to modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (not Q), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (not P). Therefore, from the premises given, we can validly conclude that \"Joe did not go to the park (not P).\" Since the argument follows this valid logical form, it is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
