            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" The second premise negates the consequent of that conditional: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" According to modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). In this case, if Amy did not play tennis (not Q), we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (not P). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
