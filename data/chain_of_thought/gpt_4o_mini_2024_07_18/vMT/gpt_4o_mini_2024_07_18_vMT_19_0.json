            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented follows a logical structure known as modus tollens. The first premise states a conditional relationship: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" The second premise states that \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" According to the rules of modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). In this case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" Since we know that Jen did not watch basketball (not Q), we can validly conclude that Tom did not watch football (not P). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
