            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n1. \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (If V is true, then M is true)\n\nThe second premise states, \"The mummy was not awake,\" which can be represented as:\n\n2. \\( \\neg M \\) (M is false)\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is: \"The vampire was not awake,\" which can be represented as:\n\n3. \\( \\neg V \\) (V is false)\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then we can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)). \n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n- \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (The mummy was not awake)\n\nSince the mummy is not awake (\\( \\neg M \\)), we can conclude that the vampire is also not awake (\\( \\neg V \\)) using Modus Tollens. \n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
