            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. The first premise states, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented as \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) is \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) is \"Chris finished the race.\" The second premise states, \"Chris did not finish the race,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and we know that \\( C \\) is false (i.e., \\( \\neg C \\)), we can conclude that \\( A \\) must also be false (i.e., \\( \\neg A \\)). \n\nIn this case, since we have \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\), which means \"Alex did not finish the race.\" Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
