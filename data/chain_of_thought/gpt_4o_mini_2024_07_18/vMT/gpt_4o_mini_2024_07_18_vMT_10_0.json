            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning. \n\nThe first premise states: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- P \u2192 Q (where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside\").\n\nThe second premise states: \"The cat was not outside.\" This can be represented as:\n- \u00acQ (not Q).\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is: \"The dog was not inside,\" which can be represented as:\n- \u00acP (not P).\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). \n\nIn this case:\n1. We have P \u2192 Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside).\n2. We have \u00acQ (The cat was not outside).\n\nFrom these two statements, we can validly conclude \u00acP (The dog was not inside).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
