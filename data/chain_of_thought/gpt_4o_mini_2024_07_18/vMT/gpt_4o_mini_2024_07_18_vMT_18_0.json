            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The premises can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Let P represent \"the doll was plastic.\"\n2. Let Q represent \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe first premise can be expressed as: \n- If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck was metal). This is written as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe second premise states:\n- The truck was not metal, which can be expressed as \u00acQ.\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is:\n- The doll was not plastic, which can be expressed as \u00acP.\n\nNow, we can apply a logical rule known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). \n\nIn this case:\n1. We have P \u2192 Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal).\n2. We have \u00acQ (The truck was not metal).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can validly conclude \u00acP (The doll was not plastic).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
