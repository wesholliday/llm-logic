The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement) that states one of two possibilities must be true: either the remote control is under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the remote control is not under the couch, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the remote control must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
