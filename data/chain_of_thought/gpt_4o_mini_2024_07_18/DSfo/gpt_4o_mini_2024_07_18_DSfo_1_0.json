            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements to analyze:\n\n1. \"Fido is not in the garden.\"\n2. \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, which means at least one of the two options must be true. Since the first statement tells us that \"Fido is not in the garden,\" we can conclude that the first part of the disjunction is false. Therefore, for the disjunction to hold true, the second part must be true. This leads us to conclude that \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that Fido is indeed inside based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
