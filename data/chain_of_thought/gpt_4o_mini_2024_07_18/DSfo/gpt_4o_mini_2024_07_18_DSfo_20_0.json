The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement) that states one of two conditions must be true: either the sunglasses are on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the sunglasses are not on her head, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sunglasses must be in her bag. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
