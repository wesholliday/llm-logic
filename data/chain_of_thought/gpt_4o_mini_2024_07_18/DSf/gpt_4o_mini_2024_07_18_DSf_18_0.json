            "content": "Explanation: The first statement presents a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the notebook is on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. The second statement negates one of those conditions, specifically that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Since the first statement requires that one of the two conditions must be true and the second statement eliminates one of those conditions, we can conclude that the remaining condition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
