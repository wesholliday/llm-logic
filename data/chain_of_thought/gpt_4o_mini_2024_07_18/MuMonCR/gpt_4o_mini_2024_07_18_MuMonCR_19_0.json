            "content": "Explanation: The original statement specifies that \"the application must have been completed online and included references.\" This means that for the application to be valid, it must meet both conditions: it must be completed online and it must include references. If we focus on the part about references, we can see that the requirement for references is explicitly stated in the original sentence. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"the application must have included references\" as it is a necessary condition for the application to be considered complete.\n\nAnswer: yes",
