            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" indicates two conditions that must be satisfied: the project must be completed by a specific deadline (Friday) and it must also be under budget. The phrase \"and under budget\" directly implies that being under budget is a requirement for the project. Therefore, if the project is to be completed by Friday, it must also be under budget as per the original statement. Thus, we can infer that the project must have been under budget.\n\nAnswer: yes",
