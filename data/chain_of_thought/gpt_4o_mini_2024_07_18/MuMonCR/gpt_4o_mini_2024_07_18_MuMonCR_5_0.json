            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" indicates that both conditions\u2014delivery and signing\u2014are necessary for the conclusion. If the package was indeed delivered today, it follows that it must have been signed for as well, since the statement explicitly includes that requirement. Therefore, we can infer that the package must have been signed for, as it is part of the condition stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
