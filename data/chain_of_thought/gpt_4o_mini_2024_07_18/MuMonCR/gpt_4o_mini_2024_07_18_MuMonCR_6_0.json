            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" explicitly states that the concert started at 8 PM. Therefore, we can directly infer that the concert must have started at that time. The phrase \"must have been sold out\" does not affect the inference regarding the start time of the concert. Since the start time is clearly mentioned, we can conclude that it is indeed true that the concert started at 8 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
