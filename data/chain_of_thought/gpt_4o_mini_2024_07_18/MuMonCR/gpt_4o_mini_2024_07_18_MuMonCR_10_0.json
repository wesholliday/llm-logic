            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" indicates that both actions\u2014signing and notarizing\u2014are required for the document. If the document has been signed and notarized, it logically follows that it must have been notarized as one of the conditions. Therefore, we can infer that if the document is indeed signed and notarized, it must have been notarized. However, the original statement does not provide information about the document being notarized independently of it being signed. Thus, we cannot definitively conclude that the document must have been notarized without knowing if it was signed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
