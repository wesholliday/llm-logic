            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements logically. \n\n1. The first statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" can be interpreted as saying that it is not necessary for the book to be on the table. This implies that the book could be somewhere else, but it does not definitively state where the book is.\n\n2. The second statement, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" presents a disjunction. This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the book is on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements:\n- From the first statement, we know that the book does not have to be on the table.\n- The second statement tells us that one of the two conditions must hold true.\n\nSince the first statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the book must be on the shelf. \n\nThus, we can conclude that if the book is not on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
