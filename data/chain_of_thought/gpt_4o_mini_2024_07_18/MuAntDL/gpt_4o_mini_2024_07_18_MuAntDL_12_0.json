            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities: either the project is completed by Friday, or it is extended. The use of \"or\" indicates that at least one of these conditions must be true. However, it does not guarantee that the project has indeed been completed by Friday; it only states that if it is not completed by that time, then it must be extended. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the project must have been completed by Friday based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
