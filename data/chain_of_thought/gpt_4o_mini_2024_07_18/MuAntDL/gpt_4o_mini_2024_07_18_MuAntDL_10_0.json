            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" indicates that at least one of the two conditions (being signed or being notarized) must be true for the document to be valid. If we focus on the phrase \"or notarized,\" it suggests that the document could be valid if it is either signed or notarized. Therefore, if the document is notarized, it does not necessarily have to be signed for it to meet the requirement. However, if we are only considering the requirement of being signed, we cannot definitively conclude that the document must have been signed, as notarization alone could suffice. Thus, we cannot infer that the document must have been signed based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
