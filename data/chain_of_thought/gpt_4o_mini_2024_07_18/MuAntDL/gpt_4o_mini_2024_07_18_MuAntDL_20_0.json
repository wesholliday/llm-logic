This means that while it is possible for the event to be formal, it is not a certainty. The presence of \"or\" suggests that the event could also be semi-formal, which does not meet the criteria of being strictly formal. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the event must have been formal based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
