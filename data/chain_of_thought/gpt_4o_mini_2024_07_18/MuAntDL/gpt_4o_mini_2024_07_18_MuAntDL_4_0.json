            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting occurred at 2 PM or it was cancelled. However, it does not assert that one of these conditions must be true; it only states that at least one of them is true. Therefore, it is possible that the meeting was cancelled, which would mean that the meeting did not occur at 2 PM. Since we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting took place at 2 PM based solely on the information given, we cannot infer that the meeting must have been at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: no",
