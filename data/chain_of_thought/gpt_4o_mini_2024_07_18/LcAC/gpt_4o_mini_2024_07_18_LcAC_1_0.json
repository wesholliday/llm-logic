            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" confirms Q. However, the truth of Q does not provide any information about the truth of P. In logical terms, just because Q is true does not mean that P must also be true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
