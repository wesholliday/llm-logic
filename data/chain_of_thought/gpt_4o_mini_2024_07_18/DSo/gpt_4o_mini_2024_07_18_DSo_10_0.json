The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the sock is in the laundry basket or it is under the bed.\n\nSince we have established from the first statement that the sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sock must be in the laundry basket. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
