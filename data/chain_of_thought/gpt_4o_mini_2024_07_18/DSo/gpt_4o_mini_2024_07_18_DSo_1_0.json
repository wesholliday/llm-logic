Since we know from the first statement that \"Fido is not in the garden,\" we can eliminate the possibility of Fido being in the garden. Therefore, the only remaining option from the disjunction is that \"Fido is inside.\" \n\nThus, we can conclude that Fido must be inside based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
