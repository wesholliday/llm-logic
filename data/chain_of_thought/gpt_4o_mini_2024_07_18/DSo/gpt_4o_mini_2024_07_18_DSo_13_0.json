Since we know from the first statement that \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" is true, we can eliminate that option from the disjunction. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The toy is in the toy box\" must be true.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the toy must indeed be in the toy box based on the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
