The second statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\" This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two options must be true. Since we already know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that \"the pen is in my bag.\" Therefore, we can logically conclude that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
