The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\nSince we have established that the milk is not chilling in the fridge (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the milk must be on the counter. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
