The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\n\nSince we have established from the first statement that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the cookies must be in the jar. Therefore, we can conclude that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
