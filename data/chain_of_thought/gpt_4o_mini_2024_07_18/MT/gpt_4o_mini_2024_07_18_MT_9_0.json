            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q), we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
