            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement \"Jen did not watch basketball\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). This is known as the contrapositive rule in logic. Therefore, since we know that Jen did not watch basketball (not Q), we can infer that Tom did not watch football (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
