            "content": "Explanation: The statements provided can be analyzed using logical reasoning. The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"V \u2192 M,\" where V represents \"the vampire is awake\" and M represents \"the mummy is awake.\" The second statement, \"The mummy was not awake,\" can be expressed as \"\u00acM.\" \n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically Modus Tollens, we can derive conclusions from these statements. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" (if P then Q) and \"\u00acQ\" (not Q), we can conclude \"\u00acP\" (not P). \n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. V \u2192 M (If the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake)\n2. \u00acM (The mummy is not awake)\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\nSince the mummy is not awake (\u00acM), we can conclude that the vampire is also not awake (\u00acV).\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
