            "content": "Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel). The second statement tells us that the book is not a mystery novel, which can be represented as \u00acQ (not Q). \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), we can conclude that P must also be false (\u00acP). This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since we know the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acQ), we can infer that the book was not written by James (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
