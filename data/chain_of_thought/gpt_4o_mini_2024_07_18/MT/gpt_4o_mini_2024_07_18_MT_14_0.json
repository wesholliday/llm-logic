            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the bear is in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf is in the den.\" The second statement, \"The wolf was not in the den,\" can be expressed as \"not B.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false (not B), we can conclude that A must also be false (not A). This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since we know that the wolf was not in the den (not B), we can infer that the bear was not in the cave (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
