            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be understood as a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The second statement, \"Erin did not take a train,\" can be represented as \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have a conditional statement and the consequent (Q) is false (not Q), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (not P). This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since Erin did not take a train, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
