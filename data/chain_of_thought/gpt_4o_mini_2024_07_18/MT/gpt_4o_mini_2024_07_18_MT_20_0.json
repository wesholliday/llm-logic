            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement \"The banana was not yellow\" can be represented as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (in this case, the banana is not yellow), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we know that the banana was not yellow (not Q), we can infer that the apple was not red (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
