            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad.\" The second statement, \"Kate did not eat the salad,\" can be represented as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement and the consequent (Q) is false (in this case, Kate did not eat the salad), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since Q is false, we can infer that P is also false, which means \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
