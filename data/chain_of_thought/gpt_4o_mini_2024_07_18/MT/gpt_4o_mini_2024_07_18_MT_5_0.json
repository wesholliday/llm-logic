            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The second statement \"Amy did not play tennis\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we know that Amy did not play tennis, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
