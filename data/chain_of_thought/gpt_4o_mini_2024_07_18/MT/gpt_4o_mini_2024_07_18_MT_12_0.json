            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" can be represented as \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have a conditional statement and the consequent (Q) is false (not Q), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (not P). This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
