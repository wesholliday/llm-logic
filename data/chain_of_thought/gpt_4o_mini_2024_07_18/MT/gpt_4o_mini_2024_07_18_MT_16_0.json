            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be understood as a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The second statement \"The pants were not denim\" can be represented as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (in this case, the pants are not denim), we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, since we know that the pants were not denim (not Q), we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
