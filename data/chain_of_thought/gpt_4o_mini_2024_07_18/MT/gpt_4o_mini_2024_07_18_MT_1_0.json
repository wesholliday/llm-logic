            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be expressed in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The second statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" can be expressed as \"not Q.\" \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can conclude that P must also be false (not P). This is known as the contrapositive rule. Therefore, since we know that Sue was not at the wedding (not Q), we can infer that Mary was also not at the wedding (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
