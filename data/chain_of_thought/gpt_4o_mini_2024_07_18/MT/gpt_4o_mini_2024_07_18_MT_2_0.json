            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in logical terms as: if G (the griffin is in the forest) then U (the unicorn is in the forest). The second statement, \"The unicorn was not in the forest,\" can be expressed as \u00acU (not U). \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (if G then U) and we know that the conclusion (U) is false (\u00acU), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens.\" This rule states that if the implication is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. \n\nApplying this to our statements:\n1. If G then U (if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest).\n2. \u00acU (the unicorn is not in the forest).\n\nFrom these, we can conclude \u00acG (the griffin is not in the forest). Therefore, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
