            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"Either Fido is inside (P) or Fido must be in the garden (Q).\" This can be expressed as: P \u2228 Q.\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be expressed as: \u00acQ.\n3. The conclusion states: \"Fido is inside.\" This can be expressed as: P.\n\nNow, we can apply the rules of logic. The first premise (P \u2228 Q) indicates that at least one of the statements P or Q must be true. The second premise (\u00acQ) tells us that Q is false. \n\nUsing the disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acQ, we can conclude P. In this case, since Q is false, the only option left for the first premise to hold true is for P to be true. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
