            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The first premise can be expressed as \\( P \\lor Q \\) (where \\( P \\) is \"the pen is in my bag\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pen is on my desk\"). The second premise states \\( \\neg Q \\) (it is not the case that the pen is on my desk). \n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, we can derive the conclusion. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( P \\). In this case, since we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (the pen is in my bag or on my desk) and \\( \\neg Q \\) (the pen is not on my desk), we can validly conclude \\( P \\) (the pen is in my bag).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
