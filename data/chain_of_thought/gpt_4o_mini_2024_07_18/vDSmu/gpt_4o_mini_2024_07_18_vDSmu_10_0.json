            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze its structure using propositional logic. The first premise can be expressed as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the missing sock is in the laundry basket\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the missing sock is under the bed.\" The second premise states \\( \\neg Q \\), meaning \"it is not the case that the missing sock is under the bed.\" \n\nFrom these two premises, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( P \\). In this case, since we have established that the missing sock cannot be under the bed (\\( \\neg Q \\)), we can conclude that it must be in the laundry basket (\\( P \\)). \n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
