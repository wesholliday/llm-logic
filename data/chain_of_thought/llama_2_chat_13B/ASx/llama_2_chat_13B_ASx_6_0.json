The word \"snarfs\" is a plural noun, indicating that there are multiple snarfs that could potentially be harmed by glurping.\n3. The sentence does not specify what type of clothing or protection the speaker is wearing to protect their snarfs from glurping.\n4. Based on the information provided, it is possible that the speaker is wearing plorks (a hypothetical type of clothing) to protect their snarfs from glurping.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that if the speaker is wearing plorks and you glurp, it will still hurt their snarfs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
