The sentence \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled\" implies that there is a direct causal relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled.\n2. The sentence \"If the plink light is out\" does not directly affect the goom's snurpling status.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\n\nAnswer: no",
