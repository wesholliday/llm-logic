Here we go!\n\nSo, the given statement is \"If the quop is in the blarf, then it becomes gloobed.\" Let me break this down:\n\n1. The quop is in the blarf.\n2. If the quop is in the blarf, then it becomes gloobed.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement: \"If the quop is in the blarf and the blarf is twinkling, then it becomes gloobed.\"\n\n1. The quop is in the blarf (this is already given).\n2. The blarf is twinkling.\n3. If the quop is in the blarf and the blarf is twinkling, then it becomes gloobed.\n\nHmmm... I can see that the new statement is logically implied by the original statement. The fact that the blarf is twinkling doesn't change the fact that the quop becomes gloobed if it's in the blarf. So, I think I can infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
