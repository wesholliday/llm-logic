This means that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper: the porch or the driveway.\n\nWe also know that the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch, because we were told that \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\" This means that the newspaper must be in one of the other possible locations, which is the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
