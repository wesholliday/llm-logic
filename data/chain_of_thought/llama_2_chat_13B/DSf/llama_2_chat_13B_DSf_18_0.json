This means that one of two possibilities is true:\n\n1. The notebook is sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nWe also know that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, because we were told that \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that possibility 1 is not true, and therefore possibility 2 must be true:\n\n2. The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
