Therefore, Alex finished the race (conclusion)\n\nMy reasoning is based on the fact that if Alex finished the race, then it's logically certain that Chris also finished the race, since the premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. So, we can infer that Alex finished the race based on the given information that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
