The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) will also be true.\n3. So, if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy would have played tennis.\n4. We know that Amy did play tennis, so we can infer that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
