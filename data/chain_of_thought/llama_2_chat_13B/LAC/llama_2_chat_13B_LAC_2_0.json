We also know that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n3. Therefore, we can logically infer that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is true for all instances where the unicorn is in the forest.\n4. Since we know that the unicorn is in the forest, we can substitute this into the first statement:\n\n\"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\nSubstituting \"the unicorn was in the forest\" for \"the unicorn\":\n\n\"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\nSince this statement is true, we can logically infer that:\n\n\"The griffin was in the forest\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
