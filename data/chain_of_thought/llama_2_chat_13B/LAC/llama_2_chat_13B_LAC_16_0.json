The sentence \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the 'if') is true, then the consequent (the part after the 'if') must also be true.\n3. In this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\", and the consequent is \"the pants were denim\".\n4. Since we know that the pants were denim, we can infer that the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
