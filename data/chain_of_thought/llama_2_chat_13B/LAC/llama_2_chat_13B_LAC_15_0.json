We know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. We also know that \"Erin took a train.\" This is a fact that we are given.\n3. Based on the first premise, if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. Since we know that Erin did take a train, it follows that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
