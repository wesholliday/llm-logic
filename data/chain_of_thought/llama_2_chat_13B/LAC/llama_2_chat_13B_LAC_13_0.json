We also know that \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nSo, can we logically infer that the car was red? Let's analyze the information we have:\n\n3. If the car was red, then the truck would be blue.\n4. The truck is blue.\n\nBased on these two statements, it seems that the only possible conclusion we can draw is that the car was red. This is because if the car had been any other color, the truck would not have been blue. Therefore, the only logical inference we can make from the given information is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
