    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup, according to betting odds.\n2. If Brazil doesn't win, then England will win.\n3. It is likely that Spain will win, and therefore it is likely that Brazil won't win.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these statements:\n\n1. If Spain wins, then Brazil won't win (because if Brazil won, it would be more likely than Spain winning).\n2. If Spain doesn't win, then England will win (according to statement 3).\n3. It is likely that Spain will win, so it is likely that Brazil won't win.\n\nNow, let me think about the conclusion we can draw from these statements:\n\nIf Spain doesn't win, then it is likely that England will win.\n\nYes, that's correct! Based on the given information, if Spain doesn't win, it is likely that England will win.",
