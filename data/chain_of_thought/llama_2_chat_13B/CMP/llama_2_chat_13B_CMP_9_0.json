    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

Apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits.\n2. According to grocery store data, it's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas.\n3. Oranges will trail distantly behind.\n4. If bananas aren't the top seller, then oranges will be.\n5. It's likely that apples will be the top seller, so if bananas aren't, oranges won't be.\n\nNow, let me think about this for a moment...\n\nHmmm... based on the information given, it seems that the most likely scenario is that apples will be the top-selling fruit, followed by bananas, and then oranges. However, if bananas aren't the top seller, then oranges will be. But if apples aren't the top seller, then oranges still won't be the top seller because bananas will be.\n\nSo, to answer the question, it is not likely that oranges will be the top-selling fruit if apples aren't the top seller. The most likely outcome is that apples will be the top seller, followed by bananas, and then oranges.\n\nTherefore, my answer is... no!",
