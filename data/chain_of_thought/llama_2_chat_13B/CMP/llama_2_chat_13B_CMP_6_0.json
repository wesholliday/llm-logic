    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

Industry experts project that Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies this year, followed closely by Bad Bunny's album.\n2. If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then Beyonce's album will be the third best-selling album of the year.\n3. However, Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies, so it's unlikely that Bad Bunny's album will sell more than Taylor Swift's.\n4. Therefore, if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, it's likely that Beyonce's album will be the third best-selling album of the year.\n\nNow, I'm ready to answer:\n\nAnswer: No",
