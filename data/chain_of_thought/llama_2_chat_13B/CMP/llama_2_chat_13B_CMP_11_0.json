    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales.\n2. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota.\n3. Honda is lagging significantly behind.\n4. If Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then Honda will be.\n5. Ford likely will lead in sales, so Toyota likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's think about the question: Does it follow that if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?\n\nHmm...let me think. If Ford doesn't lead in sales, then Toyota might lead instead, right? But wait, we were told that if Toyota isn't #1 in sales, then Honda will be. So, if Ford doesn't lead in sales and Toyota doesn't either, then Honda must be the leader!\n\nOkay, I think I have it! Here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: No.",
