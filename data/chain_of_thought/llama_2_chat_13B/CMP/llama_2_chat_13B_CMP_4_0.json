    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

If Julian doesn't get the offer, then Diego is a longshot, so it's unlikely that Diego will get the offer if Julian doesn't.\n3. It's likely that Priya will get the offer, so it's unlikely that Priya won't get the offer.\n4. If Priya doesn't get the offer, then it's likely that Julian won't get the offer either, since Julian is the next most likely candidate.\n5. Therefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, it's unlikely that Diego will get the offer.\n\nAnswer: No",
