    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

Financial advisors expect the stock market to see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns.\n2. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then bonds will.\n3. Stocks are likely to have the highest returns, so real estate is unlikely to have the highest returns.\n4. Therefore, if stocks don't have the highest returns, it is likely that bonds will.\n\nNow, I am ready to answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
