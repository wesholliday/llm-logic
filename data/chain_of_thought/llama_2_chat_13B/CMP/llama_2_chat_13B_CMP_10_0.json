    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

Forecasts show that most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer.\n3. If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will.\n4. Spring likely will have the most travelers, so summer likely won't.\n\nNow, based on my reasoning, I will answer the question:\n\nAnswer: No.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: even if spring doesn't have the most vacations, it is still likely to have more vacations than winter. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.",
