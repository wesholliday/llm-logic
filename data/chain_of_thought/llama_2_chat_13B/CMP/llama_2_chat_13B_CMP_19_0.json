    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

Here we go!\n\nSo, let me see... if rents are expected to increase the most, then home prices are likely to increase less than rents, right? And if home prices don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most, correct?\n\nBut wait, there's a catch! If rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates won't increase the most either, because home prices won't be increasing as much as rents. Got it?\n\nSo, to summarize: if rents don't increase the most, then home prices won't increase the most, and therefore mortgage rates won't increase the most either.\n\nNow, let me think about this for a moment... hmmm... I believe that's correct!\n\nAnswer: no",
