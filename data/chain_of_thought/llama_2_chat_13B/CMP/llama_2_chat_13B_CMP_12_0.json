Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

Thrillers are the top-selling genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind.\n2. If thrillers aren't #1, then romances won't be either.\n3. Thrillers will likely lead sales, so romances won't be #1.\n\nNow, let's think about the question: Does it follow that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be?\n\nHmm...let me think. If thrillers are the top-selling genre and they likely will lead sales, then it's less likely that mysteries will be #1. But, if thrillers aren't #1, then romances won't be either, right? So, in that case, it's possible that mysteries could be #1.\n\nWait a minute...I think I see where this is going. If thrillers aren't #1, then the second-place genre (romances) won't be #1 either. And if neither of those two genres are #1, then the third-place genre (mysteries) could potentially move up to #1!\n\nYes, I think that's correct! If thrillers aren't #1, it's likely that mysteries will be #1.\n\nSo, the answer is...yes!",
