The statement \"The twonk might not have been varnished\" implies that there is a possibility that the twonk was not varnished.\n2. If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished (this is the given information).\n3. Therefore, if the twonk was not plinked, then it cannot be varnished (logical deduction based on the previous two statements).\n4. So, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
