The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (i.e., the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the conclusion (i.e., the zinger must have been smoogled) also must be true.\n2. The statement \"The zinger might not have been smoogled\" implies that there is a possibility that the zinger was not smoogled, even if it was fraggled.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it must not have been smoogled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
