This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it is certain that the wug was garpled.\n\nSo, if we assume that the wug was sproinged, we can conclude that the wug was definitely garpled. But we are trying to infer whether the wug was not sproinged.\n\nTherefore, if we start with the assumption that the wug was not sproinged, we can deduce that the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
