The statement \"The flugel might not have been zargled\" implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled, but it does not confirm whether it was or wasn't.\n2. The second statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
