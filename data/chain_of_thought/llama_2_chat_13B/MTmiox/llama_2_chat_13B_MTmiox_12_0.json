The statement \"The smip might not have lupped the zoint\" implies that there is a possibility that the smip did not lick the zoint.\n2. If the smip was shripped, then it would have been unable to lick the zoint, and therefore it is certain that the smip did not lick the zoint.\n3. Therefore, if the statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\" is true, then we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
