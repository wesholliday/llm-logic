The sentence \"The dreb might not have been spened\" implies that the dreb is not guaranteed to have been spened, but it could have been.\n2. The sentence \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\" is a conditional statement that implies if the dreb was vroomed, then it must have been spened.\n3. Based on these two sentences, we can infer that if the dreb was not vroomed, then it was not spened.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' from the given statements?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
