The statement \"The fleeg might not have been surned\" implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not bluttered.\n2. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned, because the two statements are logically equivalent (i.e., if the fleeg is bluttered, then it must have been surned).\n3. Therefore, if we assume that the fleeg was not surned, we can conclude that it was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
