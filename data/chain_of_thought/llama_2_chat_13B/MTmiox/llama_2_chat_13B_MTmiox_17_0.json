From this statement, we can infer that the flob did not movate (logical negation).\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\"\n4. If we assume that the flob was skizzled, then we can infer that the flob did movate (based on the second statement).\n5. However, since we already know that the flob did not movate (from step 2), we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
