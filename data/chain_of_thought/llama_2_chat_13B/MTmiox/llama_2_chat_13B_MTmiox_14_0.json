The sentence \"The clug might not have been snugged\" implies that the clug was not necessarily snugged, but it is possible that it was.\n2. The sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\" implies that if the clug was fleeked (i.e., if it had a certain quality or characteristic), then it must have been snugged (i.e., it must have had a certain other quality or characteristic).\n3. Based on these two sentences, we can infer that if the clug was not fleeked, then it was not snugged.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The clug was not fleeked\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
