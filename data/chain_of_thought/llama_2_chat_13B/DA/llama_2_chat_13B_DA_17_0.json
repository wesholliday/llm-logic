If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate must have eaten the pasta because the sentence states that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n3. Therefore, if Ben did not eat pasta, it means that Kate ate the pasta instead.\n4. Since Kate ate the pasta, she did not eat the salad because there is no mention of her eating the salad in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
