The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'if') is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\".\n3. Since the shirt was not cotton, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false. This means that the conclusion of the conditional statement (i.e., \"the pants were denim\") cannot be inferred.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
