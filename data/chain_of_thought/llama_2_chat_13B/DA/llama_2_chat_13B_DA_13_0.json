We know that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car had been red, then the truck would have been blue.\n2. We also know that \"The car was not red.\" This means that the car did not have the property of being red.\n3. So, based on the first premise, we can infer that the truck did not have the property of being blue, because if the car had been red, then the truck would have been blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
