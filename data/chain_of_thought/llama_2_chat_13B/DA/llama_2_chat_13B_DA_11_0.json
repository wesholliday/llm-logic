We know that the cake was not chocolate, so we can conclude that the muffins were not chocolate either (based on the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\").\n2. However, this does not necessarily mean that the muffins were blueberry. There could be other types of muffins that are not blueberry.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry based solely on the fact that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
