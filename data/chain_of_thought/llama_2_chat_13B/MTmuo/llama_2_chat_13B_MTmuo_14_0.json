We know that \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that it is possible for the wolf to be in the den, but we are told that it is not the case.\n2. We also know that \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that if the bear was in the cave, then it would be necessary for the wolf to be in the den.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf must not have been in the den.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
