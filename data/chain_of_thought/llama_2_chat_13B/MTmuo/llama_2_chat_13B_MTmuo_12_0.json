From this, we can infer that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n4. If we assume that Joe went to the park, then we know that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (based on the second statement).\n5. However, since we already know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (from the first statement), this means that our assumption about Joe going to the park must be false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
