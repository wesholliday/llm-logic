The statement \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" means that it is possible for Erin to have taken a different mode of transportation, such as a car or a bus.\n3. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (based on the first statement).\n4. Therefore, if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin must have taken a different mode of transportation (such as a car or a bus).\n\nNow, based on my reasoning, I can answer the question:\n\nAnswer: yes",
