This means that there is a possibility that the truck could have been plastic or made of some other material.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" If we assume that the doll was plastic, then this premise would imply that the truck must have been metal. However, since we know that the truck was not necessarily metal, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
