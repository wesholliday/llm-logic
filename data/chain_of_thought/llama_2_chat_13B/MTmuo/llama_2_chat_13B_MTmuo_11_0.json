If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate. Here's why:\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry (based on statement 2).\nBut we know that the muffins were not blueberry (based on statement 1).\nTherefore, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
