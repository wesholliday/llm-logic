We know that \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" (this is given in the premise).\n2. From this premise, we can infer that there is no possibility that Amy played tennis.\n3. Now, let's consider the second premise: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\".\n4. If Jeff played basketball, then according to the second premise, Amy would have played tennis.\n5. But we just inferred that there is no possibility that Amy played tennis (step 2).\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
