We know that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, it would be true that Kate must have eaten salad.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\" is given. This means that it is not true that Kate must have eaten salad.\n3. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, it would be true that Kate must have eaten salad, but since it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad, it follows that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
