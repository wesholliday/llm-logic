            "content": "Okay! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. We know that \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is true, because if it were the case, then we would have to conclude that the unicorn was in the forest, which is false.\n2. We also know that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a logical implication of the first statement. This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then we would have to conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n3. Therefore, if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, then we can also infer that the unicorn must not have been in the forest.\n\nSo, based on these steps, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
