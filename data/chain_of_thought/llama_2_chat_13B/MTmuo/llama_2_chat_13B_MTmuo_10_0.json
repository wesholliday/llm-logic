The statement \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside\" means that it is possible for the cat to be inside.\n3. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (this follows logically from the premises).\n4. Therefore, if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nNow, based on these steps, can we infer that the dog was not inside?\n\nAnswer: yes",
