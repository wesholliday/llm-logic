            "content": "Okay! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. We know that \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that there is no logical necessity for Sue to have been at the wedding, even if Mary was there.\n2. We also know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue would have had to be there as well.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue could also not have been there. In other words, if Mary's presence is not required for Sue to have been at the wedding, then Sue must not have been at the wedding either.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
