The statement \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n3. Therefore, it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n4. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (from premise 1), but we just established that this is not the case (from premise 2 and conclusion 3).\n5. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
