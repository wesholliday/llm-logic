This means that if the newspaper is not in the driveway, then it must be on the porch.\n\nNow, we are also given that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. This means that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not on the porch, even if it is not in the driveway.\n\nSo, if the newspaper is not in the driveway and it is not on the porch, then where is it? We have already established that it cannot be in the driveway or on the porch, so the only other option is that it must be inside the house.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the newspaper is inside the house.\n\nAnswer: yes",
