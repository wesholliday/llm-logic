            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" implies that the jacket cannot be in both places at once.\n2. The statement \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that the jacket could be in a different location, such as on the chair.\n3.
