The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car. Here's why:\n\n3. If the umbrella were tucked away in the closet, it would be included in the phrase \"the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\" However, since it is not included, we can infer that it is not tucked away in the closet, and therefore must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
