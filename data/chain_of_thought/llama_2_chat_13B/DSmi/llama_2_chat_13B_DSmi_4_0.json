This means that one of the two statements must be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but it does not necessarily mean that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then we can logically conclude that the cat must be napping on the couch. This is because there is no other option left, given that the cat cannot be both napping on the couch and playing in the bedroom at the same time.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
