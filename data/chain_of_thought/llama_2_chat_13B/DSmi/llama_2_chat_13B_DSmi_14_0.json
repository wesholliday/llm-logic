Well, let me think...\n\nIf the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter, right? But wait, we can't assume that just because the milk might not be in the fridge, it must be on the counter. There could be other places where the milk could be, like a different room or a different location altogether.\n\nHmmm... I'm having a hard time inferring that the milk is on the counter based on these two statements alone. It seems like there are too many possibilities and we don't have enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
