The sentence \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" implies that the pen cannot be in both places at once.\n2. The sentence \"The pen might not be on my desk\" suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk, but does not necessarily mean that it is in my bag.\n3. Therefore, based on these two sentences, we can infer that the pen is either in my bag or not on my desk.\n4. Since we know that the pen might not be on my desk, and it cannot be in both places at once, it must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
