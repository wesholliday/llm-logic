The statement \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\" implies that the phone cannot be in both places at once.\n2. We are also given that \"The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the phone could be in the living room, but it might not be ringing.\n3.
