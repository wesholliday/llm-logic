This means that one of the two statements must be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" gives us additional information that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, but it does not provide any information about whether they are in the jar or not.\n\nSo, let's assume that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. This means that they must be either in the jar or somewhere else. Since we know that they cannot be both in the jar and hidden in the pantry, this means that they must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
