The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" implies that the shoes cannot be both in the closet and lined up by the door at the same time.\n2. The statement \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\" means that it is possible that the shoes are not lined up by the door, even if they are in the closet.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
