The missing sock might not be under the bed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. This is because if the missing sock were under the bed, it would not be \"might not be\" there, it would definitely be there. Therefore, the only possible location for the missing sock is the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
