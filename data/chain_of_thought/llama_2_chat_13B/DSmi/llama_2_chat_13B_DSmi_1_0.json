There is no other option.\n\nThe second sentence is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but we don't know for sure.\n\nNow, let me think about what we can infer from these two sentences. If Fido must be in the garden, then he cannot be inside the house. But if Fido might not be in the garden, then it is possible that he could be inside the house.\n\nSo, based on these two sentences, we can infer that Fido is inside the house. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
