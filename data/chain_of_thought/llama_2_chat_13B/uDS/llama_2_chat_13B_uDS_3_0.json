This means that one of two possibilities is true: either the keys are in the drawer, or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nSecond, we know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet. This means that the second possibility - that the keys are dangling in the cabinet - is not true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, it seems likely that the keys are in the drawer. In fact, it's the only possibility that remains after ruling out the other option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
