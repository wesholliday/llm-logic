If the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, then we wouldn't be able to infer that it is in the box because it would be difficult to distinguish it from the other pieces on the floor.\n\nHowever, since the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, we can infer that it must be in the box! This is because if it were on the floor, we would have seen it and it wouldn't be \"missing\" anymore. Therefore, the only place the missing puzzle piece could be is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
