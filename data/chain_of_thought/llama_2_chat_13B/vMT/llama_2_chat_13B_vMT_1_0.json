            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that Sue did not attend the wedding.\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding (for the sake of argument), then we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding, based on the first premise.\n\nHowever, if we combine the two premises, we get a logical contradiction. If Mary was at the wedding and Sue was not at the wedding, then the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" must be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid, because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: no",
