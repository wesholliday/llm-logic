This means that if the alien went to Mars, it must have also gone to Jupiter.\n2. The second premise states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the robot did not go to Jupiter.\n3. If the alien visited Mars and the robot did not visit Jupiter, then it follows that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
