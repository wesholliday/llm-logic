This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nThe second premise states that Erin did not take a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would not have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
