This means that if the dog was inside the house, then the cat must have been outside the house.\n2. The second premise states that the cat was not outside. This means that the cat was not outside the house.\n3. Based on the first and second premises, we can conclude that the dog was not inside the house. This is because if the dog was inside, then the cat would have been outside, but since the cat was not outside, it follows that the dog was not inside.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
