This implies that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
