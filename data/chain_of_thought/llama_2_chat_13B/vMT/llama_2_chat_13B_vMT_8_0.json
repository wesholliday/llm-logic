            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was not asleep, then the mummy must have been awake as well.\n2. The second premise states that the mummy was not awake. This means that the mummy was either asleep or dead.\n3. If the mummy was asleep, then it would be impossible for the vampire to be awake, since the first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n4. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the vampire was not awake, since the mummy was not awake and could not have been awake if the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
