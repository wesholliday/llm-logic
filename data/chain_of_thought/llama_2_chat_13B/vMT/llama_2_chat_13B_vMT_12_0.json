This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Joe went to the park (the antecedent of the argument), we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo (the consequent of the argument).\n\nSo, the conclusion of the argument is 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
