This means that if Alex completed the race, then Chris must have also completed the race.\n\nThe second premise states that Chris did not finish the race. This means that Chris did not complete the race.\n\nSo, if we assume that Alex finished the race (which is the antecedent of the first premise), then we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race (which is the consequent of the first premise).\n\nHowever, since Chris did not finish the race, it follows that Alex did not finish the race. This is because if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex cannot have finished the race either (by the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is true, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
