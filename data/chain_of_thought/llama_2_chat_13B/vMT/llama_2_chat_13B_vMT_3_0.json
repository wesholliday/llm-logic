This means that if the book was written by James, it must have certain characteristics that are typical of mystery novels.\n2. The second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the book does not have those characteristic features that are typical of mystery novels.\n3. If the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot be true that it was written by James. This is because James only writes mystery novels, so if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
