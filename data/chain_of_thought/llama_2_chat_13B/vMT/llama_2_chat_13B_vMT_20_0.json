This means that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana would have the property of being yellow.\n2. The second premise states that the banana was not yellow. This means that the banana does not have the property of being yellow.\n3. Based on the first and second premises, we can conclude that the apple was not red. This is because if the apple had been red, then the banana would have been yellow, but since the banana is not yellow, it follows that the apple is not red.\n\nNow, let me answer the question:\n\nAnswer: yes",
