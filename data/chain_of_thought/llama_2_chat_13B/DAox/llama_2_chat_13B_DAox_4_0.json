From this statement, we can infer that the fribble did not undergo the process of snurgling (logical consequence).\n3. If the fribble had been snurgled, then it would have crinked (given statement).\n4. Therefore, since the fribble was not snurgled, we can infer that it did not crink (logical consequence).\n\nAnswer: yes",
