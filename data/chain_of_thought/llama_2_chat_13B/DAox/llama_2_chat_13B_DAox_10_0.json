From this statement, we can infer that the wug was not subjected to the action of sproinging, whatever that might be.\n3. The second statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n4. This statement implies that if the wug had been sproinged, then it would have been subjected to the action of garpling.\n5. Based on the first statement, we know that the wug was not sproinged, so it did not receive the action of garpling.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
