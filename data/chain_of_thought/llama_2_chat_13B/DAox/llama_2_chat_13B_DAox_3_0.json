If the splat was not morphed, then it did not change its shape or form in any way.\n2. If the splat did not change its shape or form, then it cannot have quanked, because quanking implies a change in shape or form (i.e., the splat would have to have been squished or flattened).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank, since it did not change its shape or form and therefore could not have been squished or flattened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
