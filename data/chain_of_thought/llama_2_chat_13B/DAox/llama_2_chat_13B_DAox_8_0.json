            "content": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The sprocket was not cranked\" implies that the sprocket was in a certain position, which we'll call Position A.\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then it would be in a different position, which we'll call Position B.\n3. The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies that if the sprocket was in Position B, then it was also in a state of being daggled.\n4. Therefore, if the sprocket was not cranked (i.e., it was in Position A), then it cannot be daggled, because daggling only occurs when the sprocket is in Position B.\n\nSo, based on these statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
