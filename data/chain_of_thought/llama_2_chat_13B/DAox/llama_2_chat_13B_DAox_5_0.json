The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" implies that if the zinger was broken or damaged, then it must have been smoogled (which means to cover something with a thick layer of fog).\n3. Therefore, if the zinger was not fraggled, then it cannot be smoogled, because there is no need to cover it with fog if it is not broken or damaged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
