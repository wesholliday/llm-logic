If it was plinked, then according to statement 2, it must have been varnished. So, in this case, the answer would be \"Answer: yes, the twonk was varnished.\"\n\nHowever, we know that the twonk was not plinked (statement 1), so we can't assume that it was plinked. Therefore, we can't infer that the twonk was varnished based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no, the twonk was not varnished.",
