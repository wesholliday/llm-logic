We know that \"the whiffle was not shanked.\" This means that the whiffle did not undergo a certain action (shanking).\n2. We also know that \"if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This means that if the whiffle had been shanked, then it would have made a sound (tinked).\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that the whiffle did not make any sound (tink) because it was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
