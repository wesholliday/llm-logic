The sentence \"The grommet did not sploff\" implies that the grommet did not make a splashing sound, which means it did not enter the water.\n2. If the grommet had entered the water, it would have made a splashing sound and we would know that it had sploffed.\n3. Therefore, if the grommet did not sploff, then it must not have plopped the frink (since plopping the frink requires entering the water).\n\nAnswer: yes",
