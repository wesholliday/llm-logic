It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. (This is the negation of the second statement.)\n3. Therefore, it is not the case that the zinger was fraggled. (This follows logically from the first two statements.)\n\nSo, based on these three statements, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
