It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled. Here's why:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then it would have plagged (based on the first statement).\n2. However, we know that the smonk did not plag (based on the second statement).\n3. Therefore, the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
