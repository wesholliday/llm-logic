It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed. Here's why:\n\n1. If the grommet was sploffed, then it would have plopped the frink (based on statement 1).\n2. However, since it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink (based on statement 2), we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
