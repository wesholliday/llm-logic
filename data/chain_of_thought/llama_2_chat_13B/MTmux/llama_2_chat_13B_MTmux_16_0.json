If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n2. It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nOkay, let's analyze these premises carefully.\n\nPremise 1 says that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. This means that if the sneg was in a state of being crampled, then it must have had the ability to sprot the frink.\n\nPremise 2 says that it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that even if the sneg was crampled, it did not have the ability to sprot the frink.\n\nNow, let's think about what these two premises together might imply. If the sneg was crampled, then it must have had the ability to sprot the frink (according to Premise 1), but we know that it did not have this ability (according to Premise 2). Therefore, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
