It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered. Here's why:\n\n1. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned (this is the first statement).\n2. However, we know that the fleeg was not surned (this is the second statement).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
