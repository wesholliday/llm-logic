We know that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, because the statement says \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. We also know that either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer, because this is what the second statement says.\n3. If the notebook were sitting on the nightstand, it would be contradicting the first statement, so we can rule out that possibility.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
