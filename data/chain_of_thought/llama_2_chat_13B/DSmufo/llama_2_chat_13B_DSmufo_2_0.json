We know that \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that there is no requirement for the book to be resting on the table.\n2. We also know that \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This means that the book must either be on the table or on the shelf.\n3. If the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf (based on the second statement).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
