This is because the phrase \"it's not the case that\" implies negation.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This premise states that there are only two possible locations for Fido: the garden or inside. Since we have already established that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
