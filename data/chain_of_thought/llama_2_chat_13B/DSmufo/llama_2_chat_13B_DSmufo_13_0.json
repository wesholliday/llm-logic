This means that the toy can be anywhere except on the bookshelf.\n2. Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. This means that the toy can either be on the bookshelf or in the toy box, but it cannot be anywhere else.\n3. If the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box. This is because there is no other place where the toy could be except for the bookshelf and the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
