We know that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This means that the pen cannot be on my desk.\n2. We also know that \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n3. Based on the first two statements, we can infer that the pen is not on my desk (since we know it's not the case that it must be there).\n4. Therefore, the only possible location for the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
