We know that \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" This means that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist, but it does not necessarily mean that it is charging on the dresser.\n2. However, we also know that \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\" This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it is charging on the dresser. In other words, if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
