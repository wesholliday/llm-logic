We know that the phone cannot be ringing in the kitchen because the statement \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\" is true.\n2. This means that the phone must be either in the living room or not ringing at all.\n3. The statement \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room\" is true because there is no possibility of the phone being in the kitchen if it is not ringing.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
