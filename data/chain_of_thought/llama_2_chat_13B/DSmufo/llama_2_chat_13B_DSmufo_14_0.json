From this premise, we can infer that there is at least one possibility where the milk is not chilling in the fridge (inference 1).\n3. Additionally, we know that \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" (premise).\n4. Since we have already inferred that there is at least one possibility where the milk is not chilling in the fridge, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter (inference 2).\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
