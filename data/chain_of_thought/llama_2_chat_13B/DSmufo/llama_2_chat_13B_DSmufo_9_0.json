Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nI will assume that the first statement is true, meaning that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box, right? Because if it were blending in on the floor, we would have seen it already since we know it's not there.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, can we infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box?\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
