This means that the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet.\n2. Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. This means that the umbrella is either in the closet or in the car, but it cannot be both.\n3. If the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
