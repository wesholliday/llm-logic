(Assuming there is adequate water and other necessary conditions for the lawn to grow.)\n2. Fertilizing the lawn does not guarantee that there will be enough water for the lawn to grow. Droughts can still occur even if the lawn is fertilized.\n3. If there is a drought, it is possible that the lawn may not be lush and green even if it is fertilized. The lack of water would likely outweigh the benefits of the fertilizer.\n\nAnswer: no",
