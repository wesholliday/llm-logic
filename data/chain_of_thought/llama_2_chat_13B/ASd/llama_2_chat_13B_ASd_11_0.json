Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" implies that getting enough sleep is sufficient to prevent tiredness.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\" This statement is a combination of two clauses: \"get enough sleep\" and \"do hard labor.\"\n\nIf we assume that the first clause \"get enough sleep\" is true, then it follows that the second clause \"do hard labor\" must also be true, because if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\n\nTherefore, if we start with the premise \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired,\" we can infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: yes",
