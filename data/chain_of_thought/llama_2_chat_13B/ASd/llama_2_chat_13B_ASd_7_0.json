The premise \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" implies that the oven is a source of heat for the kitchen.\n2. A pilot light is a small flame that is kept burning inside the oven to ignite the gas burners when needed.\n3. If the pilot light is out, it means that the oven is not currently using gas to heat the kitchen.\n4. Therefore, if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, it is possible that the kitchen is not warm, because the oven is not currently providing heat.\n\nAnswer: no",
