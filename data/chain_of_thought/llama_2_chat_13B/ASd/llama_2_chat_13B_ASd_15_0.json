This is a logical statement, as charging a phone with a dead battery will typically restore its power.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the question: \"If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with an added condition that the phone has a dead battery.\n\nSo, if we assume that the first statement is true (i.e., charging my phone will result in it having power), then we can infer that the second statement is also true (i.e., charging my phone and it having a dead battery will result in it having power).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
