This statement implies that the car is protected from any potential dangers outside of the garage.\n3. If the garage is flooding, then there must be water inside the garage.\n4. Water can damage or destroy a car, so if the garage is flooding, it is likely that the car would be damaged or destroyed.\n5. Therefore, if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, it is not safe to assume that the car is safe.\n\nAnswer: no",
