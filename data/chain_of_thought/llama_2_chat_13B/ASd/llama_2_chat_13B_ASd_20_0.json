Expiration refers to the date after which the medication may no longer be effective or may even become harmful.\n\nSo, if I take medication that has expired, it is possible that the medication may not be effective in treating my condition, and it may even cause harm. Therefore, we cannot infer that taking expired medication will make me feel better.\n\nAnswer: no",
