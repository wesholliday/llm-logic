This implies that a well-written essay is a necessary condition for getting an A.\n3. However, it does not necessarily mean that a well-written essay is sufficient to guarantee an A.\n4. If the essay is turned in late, it may be penalized with a lower grade or even fail to meet the deadline, which could affect the final grade.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: no",
