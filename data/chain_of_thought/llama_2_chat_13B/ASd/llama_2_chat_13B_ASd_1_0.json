The statement \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" implies that when a match is struck, it will produce a flame.\n2. If we add the additional condition \"and it has been soaked in water,\" we are essentially saying that even if the match is struck, it may not produce a flame if it has been soaked in water.\n3. However, since being soaked in water would likely extinguish any existing flame, it follows that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will not light.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
