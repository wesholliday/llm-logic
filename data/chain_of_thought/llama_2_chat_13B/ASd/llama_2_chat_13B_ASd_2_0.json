The premise is \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\" This implies that going to the concert is a sufficient condition for having a good time.\n2. The conclusion is \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\" This is the opposite of the original premise, as it suggests that even if a bomb goes off, we will still have a good time.\n3. To infer the conclusion, we need to assume that going to the concert is still a sufficient condition for having a good time, even if a bomb goes off.\n4. However, this assumption seems unlikely, as a bomb going off would likely ruin the concert and make it an unsafe environment.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
