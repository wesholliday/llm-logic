From the premise \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would have been in the den.\n3. Therefore, if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf would not have been in the den.\n4. So, based on the first premise \"The wolf was not in the den,\" we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
