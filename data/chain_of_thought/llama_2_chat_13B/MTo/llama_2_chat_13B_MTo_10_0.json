If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nI need to determine if we can infer that the dog was inside based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the cat was not outside. This means that the cat must have been inside.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" If we substitute \"not outside\" for \"inside\" in this statement, we get: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n\nSince we know that the cat was not outside (from statement 1), we can conclude that the dog must have been not inside. In other words, the dog was inside!\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
