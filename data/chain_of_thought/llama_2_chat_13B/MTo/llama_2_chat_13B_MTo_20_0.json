If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nI need to determine if we can infer that the apple was not red based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. The banana was not yellow. This statement simply tells us that the banana was not yellow. It doesn't provide any information about the apple.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana would have been yellow. However, since the banana was not yellow, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nNow, let me put both statements together and think about what we can infer:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (statement 2). But we know that the banana was not yellow (statement 1), so we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
