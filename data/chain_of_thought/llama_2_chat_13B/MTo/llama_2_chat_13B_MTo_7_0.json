That's given.\n\nAnd we also know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well.\n\nNow, let's assume that Alex did finish the race. If Alex finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well, since \"if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\".\n\nBut we know that Chris did not finish the race. So, if Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
