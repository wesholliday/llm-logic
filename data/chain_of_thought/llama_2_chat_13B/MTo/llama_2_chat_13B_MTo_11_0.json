We are also given the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n3. To infer whether the cake was not chocolate, we need to determine if the muffins being not blueberry implies that the cake was not chocolate.\n4. If the muffins were not blueberry, it means that they were either not blueberry or they were some other type of muffin.\n5. Since we know that the muffins were not blueberry, we can conclude that they were not chocolate (because if they were blueberry, they would have been chocolate).\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
