This means that if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue.\n\nSo, if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue, but since we know that the truck was not blue, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
