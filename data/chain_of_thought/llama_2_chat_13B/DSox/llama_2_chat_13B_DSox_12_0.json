This sentence tells us that the smip is either in a state of being shripped or it is in a state of being lupped.\n\nSince we know that the smip is not lupped, we can conclude that the only possible state for the smip is being shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the two sentences, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
