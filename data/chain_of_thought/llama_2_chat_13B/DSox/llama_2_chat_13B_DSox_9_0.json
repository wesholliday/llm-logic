This means that the twonk is not in a state of being plinked.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\". This statement is saying that either the twonk is varnished or it is in a state of being plinked.\n\nIf we assume that the twonk is not varnished (since we know it is not plinked), then we can conclude that the twonk must be in a state of being plinked, since the only other option is that it is varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
