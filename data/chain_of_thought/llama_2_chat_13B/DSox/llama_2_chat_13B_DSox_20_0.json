This statement tells us that either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\n\nSo, if we assume that the fleeg is not bluttered (i.e., we take the first alternative), then we know that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nBut we already know that the fleeg is not surned, so this assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
