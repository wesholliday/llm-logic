This sentence tells us that either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed, but it does not tell us which one is true.\n\nHowever, since we know that the wug is not bimmed, we can infer that the wug must be flooped.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question 'From 'The wug is not bimmed' together with 'Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed', can we infer 'The wug is flooped'? is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
