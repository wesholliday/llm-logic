This premise tells us that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nSo, putting these two premises together, we can conclude that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled. In other words, if \"The smonk is not plagged\" is true, then \"The smonk is vreebled\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
