From this statement, we can infer that the dreb is either vroombed or spent (logical consequence).\n3. Therefore, we have two possible cases:\n\t* Case 1: The dreb is vroombed.\n\t* Case 2: The dreb is spent.\n4. Now, let's consider each case separately:\n\t* Case 1: If the dreb is vroombed, then it is not spent (by definition of \"vroombed\").\n\t* Case 2: If the dreb is spent, then it is not vroombed (by definition of \"spent\").\n5. Based on these two cases, we can conclude that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed (logical consequence).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'The dreb is not spened' together with 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened', can we infer 'The dreb is vroombed'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
