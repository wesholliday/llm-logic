This statement implies that the glip must be either slogged (i.e., slow and sluggish) or tragged (i.e., trapped).\n\nSince we have already established that the glip is not trapped (i.e., not tragged), we can conclude that it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'The glip is not tragged' together with 'Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged', can we infer 'The glip is slogged'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
