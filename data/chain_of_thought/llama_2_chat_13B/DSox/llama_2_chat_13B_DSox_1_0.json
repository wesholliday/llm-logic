This statement implies that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n\nSo, putting these two statements together, we can infer that if the flugel is not zargled (which we already know from the first statement), then it must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'The flugel is not zargled' together with 'Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled', can we infer 'The flugel is blimmed'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
