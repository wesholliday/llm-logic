This statement tells us that the fribble must either be snurgled (which means to be twisted or distorted) or it must be crinked (which means to have wrinkles or creases).\n\nSince we already know that the fribble does not have any wrinkles or creases (from the first statement), we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
