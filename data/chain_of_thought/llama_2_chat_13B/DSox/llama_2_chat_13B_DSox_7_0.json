The sentence \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked\" states that the whiffle must be either shanked or tinked, with no middle ground.\n3. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked (since there is no other option).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
