Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" implies that there is no necessity for the sneg to have been crampled. In other words, it is possible for the sneg to exist without being crampled.\n\nIf the sneg is not necessarily crampled, then it is possible for the sneg to be in a state where it is not crampled. This means that the sneg might not have been crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg might not have been crampled based on the statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
