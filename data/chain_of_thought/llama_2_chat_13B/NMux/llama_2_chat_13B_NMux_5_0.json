The statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" means that it is possible for the zinger to exist without being fraggled.\n2. If the zinger is possible without being fraggled, then it is also possible for the zinger to not be fraggled.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger might not have been fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
