Here's my reasoning:\n\nFrom the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed,\" we can infer that there is no necessity for the splat to have been morphed. In other words, it is possible for the splat to exist without being morphed.\n\nNow, if it is possible for the splat to exist without being morphed, then it is also possible for the splat not to be morphed. This means that the splat might not have been morphed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
