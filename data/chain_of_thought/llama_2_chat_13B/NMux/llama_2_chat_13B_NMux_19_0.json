The statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" means that it is possible for the smonk to exist without being vreebled.\n2. If the smonk is not necessarily vreebled, then it is possible for the smonk to be something other than vreebled.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk might not have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
