Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" implies that there is a possibility that the grommet might not have been sploffed. This is because the word \"must\" implies a certainty or necessity, and the speaker is denying that this certainty exists.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet might not have been sploffed, but we cannot say for sure whether it was or wasn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
