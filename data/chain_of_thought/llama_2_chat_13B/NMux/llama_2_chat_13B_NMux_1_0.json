The statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" means that it is possible for the flugel to exist without being blimmed.\n2. If the flugel does not need to be blimmed, then it might not have been blimmed.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
