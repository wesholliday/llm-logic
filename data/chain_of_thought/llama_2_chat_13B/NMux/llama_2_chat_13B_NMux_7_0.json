Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" means that it is not necessary for the whiffle to have been shanked. In other words, there are possible scenarios where the whiffle could have been hit without being shanked.\n\nNow, if we infer from this statement that the whiffle might not have been shanked, we are essentially saying that it is possible for the whiffle to have been hit without being shanked. This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" implies that there are scenarios where the whiffle could have been hit without being shanked, but it does not necessarily mean that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the whiffle might not have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
