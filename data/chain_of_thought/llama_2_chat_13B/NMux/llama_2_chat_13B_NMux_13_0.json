Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" means that it is possible for the glip to exist without being slogged. In other words, there is no logical necessity for the glip to be slogged.\n\nFrom this premise, we can infer that the glip might not have been slogged. This is because if there were no possibility of the glip being slogged, then it must be the case that it has not been slogged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
