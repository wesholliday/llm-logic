This means that there are only two possible states of the shank: plooked or nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"The shank might not be nugged\". This means that the shank might not be in the state of being nugged. If the shank is not nugged, then it must be in the state of being plooked, because there are no other states possible.\n\nSo, based on the two premises, we can infer that the shank is plooked. This is because if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked, and we know that the shank might not be nugged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
