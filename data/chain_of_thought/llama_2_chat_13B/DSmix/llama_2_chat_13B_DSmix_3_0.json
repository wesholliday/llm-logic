This means that there are only two possible states of the splat: morphed or quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This tells us that the splat might not be in the state of being quanked. But if it's not quanked, then it must be in the state of being morphed, because there are only two possible states and we already know that it's not quanked.\n\nSo, based on these two premises, we can infer that the splat is morphed. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
