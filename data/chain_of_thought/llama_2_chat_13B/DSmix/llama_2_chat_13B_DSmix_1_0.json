This means that there are only two possible states of the flugel: blimmed or zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The flugel might not be zargled\". This statement implies that the flugel might not be in the state of being zargled. In other words, it is possible that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nSo, if the flugel might not be zargled, then we can infer that the flugel is blimmed. This is because the only two possible states of the flugel are blimmed and zargled, and if the flugel might not be zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
