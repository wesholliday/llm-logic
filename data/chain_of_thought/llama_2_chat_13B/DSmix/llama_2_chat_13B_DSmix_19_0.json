This means that there are only two possible states of the smonk: vreebled or plagged.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The smonk might not be plagged\". This statement implies that the smonk might not be in the state of being plagged. In other words, it is possible that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nSo, if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled, because we know from the first statement that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
