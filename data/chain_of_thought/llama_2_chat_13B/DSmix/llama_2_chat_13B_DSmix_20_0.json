There is no middle ground here, it's either one or the other.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"The fleeg might not be surned\". This sentence suggests that the fleeg might not be surned, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is bluttered. In fact, if the fleeg is not surned, then it could still be either bluttered or not bluttered.\n\nSo, based on these two sentences, we can infer that the fleeg might be bluttered, but we cannot definitively say that it is bluttered. There is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned and therefore not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
