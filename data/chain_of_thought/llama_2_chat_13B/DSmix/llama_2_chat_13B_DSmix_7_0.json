This means that there are only two possible states of the whiffle: shanked or not shanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"The whiffle might not be tinked\". This tells us that the whiffle might not be in the state of being tinked. But if it is not tinked, then it must be in the state of being shanked, because there are only two possible states as we established earlier.\n\nSo, based on the two premises, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked. This is because if it is not tinked, then it must be shanked, and there is no other possible state for the whiffle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
