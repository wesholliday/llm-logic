The wug is sproinged: If the wug is sproinged, then it must be true that \"The wug is sproinged\" (this is a logical necessity).\n2. The wug is not garpled: If the wug is not garpled, then it must be true that \"The wug is not garpled\" (this is also a logical necessity).\n\nGiven these two possibilities, we can conclude that either the wug is sproinged or it is not garpled. This means that we have inferred that the wug is either sproinged or not garpled, which is equivalent to saying that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
