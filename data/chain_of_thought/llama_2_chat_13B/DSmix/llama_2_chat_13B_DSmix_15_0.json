This means that there are only two possible states of the dreb: vroombed and spent.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"The dreb might not be spened\". This sentence implies that the dreb might not be spent, which means that it must be in one of the other possible states - vroombed.\n\nSo, based on the two sentences together, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed. This is because the only other possible state of the dreb, besides vroombed, is spent, and we know that the dreb might not be spent. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
