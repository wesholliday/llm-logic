There is no third option.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"The fribble might not be crinked\". This sentence implies that the fribble might not have the property of being crinked. However, it does not necessarily mean that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nSo, based on these two sentences, we can infer that the fribble is either snurgled or not crinked, but we cannot infer that it is definitely snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
