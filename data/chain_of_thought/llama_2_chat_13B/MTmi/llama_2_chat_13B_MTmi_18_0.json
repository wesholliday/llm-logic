The truck might not have been metal.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. How do we know this? Well, if the truck was not metal, then it must have been made of some other material. But if the truck was not metal, and the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been able to carry the plastic doll without any issues. Therefore, since the truck might not have been metal, it is likely that the doll was not plastic either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
