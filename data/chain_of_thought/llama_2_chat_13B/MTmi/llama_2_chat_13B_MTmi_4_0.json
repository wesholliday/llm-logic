The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nSo, if we assume that the alien visited Mars, then we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. However, we are also given that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the alien visited Mars, because we don't know for sure whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
