This is based on the information given in the premise.\n2. We also know that Erin might not have taken a train. This means that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, even if Sam took a plane.\n3. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin might not have taken a train.\n4. Therefore, if we know that Erin did not take a train, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nNow, let me answer the question:\n\nAnswer: yes",
