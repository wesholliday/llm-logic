Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. But since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it's possible that he didn't buy it, even if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nSo, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt, and we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
