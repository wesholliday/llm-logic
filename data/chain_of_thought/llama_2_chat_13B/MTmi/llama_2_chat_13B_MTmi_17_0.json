This is based on the information provided in the premise.\n2. We also know that Kate might not have eaten salad. This is given in the second premise.\n3. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n4. Therefore, if we assume that Ben ate pasta, we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nNow, based on this reasoning, I will answer the question:\n\nAnswer: yes",
