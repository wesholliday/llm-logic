Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\" implies that if the room was tidied, it was not done so completely or thoroughly. This means that there may still be some mess or disorganization remaining in the room, even after tidying.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\". This statement is the opposite of the original statement, so if we can infer one from the other, we should be able to deduce that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it must have been tidied.\n\nHowever, this inference does not logically follow from the original statement. Just because the room was not tidied thoroughly, it does not mean that it was not tidied at all. There is a possibility that the room was tidied to some extent, but not completely or thoroughly. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\n\nAnswer: no",
