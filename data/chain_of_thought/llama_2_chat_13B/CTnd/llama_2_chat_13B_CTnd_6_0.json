Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" implies that if the clothes were washed, then there is a possibility that they were not washed properly. This means that the condition \"washed\" does not guarantee the condition \"properly washed\".\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement \"If the clothes were not washed, then they were washed properly\". This statement is the opposite of the original statement, so if we negate it, we get:\n\n\"If the clothes were not washed, then they were not washed properly\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the conditions reversed. So, if we assume that the clothes were not washed, we can infer that they were not washed properly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
