The statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" implies that there is a negative correlation between completing the job and doing it well. In other words, if the job is completed, then it is likely that it was not done well.\n2. This implies that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed. This is because if the job was done well, then it would not be included in the category of jobs that were not completed well.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
