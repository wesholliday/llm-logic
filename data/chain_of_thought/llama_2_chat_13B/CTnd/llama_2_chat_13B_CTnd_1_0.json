The statement \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" implies that there is a correlation between the two conditions - if it's raining, then it can't be raining hard.\n2. This implies that the opposite of \"raining hard\" is \"not raining hard\".\n3. Therefore, if we assume that \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\", we can infer that \"If it's not raining hard, then it's not raining\".\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
