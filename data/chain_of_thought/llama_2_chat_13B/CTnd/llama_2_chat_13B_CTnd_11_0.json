Let me think about it for a moment.\n\nOkay, I've got it! The two sentences are logically equivalent. If I went to the store and did not buy vegetables, then I must have not bought any vegetables. And if I did not go to the store and bought vegetables, then I must have not gone to the store.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\n\nAnswer: yes",
