Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" implies that if the issue was brought up at all, it was only briefly mentioned and not explored thoroughly. This means that if the issue was discussed in depth, it would not have been discussed at all, because if it had been, we would know that it was not discussed in depth.\n\nSo, to infer \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is a logical conclusion based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
