Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" implies that if the room was cleaned, it was not done so thoroughly. This means that there may be some areas of the room that were not properly cleaned or tidied up.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\". This statement is saying that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it must not have been cleaned at all. This is a contradictory statement to the original statement, as we know that the room was cleaned (according to the first statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. This is because the two statements are contradictory, and one of them must be false. In this case, the second statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" is false, so we can conclude that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was cleaned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
