This means that if the customer was greeted, it is not the case that they were greeted warmly (logical negation of 1)\n3. Therefore, if the customer was greeted, it is not possible that they were greeted warmly (conclusion)\n\nNow, based on these premises, can we infer that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted?\n\nAnswer: yes",
