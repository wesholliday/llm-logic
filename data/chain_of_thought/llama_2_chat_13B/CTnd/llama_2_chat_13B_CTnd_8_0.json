The statement \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\" implies that addressing the issue did not solve the problem or resolve the situation.\n2. This means that if the issue was addressed effectively, it would have solved the problem or resolved the situation, which is the opposite of the given statement.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed (i.e., the problem or situation still exists).\n\nAnswer: yes",
