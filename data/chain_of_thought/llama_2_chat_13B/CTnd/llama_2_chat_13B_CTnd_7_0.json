Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\" implies that if the customer received service, it was not quick or timely. This means that there is a negative relationship between being served and being served promptly.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite statement: \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\" This statement is the negation of the original statement, so we can infer that if the customer was served promptly, it means that he was not served (i.e., the service was not quick or timely).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n\nAnswer: yes",
