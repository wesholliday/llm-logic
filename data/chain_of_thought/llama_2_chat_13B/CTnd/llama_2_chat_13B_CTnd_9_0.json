The statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" implies that if instructions were provided, they were not communicated effectively.\n2. This statement suggests that clear instruction-giving is mutually exclusive with unclear explanation. In other words, if instructions are given, it is unlikely that they will be explained clearly.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given. This is because clear explanation and effective communication of instructions are incompatible with the idea that instructions were given but not explained clearly.\n\nAnswer: yes",
