The statement \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long\" implies that there is a negative relationship between studying and studying long. In other words, if Jane studied, then it is unlikely that she studied long.\n2. The statement \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" is the negation of the first statement. It means that if Jane studied long, then she did not study.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if Jane studied long, then she did not study. This inference is based on the negative relationship between studying and studying long.\n\nAnswer: yes",
