This means that if I ate a meal, then it must have been a small meal, because if it were a large meal, I would not have eaten it.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\". This statement is saying that if I ate a large meal, then I must not have eaten any meal at all.\n\nSo, if we assume that I ate a large meal, then we can infer that I did not eat any meal, because a large meal would contradict the first statement. Therefore, the second statement must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
