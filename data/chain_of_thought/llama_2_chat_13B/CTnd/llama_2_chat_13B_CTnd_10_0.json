So, we can start by negating the condition:\n\n\"If advice was not offered, then advice was helpful.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the sentence:\n\n\"If advice was not offered, then advice was helpful.\"\n\nThis sentence is saying that if no advice was given, then the advice must have been helpful. This doesn't make logical sense, as the absence of something (in this case, advice) does not necessarily mean that it would be helpful.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the statement \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" cannot be inferred from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
