This means that if Ann exercised, then she must have exercised lightly or moderately, but not strenuously\n3. Therefore, if Ann exercised strenuously, then she cannot have exercised lightly or moderately (contradiction)\n4. Hence, we can infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise at all (logical conclusion)\n\nAnswer: yes",
