The statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" implies that if Alex exercised at all, he did not exercise extensively or intensively.\n2. This means that there is a possibility that Alex may have exercised, but not to a significant degree.\n3. Now, let's consider the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This statement is saying that if Alex exercised a lot, then he did not exercise at all.\n4. Based on the first statement, we know that Alex may have exercised, but not to a significant degree. Therefore, if we assume that Alex exercised much, it would mean that he did not exercise extensively or intensively.\n5. So, based on the two statements, we can infer that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
