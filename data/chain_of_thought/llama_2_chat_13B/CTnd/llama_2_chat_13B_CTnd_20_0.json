This statement implies that if a recommendation was made, then it must be a weak or non-strong recommendation, since strong recommendations were excluded from the premise.\n3. Therefore, if a strong recommendation was made, then it cannot be the case that a recommendation was made, since we know that strong recommendations were not made.\n4. Conclusion: If a strong recommendation was made, then no recommendation was made.\n\nAnswer: yes",
