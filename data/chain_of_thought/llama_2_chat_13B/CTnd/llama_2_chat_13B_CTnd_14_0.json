Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully\" implies that if the meal was prepared, then it was not done with care or attention to detail. This means that if the meal was prepared, then it is unlikely that it was prepared carefully.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\". This statement is the opposite of the original statement, so if we negate it, we get:\n\n\"If the meal was not prepared carefully, then it was prepared\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, so we can infer that if the meal was not prepared carefully, then it was prepared. Therefore, we can infer from the first statement that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was prepared.\n\nAnswer: yes",
