This means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n\nThe second premise states that the pen might not be on my desk. This means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk, even if it is not in my bag.\n\nThe conclusion states that the pen is in my bag. This conclusion logically follows from the first two premises because if the pen is not on my desk (as stated in the second premise), then it must be in my bag (based on the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion that is supported by the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
