This means that if the notebook is not in the drawer, then it must be somewhere else, and the nightstand is one possible location.\n\nThe second premise states that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, even if it is not in the drawer.\n\nThe conclusion states that the notebook is in the drawer. This conclusion logically follows from the first two premises because if the notebook is not in the drawer and it might not be sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
