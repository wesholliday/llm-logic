This premise states that the missing sock can either be in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed, there is no other option.\n\nThe second premise is 'The missing sock might not be under the bed'. This premise suggests that the missing sock might not be under the bed, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could be in the laundry basket.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'. Based on the first premise, we know that the missing sock can either be in the laundry basket or under the bed. If it is not under the bed (as stated in the second premise), then it must be in the laundry basket. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
