This means that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table.\n\nThe second premise states that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that there is a possibility that the book is not resting on the table, even if it is not on the shelf.\n\nThe conclusion states that the book is on the shelf. This conclusion logically follows from the first two premises because if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the argument is logically valid. Therefore, I will answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
