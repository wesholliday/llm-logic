This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nThe second premise states that the watch might not be on his wrist. This means that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can logically conclude that if the watch might not be on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. This conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
