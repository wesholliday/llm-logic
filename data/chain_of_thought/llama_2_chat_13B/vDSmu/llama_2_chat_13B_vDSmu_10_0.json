This premise states that the missing sock can either be in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed, but it cannot be both.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed'. This premise states that the missing sock cannot be under the bed, which means that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
