This means that if the shoes are not in the closet, then they must be lined up by the door.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door. This means that there is no requirement for the shoes to be lined up by the door, even if they are not in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
