This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that there is no possibility that the watch is on his wrist, so we can conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nSo, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
