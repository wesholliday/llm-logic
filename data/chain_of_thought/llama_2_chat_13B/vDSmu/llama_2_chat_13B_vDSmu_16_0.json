This means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This means that there is no possibility that the pen is required to be on my desk.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
