This means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be somewhere else, and the only other place it could be is on the bookshelf.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that even if the toy is not in the toy box, it cannot be on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, based on these two premises, we can conclude that the toy is in the toy box. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
