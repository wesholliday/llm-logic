This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's assume that the alien did not visit Mars. In this case, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter because the premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, it is certain that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
