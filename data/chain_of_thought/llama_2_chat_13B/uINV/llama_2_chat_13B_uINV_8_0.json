If the vampire is not awake, then it must be asleep or unconscious.\n\nIf the vampire is asleep or unconscious, then it is unlikely that the mummy would also be awake, because the statement only implies that the mummy was awake if the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
