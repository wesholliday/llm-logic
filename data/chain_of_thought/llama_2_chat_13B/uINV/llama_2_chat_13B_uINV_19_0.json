This is given in the premise of the question.\n2. If Tom did not watch football, then we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball. This is because the statement \"if Tom watched football\" only implies that Jen watched basketball if Tom actually did watch football. It does not imply that Jen will definitely not watch basketball if Tom does not watch football.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
