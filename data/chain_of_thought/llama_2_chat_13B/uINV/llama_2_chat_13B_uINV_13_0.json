If the car was not red, then it must have been a different color, like green or black or silver. In this case, the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" does not apply, because the car is not red.\n\nSo, if the car was not red, then we cannot infer that the truck was blue. In fact, we cannot make any inference about the color of the truck based on the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
