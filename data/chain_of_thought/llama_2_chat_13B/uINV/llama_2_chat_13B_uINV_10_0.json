This statement is saying that if a certain condition (the dog being inside) is true, then another condition (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n3. So, if we know that the dog is not inside, we can infer that the cat is not outside.\n4. In other words, if we negate the statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\", we get \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\".\n5. Therefore, if the dog was not inside, we can infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
