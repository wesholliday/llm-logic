That means that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let me think... if the book was not written by James, then it must be a different type of book altogether. Maybe it's a romance novel, a sci-fi story, or a self-help guide. But it definitely can't be a mystery novel because James only writes mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no \ud83d\ude0a",
