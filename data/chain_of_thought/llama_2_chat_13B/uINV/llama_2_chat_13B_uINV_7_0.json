This implies that Chris also finished the race, because the statement says \"if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nNow, if Alex did not finish the race, then it means that he did not complete the entire race and did not cross the finish line. In this case, it is possible that Chris may or may not have finished the race, because we don't know what happened to him.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. The statement only implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it does not imply the opposite (i.e., if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race).\n\nAnswer: no",
