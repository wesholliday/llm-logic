This statement is saying that if a certain condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then another condition (Sue being at the wedding) is also true.\n3. In other words, if we know that Mary was at the wedding, then we can infer that Sue was also at the wedding.\n4. Now, let's consider the opposite situation: if Mary was not at the wedding.\n5. If Mary was not at the wedding, then the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" would be false.\n6. This means that we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding just because Mary was not there.\n\nAnswer: no",
