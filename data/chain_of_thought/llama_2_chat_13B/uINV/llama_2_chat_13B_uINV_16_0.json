This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies if the antecedent (the first part) is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton.\"\n3. If the shirt was not cotton, then the antecedent is false, and we cannot infer that the pants were denim.\n4. Therefore, if the shirt was not cotton, we cannot infer that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
