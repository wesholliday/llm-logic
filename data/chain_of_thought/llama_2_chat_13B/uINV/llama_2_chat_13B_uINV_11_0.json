In this case, we know that the muffins cannot be blueberry, because the statement says \"if the cake was chocolate.\" So, if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins must not have been blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
