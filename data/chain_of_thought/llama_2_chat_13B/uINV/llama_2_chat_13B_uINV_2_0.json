This statement is a conditional statement, so we need to consider the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n3. If the griffin was not in the forest, then the statement \"the unicorn was in the forest\" would be false.\n4. Therefore, if the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
