The premise \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" implies that if the glip was subjected to a certain action (slogging), then it must have been affected by that action (tragging).\n2. The second premise \"The glip was not tragged\" means that the glip was not affected by the action of tragging.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the glip was not tragged, then it must not have been slogged either, since slogging is a necessary condition for tragging.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
