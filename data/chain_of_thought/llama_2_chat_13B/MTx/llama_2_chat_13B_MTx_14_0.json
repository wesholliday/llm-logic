The sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" implies that if the clug was fleeked (i.e., had a certain quality or state), then it would have snugged (i.e., done something else).\n2. The sentence \"The clug did not snugged\" tells us that the clug did not do the thing that it would have done if it had been fleeked.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked, because if it had been fleeked, it would have snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
