The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" implies that if the zinger was fraggled (i.e., broken or damaged), then it must have been smoogled (i.e., covered in a thick, sticky substance).\n2. The statement \"The zinger was not smoogled\" means that the zinger was not covered in a thick, sticky substance.\n3. If the zinger was not fraggled (i.e., it was not broken or damaged), then it must have been in good condition and not smoogled.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
