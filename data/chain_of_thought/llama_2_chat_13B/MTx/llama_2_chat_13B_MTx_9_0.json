We know that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked (whatever that means), then it must have been varnished.\n2. We also know that \"The twonk was not varnished.\" This means that the twonk was not treated with varnish.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can logically infer that the twonk was not plinked. If the twonk had been plinked, it would have been varnished, but since it was not varnished, it must not have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
