Here we go!\n\nSo, the two statements given are:\n\n1. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n2. \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n\nOkay, let's think about what these statements might mean. The first statement suggests that if the sneg (whatever that is) was crampled (presumably meaning compressed or squashed), then it would have sprouted the frink (whatever that is). The second statement tells us that the sneg did not sprout the frink.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. If the sneg was crampled, then it would have sprouted the frink, but since it didn't, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
