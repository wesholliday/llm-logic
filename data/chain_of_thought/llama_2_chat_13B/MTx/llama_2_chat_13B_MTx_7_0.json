The premise \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" implies that if the whiffle was hit in a certain way (i.e., shanked), it would produce a specific sound (i.e., tinked).\n2. The statement \"The whiffle did not tink\" means that the whiffle did not produce the expected sound of tinked when it was hit.\n3. Based on the premise and the statement, we can logically infer that the whiffle was not shanked because if it had been shanked, it would have produced the sound of tinked.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
