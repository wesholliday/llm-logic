The sentence \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" implies that the scarf is either in one of those two locations or it is not present at all.\n2. The sentence \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" means that the scarf cannot be found on the coat rack.\n3.
