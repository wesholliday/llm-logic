It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer. Here's why:\n\n3. If the notebook were sitting on the nightstand, it would be a case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand (since it's not in the drawer). But we know from statement 2 that this is not the case.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
