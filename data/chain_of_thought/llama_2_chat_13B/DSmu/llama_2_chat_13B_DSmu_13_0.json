It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box. Here's why:\n\n1. If the toy were sitting on the bookshelf, it would be a case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, which contradicts the second statement.\n2. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
