This means that one of two possibilities is true: either Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n2. We also know that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that the second possibility (Fido must be in the garden) is not true.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
