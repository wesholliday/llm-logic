This means that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, we also know that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies were hidden in the pantry, we would know about it because it's not the case.\n\nSo, if the cookies are not in the jar and they must be hidden in the pantry, but we know that they are not hidden in the pantry, then where are they? The only possible conclusion is that the cookies are in the jar!\n\nAnswer: yes",
