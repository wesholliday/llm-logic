The statement \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\" implies that the umbrella cannot be both in the car and tucked away in the closet at the same time.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" means that the umbrella is not required to be tucked away in the closet.\n3. Therefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
