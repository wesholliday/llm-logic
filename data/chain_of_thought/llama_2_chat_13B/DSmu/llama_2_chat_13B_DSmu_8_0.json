This means that one of these two possibilities must be true.\n\nIf the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nHowever, we are also given that \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control cannot be hiding under the couch, which means that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
