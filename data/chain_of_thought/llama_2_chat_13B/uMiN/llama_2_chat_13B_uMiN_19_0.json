Let's assume that the watch is in the owner's pocket or on their wrist.\n\nIf the watch is in the owner's pocket, then it cannot be charging on the dresser because pockets do not have charging stations. Therefore, we can infer that the watch must not be charging on the dresser.\n\nOn the other hand, if the watch is on the owner's wrist, then it could potentially be charging on the dresser, but we cannot know for sure without more information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the watch must not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
