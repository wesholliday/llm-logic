This means that we cannot infer that the shoes must be in the closet based on the fact that they might not be there. In other words, the absence of the shoes in the closet does not necessarily mean that they are somewhere else; it simply means that they might not be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"the shoes must be in the closet\" cannot be inferred based on the fact that they might not be there.\n\nAnswer: no",
