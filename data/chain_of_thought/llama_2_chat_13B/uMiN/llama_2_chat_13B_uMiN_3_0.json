This statement is saying that it's possible that the book was not written by James, even though we know that James is a famous author.\n2. If the book might not have been written by James, then it's not the case that the book must have been written by James. This follows logically from the first statement, because if the book might not have been written by James, then it's not certain that it was written by James.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James. This conclusion follows from the previous two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
