From the premise \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink,\" we can infer that if the grommet had been sploffed, it would have plopped the frink.\n3. Since the grommet did not plop the frink (step 1), we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
