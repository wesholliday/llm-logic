We are also given the sentence \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\".\n3. From these two sentences, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then it would have plagged (based on the second sentence).\n4. However, since the first sentence states that the smonk did not plagged, we can conclude that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
