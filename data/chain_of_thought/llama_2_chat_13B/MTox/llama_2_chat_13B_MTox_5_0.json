We are also given the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\".\n3. To infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\", we need to negate the second statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\". This gives us \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\".\n4. Since we know that the zinger was not smoogled (given statement 1), we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
