The second sentence is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This implies that if the wug was in a state of being flooped, then it would have performed the action of bimming the zoint.\n3. Based on the first sentence, we know that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped, because if it was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
