This means that if the twonk was plinked (which is to say, if it was struck or hit with something), then it must have been varnished.\n\nSo, if we assume that the twonk was plinked, then we can infer that it was varnished, based on the second statement.\n\nBut wait, we started with the fact that the twonk was not varnished, according to the first statement! This means that we cannot assume that the twonk was plinked, because if it had been plinked, it would have been varnished, and we know that it wasn't varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked, based on the fact that it was not varnished and the fact that if it had been plinked, it would have been varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
