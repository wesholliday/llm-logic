We are also given the sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n3. From these two sentences, we can infer that the word \"snugged\" is a synonym of \"fleeked\".\n4. Therefore, if the clug was not fleeked, then it did not snugged.\n5. So, we can conclude that \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
