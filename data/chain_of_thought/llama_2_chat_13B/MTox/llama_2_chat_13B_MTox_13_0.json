We know that \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This means that if the glip was slogged (i.e., if the condition \"slogged\" is true), then it must also be tragged (i.e., if the condition \"tragged\" is true).\n2. We are given the statement \"The glip was not tragged.\" This means that the condition \"tragged\" is false, since we know that the glip was not tragged.\n3. Based on the first statement, if the glip was slogged, then it would be tragged. But we just established that the glip was not tragged, so we can conclude that the glip was not slogged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
