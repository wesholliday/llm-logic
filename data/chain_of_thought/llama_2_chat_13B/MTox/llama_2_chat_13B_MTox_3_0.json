This is because if the splat were capable of quanking, it would have done so in the absence of any morphing.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This premise tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. But since we know that the splat did not quank, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nSo, putting both premises together, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
