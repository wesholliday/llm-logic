This sentence tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it would be garpled.\n\nSo, if we assume that the wug was sproinged, we can infer that it would be garpled. But we know from the first sentence that the wug is not garpled, so we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
