The premise of the argument is \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\" This means that if the room was tidied, then it was not done so thoroughly.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\" This means that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not actually tidied (i.e., it was not done so thoroughly).\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true. If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly, according to the premise.\n4. Therefore, if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied (by assumption).\n5. However, this implies that the conclusion of the argument is false. If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was tidied, which contradicts the conclusion.\n6. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
