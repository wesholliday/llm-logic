The premise of the argument is \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\" This means that if a recommendation was given, it must be a weak or mediocre one, rather than a strong one.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\" This means that if a strong recommendation was given, then it must not have been given at all.\n3. Now, let's assume that a strong recommendation was made. If this is the case, then by the conclusion of the argument, no recommendation was made. But this is a contradiction, since we started with the assumption that a strong recommendation was made!\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid, because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: no",
