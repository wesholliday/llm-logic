The premise of the argument is \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" This means that if Ben studied, then he did not study with great effort or attention.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This means that if Ben studied with great effort and attention, then he did not actually study.\n3. Now, let's assume that Ben did study. If Ben studied, then he must have studied diligently (by definition of the word \"diligently\"), because he would have needed to put in a lot of effort and attention to do so.\n4. But wait, we just assumed that Ben studied! So, if Ben studied, then he did study diligently.\n5. This leads us to a logical contradiction, because we started with the premise that \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently,\" but we have now reached the conclusion that \"Ben did study diligently.\"\n6. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid, and we can conclude that the argument's conclusion does not follow from its premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
