Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\" This means that if the customer received service, then it must have been slow or inadequate service.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\" This statement is saying that if the customer received prompt service, then it must have been a false positive - the customer was not actually served.\n\nSo, the conclusion is essentially negating the premise. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must be false, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let me think about this for a moment... Hmmm... I believe that the argument is logically valid!\n\nAnswer: yes",
