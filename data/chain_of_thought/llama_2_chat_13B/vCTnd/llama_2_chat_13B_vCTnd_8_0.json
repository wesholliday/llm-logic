The premise of the argument is \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\" This means that if the issue was addressed in some way, then it was not addressed successfully or effectively.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\" This means that if the issue was addressed successfully or effectively, then it was not actually addressed at all.\n3. Now, let's assume that the issue was addressed effectively. This means that the issue was resolved or solved in some way.\n4. According to the conclusion of the argument, if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This means that if the issue was resolved or solved, then it was not actually addressed at all.\n5. This leads to a logical contradiction, since we started with the premise that the issue was addressed, and now we have concluded that it was not addressed.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the argument is logically invalid. The reasoning is flawed because it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAnswer: no",
