            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The premise of the argument is \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" This means that if the issue was brought up and talked about, then it was not thoroughly examined or explored.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" This means that if the issue was thoroughly examined and explored, then it was not brought up or talked about.\n3. Now, let's assume that the issue was discussed. If we apply the premise to this situation, we get: \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" This means that if the issue was brought up and talked about, then it was not thoroughly examined or explored.\n4. However, if the issue was not discussed in depth, then it must have been discussed. This is because the premise states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. Therefore, if the issue was not discussed in depth, then it must have been discussed.\n5. Now, let's assume that the issue was not discussed. If we apply the conclusion to this situation, we get: \"If the issue was not discussed, then it was discussed.\" This means that if the issue was not brought up or talked about, then it was thoroughly examined and explored.\n6. However, this is a contradiction, because we assumed that the issue was not discussed. Therefore, our assumption that the issue was not discussed must be false, and the correct answer is: Answer: no.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid, because it leads to a contradiction.",
