I mean, wouldn't it make more sense to say that if someone received helpful advice, then it was offered, and if someone did not receive helpful advice, then it was not offered?\n\nOh wait, I see what's going on here. The argument is using a negative premise to reach a negative conclusion. In other words, the argument is assuming that if something is not true, then its negation must be true. But this is not always the case!\n\nFor example, just because I don't have a cat, it doesn't mean that I have a dog. The lack of one thing does not necessarily imply the presence of its opposite.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on a flawed assumption about the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. Therefore, I must answer...\n\nAnswer: no",
