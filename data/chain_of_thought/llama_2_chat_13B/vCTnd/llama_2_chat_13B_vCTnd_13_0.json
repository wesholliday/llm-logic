The premise of the argument is \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\" This means that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise extensively or intensively.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This means that if Alex exercised a lot, then he did not exercise at all.\n3. Now, let's assume that Alex did exercise. If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much (by the premise).\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not exercise much (based on the assumption and the premise).\n5. However, this conclusion contradicts the fact that Alex exercised (assumption).\n6. Hence, we can conclude that the argument is logically invalid (because the conclusion contradicts the assumption).\n\nAnswer: no",
