If we assume that directions were provided, then the premise \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" must be true. But then, the conclusion \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" becomes false, because if directions were provided, then they must have been explained clearly (by definition).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
