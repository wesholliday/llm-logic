If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal (premise). And if I did not eat a large meal, then I must not have eaten any meal at all (conclusion).\n\nHmm... it seems like there might be a problem here. If I ate a meal, then I didn't eat a large meal, but that doesn't necessarily mean I didn't eat any meal at all! For example, if I ate a small meal, then I would have eaten a meal, but not a large meal.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid because it assumes that if I didn't eat a large meal, then I must not have eaten any meal at all, which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
