Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\" This means that if the room was cleaned, then it must not have been cleaned thoroughly.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\" This statement is the negation of the premise, so we can rewrite it as \"Not (if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly)\".\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument using truth tables. Here are the possible combinations of truth values for the premises and conclusion:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | True | False |\n| True | False | True |\n| False | True | True |\n| False | False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, regardless of their truth values. Therefore, I answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
