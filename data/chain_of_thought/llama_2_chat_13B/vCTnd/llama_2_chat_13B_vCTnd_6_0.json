Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\" This means that if the clothes were washed, then they must not have been washed properly, because if they had been washed properly, then they would not have been washed.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\" This is the opposite of the premise, so if we assume that the premise is true, then the conclusion must be false.\n\nSo, if we assume that the clothes were washed, then we can conclude that they were not washed properly. But if we assume that the clothes were not washed, then we cannot conclude that they were washed properly, because we don't know whether they were washed or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because it follows a consistent and logical pattern. The premise leads to a conclusion that is opposite to the premise, which means that the argument is sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
