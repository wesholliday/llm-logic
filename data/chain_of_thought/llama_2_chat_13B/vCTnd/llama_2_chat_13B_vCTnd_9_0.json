If we assume that instructions were given, then the premise \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" must be true. But then, if the premise is true, it follows that the conclusion \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" must also be true.\n\nSo, if we assume that instructions were given, then the argument leads to a logical contradiction, because if instructions were given, then they must have been explained clearly (by assumption), but then the conclusion says that instructions were not given. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
