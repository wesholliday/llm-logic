Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\" This means that if the customer was indeed greeted, then they must not have been greeted warmly.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\" This statement is saying that if the customer was greeted warmly, then it is not possible that they were greeted.\n\nSo, if we assume that the customer was greeted (which is the premise of the argument), then we can conclude that they were not greeted warmly. But wait, this means that the conclusion of the argument is actually true!\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical structure and leads to a true conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
