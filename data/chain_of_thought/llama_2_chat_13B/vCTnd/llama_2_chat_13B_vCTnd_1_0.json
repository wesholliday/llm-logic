The premise of the argument is \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This means that if it is raining, then it cannot be raining hard.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" This means that if it is raining hard, then it must not be raining.\n3. Now, let's assume that it is raining. If it is raining, then according to the premise, it cannot be raining hard. Therefore, the conclusion \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" must be true.\n4. However, this leads to a logical contradiction. If it is raining and it cannot be raining hard, then it must not be raining at all. But this contradicts our initial assumption that it is raining.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: no",
