Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\" This means that if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise with a lot of effort or intensity.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" This means that if Ann exercised with a lot of effort or intensity, then she did not actually exercise at all.\n\nNow, let's think about whether this form of argument is logically valid. To determine this, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nIf we assume that Ann exercised, then the premise \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously\" would be true. This means that Ann did not exercise with a lot of effort or intensity.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Ann exercised strenuously, then the conclusion \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" would be false. This is because Ann did exercise with a lot of effort and intensity.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
