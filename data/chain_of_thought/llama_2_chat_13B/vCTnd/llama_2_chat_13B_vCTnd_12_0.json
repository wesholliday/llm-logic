The premise of the argument is \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" This means that if Jane studied, then she must have studied for a short period of time.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" This means that if Jane studied for a long time, then she must not have studied at all.\n3. Now, let's assume that Jane did study for a long time. If this is the case, then the premise of the argument (step 1) would be false, since Jane did study long.\n4. However, if the premise is false, then the conclusion (step 2) must also be false. This means that if Jane studied long, then she did study.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
