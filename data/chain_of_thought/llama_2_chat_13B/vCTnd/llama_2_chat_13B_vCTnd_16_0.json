The premise of the argument is \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\" This means that if the job was finished, then it must have been done poorly.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\" This means that if the job was done well, then it must not have been completed (i.e., it must still be in progress).\n3. Now, let's assume that the job was completed well. If this is the case, then according to the conclusion of the argument, it must not have been completed. This means that the job cannot have been finished, which contradicts the premise of the argument.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
