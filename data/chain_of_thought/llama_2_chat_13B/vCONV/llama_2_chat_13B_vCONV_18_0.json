The premise of the argument is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" This means that if the truck is made of metal, then the doll must be made of plastic.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true. If the doll was plastic, then the truck would have to be metal.\n4. But wait, this implies that the doll cannot be plastic if the truck is not metal! In other words, if the truck is not made of metal, then the doll cannot be made of plastic.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that if the truck was metal, then the doll would have to be plastic. But this is exactly the opposite of what the premise states!\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, I believe that the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Therefore, the answer is...\n\nAnswer: no",
