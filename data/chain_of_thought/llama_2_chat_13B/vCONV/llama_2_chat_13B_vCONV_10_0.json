The premise of the argument is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside the house, then the cat must have been outside.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\" This means that if the cat was outside, then it must be the case that the dog was inside.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n4. Therefore, if the cat was outside, then the dog must have been inside. This is the conclusion of the argument.\n5. So, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
