The premise of the argument is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This means that if the alien went to Mars, then the robot must have gone to Jupiter.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\" This means that if the robot went to Jupiter, then the alien must have gone to Mars.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true, i.e., the alien did visit Mars. If the alien visited Mars, then according to the premise, the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
