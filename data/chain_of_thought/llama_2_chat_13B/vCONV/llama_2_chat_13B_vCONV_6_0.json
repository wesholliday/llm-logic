Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if Sue selected pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\" This means that if Bob selected pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In other words, we need to ask ourselves: does the conclusion logically follow from the premise?\n\nLet's assume that Sue chose pizza. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (by the premise). Therefore, if Bob chose pasta, it is logical to conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
