Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, then it is certain that Erin took a train.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" This means that if Erin took a train, then it is certain that Sam took a plane.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical validity of this argument. If we assume that Sam took a plane, then we can conclude with certainty that Erin took a train, based on the premise. And if we assume that Erin took a train, then we can conclude with certainty that Sam took a plane, based on the conclusion.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because it follows the correct logical form of \"If A, then B\" and \"If B, then A\". Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
