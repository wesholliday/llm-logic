            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The premise of the argument is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement implies that if the apple had been red, then the banana would have been yellow.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This statement implies that if the banana had been yellow, then the apple would have been red.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true. If the apple was red, then the banana would have been yellow.\n4. Therefore, if the banana was yellow, it must have been because the apple was red.\n5. So, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
