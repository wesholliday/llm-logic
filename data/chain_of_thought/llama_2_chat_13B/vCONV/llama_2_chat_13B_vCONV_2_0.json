Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin existed in the forest, then the unicorn also existed in the forest.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\" This means that if the unicorn existed in the forest, then the griffin also existed in the forest.\n\nNow, let's assume that the premise is true. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This means that the unicorn exists in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the conclusion, if the unicorn exists in the forest, then the griffin also exists in the forest. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
