The premise of the argument is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car had been red, then the truck would have been blue.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" This means that if the truck had been blue, then the car would have been red.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n4. If the truck was blue, then the car was red. (This follows logically from the premise.)\n5. Therefore, if the car was red, then the truck was blue, and if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premise, so the argument is sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
