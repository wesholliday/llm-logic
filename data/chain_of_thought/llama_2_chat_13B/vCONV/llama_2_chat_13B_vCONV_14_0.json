Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\" This means that if the bear was present in the case, then the wolf must have been present in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\" This statement is saying that if the wolf was present in the den, then the bear must have been present in the case.\n\nSo, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. If the wolf was in the den, then it's true that the bear was in the case, because of the premise \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
