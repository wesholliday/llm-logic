Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is certain that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" This statement is saying that if the muffins were blueberry, then it is certain that the cake was chocolate.\n\nSo, here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate (premise), then the muffins were blueberry (conclusion).\n2. If the muffins were blueberry (premise), then the cake was chocolate (conclusion).\n\nI can see that the conclusion of the argument is the same as the premise, just with the order of the statements reversed. This means that the argument is logically valid!\n\nAnswer: yes",
