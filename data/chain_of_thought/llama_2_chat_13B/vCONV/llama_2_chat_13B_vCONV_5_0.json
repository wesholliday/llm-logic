Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if Jeff played basketball, then it must be the case that Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" This statement is saying that if Amy played tennis, then it must be the case that Jeff played basketball.\n\nSo, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, and if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
