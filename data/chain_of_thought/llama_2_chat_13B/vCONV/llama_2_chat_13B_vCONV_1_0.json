The premise of the argument is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This means that if Sue attended the wedding, then Mary must have attended the wedding as well.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true, i.e., Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then by the premise, Sue was also at the wedding.\n4. Therefore, if we assume that the premise is true and conclude that Sue was at the wedding, we can logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding as well.\n\nBased on these steps, I would answer:\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct logical form of modus ponens, where the premise and conclusion are both true and the conclusion logically follows from the premise.",
