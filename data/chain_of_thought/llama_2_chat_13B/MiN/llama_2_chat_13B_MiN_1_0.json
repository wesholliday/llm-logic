The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n2. If Mary was not present at the wedding, then it cannot be the case that she must have been there.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
