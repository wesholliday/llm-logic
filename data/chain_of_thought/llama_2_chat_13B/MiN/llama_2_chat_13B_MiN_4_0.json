Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" implies that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that the alien must have visited Mars. In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" based on the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that the alien did visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
