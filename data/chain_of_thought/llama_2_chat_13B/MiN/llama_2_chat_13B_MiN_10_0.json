The sentence \"The dog might not have been inside\" implies that there is a possibility that the dog was not inside, but it does not confirm whether the dog was actually inside or not.\n2. If the dog was not inside, then it is not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside\" based on the fact that the dog might not have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
