Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that the sunglasses must be in her bag. In other words, the absence of the sunglasses in her bag is a possible scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
