The statement \"The pen might not be in my bag\" implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not in my bag.\n2. If the pen is not in my bag, then it must not be the case that the pen is in my bag (i.e., the negation of \"the pen is in my bag\" is true).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" based on the fact that the pen might not be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
