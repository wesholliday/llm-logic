The statement \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n2. If the shoes are not in the closet, then it cannot be the case that they must be in the closet.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" based on the fact that they might not be there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
