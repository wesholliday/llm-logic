Here's my reasoning:\n\nFrom the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\", we can infer that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that the opposite of \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" is true, which is \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\".\n\nSo, based on the given statement, we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
