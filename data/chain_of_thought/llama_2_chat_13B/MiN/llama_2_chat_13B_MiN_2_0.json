Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that the griffin must have been in the forest. In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the griffin was present.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
