Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The vampire might not have been awake\" implies that there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake. This means that we cannot infer with certainty that the vampire must have been awake. In other words, the lack of evidence for the vampire being awake does not necessarily mean that the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
