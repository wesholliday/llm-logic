We are also given the sentence \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. To infer \"The sprocket was cranked,\" we need to assume that the sprocket was cranked and see if it leads to the conclusion that the sprocket was daggled.\n4. If the sprocket was cranked, then it was likely turned or rotated in some way.\n5. Being turned or rotated would likely cause the sprocket to become daggled (i.e., bent or twisted).\n6. Therefore, if the sprocket was cranked, it is likely that it was also daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
