If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked.\n\nI need to determine if we can infer that the splat was morphed based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's analyze statement 1: The splat was quanked. This statement tells us that the splat underwent some kind of action or process called \"quanking.\" However, it doesn't provide any information about the nature of this action or whether the splat was changed in any way.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked. This statement tells us that if the splat was morphed (i.e., changed in some way), then it was also quanked. This implies that there is a relationship between being morphed and being quanked.\n\nSo, can we infer that the splat was morphed based on these two statements? Well, if we assume that the splat was quanked (as stated in statement 1), then we can logically conclude that the splat must have been morphed, because according to statement 2, if the splat was morphed, then it was quanked.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
