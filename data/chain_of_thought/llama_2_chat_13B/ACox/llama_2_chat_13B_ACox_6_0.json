We know that \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (i.e., the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (i.e., the grommet plopping the frink) will also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"The grommet plopped the frink.\" This statement tells us that the grommet did indeed plop the frink, which means that the condition of the grommet being sploffed must have been true.\n3. Based on the conditional statement we established in step 1, if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. Since we know that the grommet did plop the frink, we can infer that the grommet was indeed sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
