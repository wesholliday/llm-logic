A conditional statement has two parts: the if-clause and the then-clause.\n3. The if-clause is \"If the whiffle was shanked\".\n4. The then-clause is \"then the whiffle was tinked\".\n5. In order for the conditional statement to be true, both parts must be true.\n6. Therefore, if the whiffle was shanked, it must have also been tinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
