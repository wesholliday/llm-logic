We know that \"The grommet was plopped\" is true (based on the premise).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped\" is true.\n4. Since \"The grommet was sploffed\" is the negation of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped\", we can infer that \"The grommet was sploffed\" is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
