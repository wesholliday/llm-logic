To infer \"The flugel was blimmed,\" we need to assume that the condition in the if-clause (i.e., \"the flugel was blimmed\") is true.\n4. If the condition in the if-clause is true, then the conclusion of the if-clause (i.e., \"the flugel was zargled\") must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was blimmed\" based on the two given sentences.\n\nAnswer: yes",
