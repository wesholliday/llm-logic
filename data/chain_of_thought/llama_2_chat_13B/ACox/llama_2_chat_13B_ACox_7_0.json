To infer 'The whiffle was shanked', we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n3. Let's assume that the whiffle was not shanked (i.e., the antecedent of the conditional is false). Then, we know that the whiffle did not tink. However, we are also given that the whiffle tinked, which means that the assumption that the whiffle was not shanked must be false.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle was shanked, since the only possible explanation for the whiffle tinking is that it was shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
