The second premise is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n3. From this premise, we can infer that if the flug was blummed, then it would be zimmed.\n4. Therefore, if the flug was zimmed, it must have been blummed first.\n5. Since we know that \"The flug was zimmed,\" we can conclude that the flug was blummed first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
