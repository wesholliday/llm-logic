This means that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be any other type of book.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means that there is no guarantee that the book must be a mystery novel, even if it was written by James.\n3. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James. This follows logically from the second premise, since if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James (according to the first premise).\n\nNow, let me think... Yes, I believe this argument is logically valid! The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
