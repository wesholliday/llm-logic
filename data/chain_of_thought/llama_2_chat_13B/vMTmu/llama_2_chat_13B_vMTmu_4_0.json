This means that if the alien did visit Mars, then it is certain that the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that it is possible for the robot to have visited Jupiter, but it is also possible for the robot not to have visited Jupiter.\n3. Based on these two premises, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars. This is because if the alien had visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, but since the robot did not visit Jupiter, it is certain that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: no",
