            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana would have the property of being yellow.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that the banana does not have the property of being yellow, even if the apple was red.\n3. The conclusion is that the apple was not red. This follows logically from the first two premises, because if the apple was red and the banana did not have the property of being yellow, then the statement \"the apple was red\" must be false.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
