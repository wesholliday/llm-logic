This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that even if Mary was at the wedding, it's not necessarily true that Sue was also there.\n\nThe conclusion is that Mary was not at the wedding. This follows logically from the second premise, since if Sue did not attend the wedding, then Mary could not have attended either (by the first premise).\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
