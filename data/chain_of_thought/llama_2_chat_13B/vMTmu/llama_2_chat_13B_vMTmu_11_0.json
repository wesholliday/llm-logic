This means that if the cake had been chocolate, it would have been impossible for the muffins to not be blueberry.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that it is possible for the muffins to not be blueberry, even if the cake was chocolate.\n3. Based on these two premises, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate. This is because if the cake had been chocolate, it would have been impossible for the muffins to not be blueberry, but since it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, it follows that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nNow, here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
