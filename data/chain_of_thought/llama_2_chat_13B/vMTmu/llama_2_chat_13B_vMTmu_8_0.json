This means that if the vampire was awake, it is necessary that the mummy was also awake.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that it is not necessary that the mummy was awake, even if the vampire was awake.\n3. The conclusion states that the vampire was not awake. This follows logically from the second premise, since if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire could not have been awake either (by the first premise).\n\nNow, let me think... Yes, I see why this argument is logically valid! Here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
