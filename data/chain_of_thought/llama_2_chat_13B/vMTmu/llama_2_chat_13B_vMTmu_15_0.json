This means that if Sam did take a plane, then it is necessary that Erin took a train.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that it is not necessary that Erin took a train, even if Sam did take a plane.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane. However, if we assume that Sam did take a plane, then it would be necessary that Erin took a train, which is not the case according to the second premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
