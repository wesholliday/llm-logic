This means that if Alex crossed the finish line, then Chris must have also crossed the finish line.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that even if Alex finished the race, it's not necessarily true that Chris did as well.\n\nThe conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race. This follows logically from the first two premises, because if Alex did finish the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well (by the first premise), but we know that this is not the case (by the second premise).\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
