This means that if Jeff played basketball, it is necessary that Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This means that it is not necessary that Amy played tennis, even if Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball. However, if we assume that Jeff did play basketball, then according to the first premise, Amy must have played tennis.
