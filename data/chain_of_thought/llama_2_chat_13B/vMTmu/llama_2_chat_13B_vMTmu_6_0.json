This is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is met.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This is a negative statement, which means that it is not true that Bob must have chosen pasta, regardless of what Sue chose.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sue did not choose pizza. This conclusion logically follows from the first two premises, because if Bob must have chosen pasta (as the first premise states), and it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (as the second premise states), then it must be the case that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
