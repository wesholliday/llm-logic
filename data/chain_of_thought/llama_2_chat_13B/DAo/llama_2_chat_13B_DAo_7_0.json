If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies. If Alex had finished the race, then it would mean that Chris also finished the race, since \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a logical statement.\n\nHowever, we know that Alex did not finish the race, so it follows that Chris did not finish the race either. This is because if one of the conditions in the \"if-then\" statement is false (Alex did not finish the race), then the entire statement is false and the conclusion cannot be drawn.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
