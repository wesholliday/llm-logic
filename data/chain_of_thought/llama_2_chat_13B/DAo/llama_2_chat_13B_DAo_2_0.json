If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies. If the griffin was not in the forest, then it is not possible for the unicorn to be in the forest, because the premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
