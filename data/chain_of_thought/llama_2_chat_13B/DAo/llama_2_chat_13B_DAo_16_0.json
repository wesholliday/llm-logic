Let's call this material \"X.\"\n\nNow, consider the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This statement is saying that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim.\n\nSo, if we assume that the shirt was cotton, we can infer that the pants are denim. But since we know that the shirt was not cotton, we can also infer that the pants are not denim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
