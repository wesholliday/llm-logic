            "content": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. We know that Mary was not at the wedding, so we can start by writing this down as a premise:\n\nPremise 1: Mary was not at the wedding\n2. Now, let's consider the second sentence: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This sentence is saying that if Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too. So, we can rewrite this sentence as a conditional statement:\n\nPremise 2: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n3. Now, let's think about what we know so far. We know that Mary was not at the wedding (premise 1), and we also know that if Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too (premise 2). Can we use this information to infer something about Sue's attendance at the wedding?\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nBased on the information we have, we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding. This is because if Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too (according to premise 2), but since Mary was not at the wedding (premise 1), it follows that Sue was not at the wedding either.",
