The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part of the sentence (Sam taking a plane) is false, then the second part of the sentence (Erin taking a train) must be true.\n3. Since we know that Sam did not take a plane, it follows that Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
