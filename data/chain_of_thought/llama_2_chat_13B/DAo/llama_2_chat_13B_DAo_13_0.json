If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nI need to determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the car was red. In this case, the second statement tells us that the truck would be blue. However, since the car was not red, we know that the truck cannot be blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue based on the two statements given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
