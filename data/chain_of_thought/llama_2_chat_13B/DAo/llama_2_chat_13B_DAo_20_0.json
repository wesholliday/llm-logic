This is a straightforward inference based on the meaning of the sentence.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" If we assume that the apple was red (which we know to be false), then we can infer that the banana would be yellow. However, since we have already established that the apple was not red, this implies that the banana is not yellow.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
