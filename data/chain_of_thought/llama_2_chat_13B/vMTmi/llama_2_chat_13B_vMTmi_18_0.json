            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This means that if the doll was made of plastic, it is not possible for the truck to be made of anything other than metal.\n2. The second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This means that there is a possibility that the truck was not made of metal, even if the doll was plastic.\n3. Based on these two premises, we can logically conclude that the doll was not plastic. This is because if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal, but since the truck might not have been metal, it is not possible for the doll to be plastic.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
