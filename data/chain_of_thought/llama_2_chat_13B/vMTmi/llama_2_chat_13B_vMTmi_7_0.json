This means that if Alex crossed the finish line, then Chris also crossed the finish line.\n\nThe second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is a possibility that Chris did not cross the finish line.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"Alex did not finish the race.\" If we assume that Chris did not finish the race (which is allowed by the second premise), then we can logically deduce that Alex did not finish the race, since if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical sequence of reasoning based on the given premises. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
