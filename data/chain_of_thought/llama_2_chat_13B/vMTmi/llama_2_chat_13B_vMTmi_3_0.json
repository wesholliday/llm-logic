This means that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be any other type of book.\n2. The second premise states that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, even if it was written by James.\n3. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James. This is based on the fact that the book might not be a mystery novel, and therefore cannot have been written by James if it is not a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let me think... Yes, I see why this argument is logically valid! Here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
