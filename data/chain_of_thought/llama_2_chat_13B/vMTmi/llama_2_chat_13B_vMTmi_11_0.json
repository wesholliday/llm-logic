This means that if the cake had been chocolate, it would have been impossible for the muffins not to be blueberry.\n2. The second premise states that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry, even if the cake was chocolate.\n3. Based on the first two premises, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate. This is because if the cake had been chocolate, it would have been impossible for the muffins not to be blueberry, but since the muffins might not have been blueberry, it follows that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is logically valid, as it follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
