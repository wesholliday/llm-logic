            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not attend the wedding, even if Mary did.\n\nThe conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. This is logically deduced from the fact that Sue might not have been at the wedding, and if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been there either.\n\nSo, based on the given premises, the conclusion logically follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
