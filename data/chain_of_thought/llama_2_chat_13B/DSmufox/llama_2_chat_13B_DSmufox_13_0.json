We know that \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This means that there is no requirement for the glip to be tragged.\n2. We also know that \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged, then it is slogged.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged' together with 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged', can we infer 'The glip is slogged'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
