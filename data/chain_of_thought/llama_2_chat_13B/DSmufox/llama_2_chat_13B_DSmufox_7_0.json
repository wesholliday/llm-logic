We know that \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\" This means that it is not necessary for the whiffle to be tinked.\n2. We also know that \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\" This means that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
