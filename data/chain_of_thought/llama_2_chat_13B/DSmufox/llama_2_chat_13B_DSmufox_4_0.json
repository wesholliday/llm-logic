We know that \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This means that it is possible for the fribble to exist without being crinked.\n2. We also know that \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\" This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the fribble is not crinked, then it is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
