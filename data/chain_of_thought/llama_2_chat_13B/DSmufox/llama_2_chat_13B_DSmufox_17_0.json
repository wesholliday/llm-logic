We know that \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\" This means that there is no requirement for the flob to be movated.\n2. We also know that \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This means that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
