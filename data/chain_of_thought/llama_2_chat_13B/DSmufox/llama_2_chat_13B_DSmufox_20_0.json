We know that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that it is not necessary for the fleeg to be surned.\n2. We also know that \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This means that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the fleeg is not surned, then it is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
