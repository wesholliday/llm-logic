From this statement, we can infer that there is no requirement for the dreb to be spened.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed\".\n4. If the dreb is not required to be spened (as we just inferred), then the only other option is that it is vroombed.\n5. Therefore, based on the two statements together, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
