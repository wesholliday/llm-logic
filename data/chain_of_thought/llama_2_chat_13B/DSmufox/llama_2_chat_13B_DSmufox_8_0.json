The statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" means that it is possible for the sprocket to be in a state other than being daggled.\n2. The statement \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n3. If the sprocket is not daggled and it is not cranked, then it must be in some other state (i.e., it is not either daggled or cranked).\n4. However, we have already established that the sprocket cannot be in a state other than being daggled or cranked, so this third possibility does not exist.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
