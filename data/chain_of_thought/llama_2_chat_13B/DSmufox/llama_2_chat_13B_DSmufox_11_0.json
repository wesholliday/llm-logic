From this statement, we can infer that there is no requirement for the flug to be zimmed. In other words, it is possible for the flug to exist without being zimmed.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\". This statement implies that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n4. Based on the previous two statements, we can conclude that if the flug is not zimmed, then it is blummed. In other words, there is no possibility for the flug to exist without being either zimmed or blummed.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
