From this, we can infer that there is no requirement for the flugel to be zargled.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\".\n4. If the flugel is not zargled (which we have just established), then it must be blimmed.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
