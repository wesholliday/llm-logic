The statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" means that it is not necessary for the grommet to be plopped.\n2. The statement \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\" means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n3. If the grommet is not plopped and it is not sploffed, then it must be something else (i.e., neither plopped nor sploffed).\n4. However, we know that the grommet is not plopped, so the only remaining option is that it is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
