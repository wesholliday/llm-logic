This means that the splat can be in any state it wants, including being morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This premise tells us that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. Since we have already established that there is no requirement for the splat to be quanked, we can infer that the splat is indeed morphed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
