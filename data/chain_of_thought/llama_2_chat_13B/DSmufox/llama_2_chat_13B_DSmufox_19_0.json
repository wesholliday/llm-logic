We know that \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\" This means that it is possible for the smonk to exist without being plagued.\n2. We also know that \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\" This means that if the smonk is not plagued, then it must be vreebled.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the smonk is not plagued, then it is vreebled. In other words, if \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\" and \"Either the smonk must be plagued or it is vreebled,\" then we can conclude that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Answer: yes. The smonk is vreebled.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
