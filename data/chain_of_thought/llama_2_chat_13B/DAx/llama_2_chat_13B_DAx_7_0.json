The whiffle was not shanked.\n\nSo, if we assume that the whiffle was not shanked, can we infer that it did not tink? Let me think about this for a moment...\n\nHmmm... I'm having a bit of trouble with this one. If the whiffle was not shanked, then it must have been something else that caused it to tink. Maybe there was another object or force that caused the whiffle to make a sound?\n\nWait a minute, I think I've got it! If the whiffle was not shanked, then it must have been something else that caused it to tink. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: no",
