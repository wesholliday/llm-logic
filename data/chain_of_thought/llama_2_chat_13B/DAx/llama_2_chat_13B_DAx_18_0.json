The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" implies that if the shank was plooked (whatever that means), then it must have been nugged as well.\n2. We are also given the information \"The shank was not plooked\".\n3. Therefore, based on the first statement, if the shank was not plooked, then it cannot be nugged.\n4. So, we can infer that \"The shank was not nugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
