The sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" implies that if the clug was in a state of being fleeked (whatever that means), then it must also be in a state of being snugged.\n2. The sentence \"The clug was not fleeked\" tells us that the clug is not in a state of being fleeked.\n3. Based on the first sentence, if the clug is not fleeked, then it must not be snugged either.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: no",
