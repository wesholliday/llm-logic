Here we go!\n\nSo, the two statements given are:\n\n1. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n2. \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nOkay, let's think about what these statements mean. Statement 1 says that if the sneg (whatever that is) was crampled (presumably meaning compressed or squashed), then it would have sproted (spouted? I'm not sure what this word means either) the frink (whatever that is).\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"The sneg was not crampled.\" This means that the sneg was not compressed or squashed.\n\nSo, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that the sneg did not sprot the frink. Why? Because if the sneg had been crampled, it would have sproted the frink, but since the sneg was not crampled, it did not sprot the frink.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
