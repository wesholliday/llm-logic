This is given in the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nWe also know that Chris finished the race. This is given in the statement \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well. This is because if Chris finished the race, then it means that Alex did finish the race, since the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
