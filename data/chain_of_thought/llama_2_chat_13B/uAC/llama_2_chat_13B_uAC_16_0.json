            "content": "Okay! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The question states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim.\n2. The second part of the question states that the pants were denim. This means that the pants are definitely made of denim, regardless of what the shirt is made of.\n3. Based on the information provided, we can infer that the shirt is not made of denim, because if it was, then the pants would also be made of denim (according to the first part of the question).\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the shirt is made of cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
