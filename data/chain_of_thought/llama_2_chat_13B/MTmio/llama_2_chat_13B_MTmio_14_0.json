We know that \"the wolf might not have been in the den.\" This means that it is possible for the wolf to be in the den, but we don't know for sure.\n2. We also know that \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would definitely be in the den.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf might not have been in the den.\n4. Therefore, if we assume that the bear was not in the cave, we can conclude that the wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
