If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n3. So, if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy would have played tennis.\n4. But we were told that Amy might not have played tennis, so it's possible that she didn't play tennis even if Jeff did play basketball.\n5. Therefore, we can't infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
