If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (this is the given information).\n3. Therefore, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n4. However, we were told that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, so it's possible that he didn't buy it even if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
