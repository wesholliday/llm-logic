If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (this is the given information).\n3. Therefore, if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, based on the information we have, it is not possible for Sam to have taken a plane and Erin to have taken a train, since they are mutually exclusive options. So, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
