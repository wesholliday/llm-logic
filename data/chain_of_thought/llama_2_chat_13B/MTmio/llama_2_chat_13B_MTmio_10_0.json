If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (this is a logical consequence of the premise).\n3. Therefore, if the cat might not have been outside, then the dog must not have been inside (this follows logically from the previous two points).\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
