If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nNow, let's assume that the statement \"The mummy might not have been awake\" is true. This means that the mummy could have been asleep or unconscious.\n\nIf the mummy was asleep or unconscious, then it would not be possible for the vampire to have been awake, because the mummy's state of being asleep or unconscious would have prevented the vampire from being able to interact with it.\n\nTherefore, if the mummy might not have been awake, and if the vampire was awake, then it must be the case that the mummy was not awake. This leads us to the conclusion:\n\nAnswer: yes",
