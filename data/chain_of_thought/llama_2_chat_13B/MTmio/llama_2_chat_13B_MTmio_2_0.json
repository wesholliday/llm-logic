The statement \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" means that it is possible for the unicorn not to be in the forest, but we don't know for sure.\n2. The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" means that if the griffin was in the forest, then it is certain that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n3. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
