If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (given the information we have).\n3. Therefore, if Sue chose pizza, it would mean that Bob did choose pasta.\n4. However, we were told that Bob might not have chosen pasta, so it's possible that he didn't choose it even if Sue did choose pizza.\n\nBased on these steps, can we infer that Sue did not choose pizza?\n\nAnswer: no",
