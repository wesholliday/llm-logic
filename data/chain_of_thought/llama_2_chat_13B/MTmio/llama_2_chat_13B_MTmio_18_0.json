Let's assume that the doll was not plastic.\n\nIf the doll was not plastic, then the statement \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is false. In other words, if the doll was not plastic, then it is not true that the truck must have been metal.\n\nHowever, we also know that \"the truck might not have been metal\". This means that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal, even if the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. We can only conclude that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal, regardless of whether the doll was plastic or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
