This means that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nNow, let's combine these two sentences: \"The wug might not be bimmed\" and \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped\". We can infer that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
