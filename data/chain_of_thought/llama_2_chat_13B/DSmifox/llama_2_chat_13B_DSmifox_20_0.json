The statement \"The fleeg might not be surned\" implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned, but it does not necessarily mean that it is bluttered.\n2. The statement \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" means that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n3.
