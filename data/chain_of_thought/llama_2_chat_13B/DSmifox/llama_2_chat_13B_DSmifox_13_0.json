From this statement, we can infer that the glip is either tragged or it is not tragged (i.e., it might not be tragged).\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\"\n4. If the glip is tragged, then it cannot be slogged (since these two states are mutually exclusive).\n5. Therefore, if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n6. Based on the above reasoning, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
