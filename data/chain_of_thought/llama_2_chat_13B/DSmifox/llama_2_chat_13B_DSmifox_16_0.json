The sentence \"The sneg might not be sproted\" implies that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n2. If the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled, because the sentence \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\" states that one of these two things must be true.\n3.
