This is a straightforward inference based on the meaning of the words.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\" This premise tells us that the smonk is either plagged or vreebled. If the smonk is not plagged (which we have already inferred), then it must be vreebled.\n\nSo, based on our reasoning, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
