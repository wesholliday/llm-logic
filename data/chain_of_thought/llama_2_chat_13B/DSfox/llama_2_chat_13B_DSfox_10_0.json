This sentence tells us that the wug is either in a state of being garpled or it is in a state of being sproinged.\n\nSince we know that the wug is not garpled, we can conclude that the wug must be in a state of being sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'The wug is not garpled' together with 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged', can we infer 'The wug is sproinged'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
