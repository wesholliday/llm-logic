This statement tells us that the sprocket is either in a state of being daggled or it is in a state of being cranked.\n\nSince we have already established that the sprocket is not daggled, we can conclude that it must be in a state of being cranked.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'The sprocket is not daggled' together with 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked', can we infer 'The sprocket is cranked'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
