This is a straightforward inference, as the statement explicitly states that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\". This statement presents two possibilities: either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed. Since we have already established that the flugel is not zargled, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements \"The flugel is not zargled\" and \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\", we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
