If the dreb is spent, then it cannot be vroomed, because once something is spent, it cannot be vroomed.\n2. If the dreb is not spent, then it must be vroomed, because the second statement says that either the dreb is spent or it is vroomed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the dreb is vroomed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
