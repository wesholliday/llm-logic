This statement implies that there are only two possible states for the smip: lupped and shripped.\n\nIf the smip is not lupped, then it must be in the state of being shripped, since there are no other options.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
