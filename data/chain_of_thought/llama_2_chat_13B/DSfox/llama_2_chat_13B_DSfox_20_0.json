This statement implies that if the fleeg had a surname, it would be either surned (i.e., have a surname) or bluttered (i.e., not have a surname).\n\nSince we know that the fleeg does not have a surname (from the first statement), we can conclude that it is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
