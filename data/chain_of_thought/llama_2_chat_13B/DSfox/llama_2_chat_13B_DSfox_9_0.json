This is a straightforward inference based on the meaning of the words \"plinked\" and \"not.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\" This premise tells us that there are only two possible states for the twonk: it is either plinked or it is varnished.\n\nGiven that we have already established that the twonk is not plinked, we can conclude that the twonk must be varnished. This conclusion follows logically from the premises, as there is no other possible state for the twonk besides being plinked or varnished.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
