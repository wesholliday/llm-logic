The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" implies that the remote control is either in one of these two locations or it is not present at all.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that the remote control is not under the couch.\n3. Therefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the remote control is only left with one possible location - on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
