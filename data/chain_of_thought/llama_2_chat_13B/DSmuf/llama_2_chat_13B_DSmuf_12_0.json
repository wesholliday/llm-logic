The statement \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" implies that one of these two possibilities must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" means that the first possibility (the jacket being hung in the closet) is not true.\n3.
