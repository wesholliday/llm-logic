The statement \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\" means that one of two possibilities is true: either the pen is on my desk, or it is in my bag.\n2. The statement \"The pen might not be on my desk\" means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk.\n3. If the pen might not be on my desk, then it must be in my bag, because that is the only other possible location for the pen.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
