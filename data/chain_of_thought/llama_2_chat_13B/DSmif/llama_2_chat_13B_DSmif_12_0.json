The statement \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" implies that the jacket cannot be both hanging in the closet and draped over the chair at the same time.\n2. We are also given that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n3. If the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair, since there is no other option left.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
