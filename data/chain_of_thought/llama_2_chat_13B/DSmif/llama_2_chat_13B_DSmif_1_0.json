This means that there are only two possible locations for Fido: the garden or inside the house.\n2. We also know that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but we don't know where he is.\n3. If Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside. This is because there are only two possible locations for Fido, and if he's not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n4. Therefore, based on the information we have, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
