            "content": "Okay, let me think this through step by step.\n\nSo, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. But we also know that the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, we can conclude that the shirt was not denim.\n\nWait a minute... if the shirt was not denim, then it must be something else. Like... polyester? No, that's not it either. Ah ha! The shirt must be silk!\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense. Silk is a material that is typically worn by women. And we know that the person who wore this outfit was a man. So, the shirt cannot be silk.\n\nHmmm... I'm stuck. I can't figure it out. Oh wait, I have it! The shirt must be linen! Yes, that's it! Linen is a material that is lightweight and breathable, just like the shirt we're describing. And it's not cotton or denim, so it must be linen.\n\nNow, let me think about the pants... if the shirt was linen, then the pants were probably made of a lightweight material as well. But we know that the pants were not denim. So, they must be... polyester! Yes, that's it! The pants are polyester.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
