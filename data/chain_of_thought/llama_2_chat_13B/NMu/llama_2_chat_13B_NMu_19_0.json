Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the watch to be charging on the dresser. This means that the watch could potentially be charging somewhere else, or it might not be charging at all.\n\nSince we know that the watch is not necessarily charging on the dresser, it's possible that it might not be charging anywhere else either. Therefore, we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
