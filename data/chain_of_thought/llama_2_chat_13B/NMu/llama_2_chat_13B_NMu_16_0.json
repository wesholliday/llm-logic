The statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" implies that there is a possibility that the pen might not be in my bag.\n2. If the pen must be in my bag, then it would be certain that the pen is in my bag. But since we know that this is not the case, it means that there is a possibility that the pen might not be in my bag.\n3. Therefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the pen might not be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
