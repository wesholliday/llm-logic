Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" means that there is no possibility that Jeff had to play basketball. This implies that Jeff had a choice about whether or not to play basketball, and he chose not to.\n\nIf Jeff had a choice about playing basketball, then it's possible that he didn't play basketball. In other words, the fact that Jeff didn't have to play basketball means that he might not have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff might not have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
