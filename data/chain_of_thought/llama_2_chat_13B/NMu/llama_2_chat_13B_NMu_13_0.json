The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means that there is no requirement or obligation for the toy to be in the toy box.\n2. If there is no requirement for the toy to be in the toy box, then it is possible for the toy to not be in the toy box.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
