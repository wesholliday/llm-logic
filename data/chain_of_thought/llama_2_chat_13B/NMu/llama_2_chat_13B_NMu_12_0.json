Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" means that there is no requirement or obligation for the jacket to be draped over the chair. This implies that the jacket could potentially be in a different location or state, such as being worn by someone or hanging on a hook.\n\nSince we know that the jacket is not required to be draped over the chair, it is possible that it might not be draped over the chair. In other words, the absence of a requirement for the jacket to be draped over the chair means that there is no guarantee that it will be in that location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
