Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" means that there is no possibility that Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then it would be the case that she must have been there. But since it's not the case that she must have been there, it follows that she was not at the wedding.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
