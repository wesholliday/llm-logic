Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that there is no possibility that Sue chose pizza. This implies that there are other possibilities for what Sue might have chosen. In other words, since we know that Sue did not choose pizza, it's possible that she chose something else.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza. This inference is based on the fact that there are other possibilities for what Sue might have chosen, and we know that she did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
