Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" means that there is no necessity or requirement for the book to have been written by James. This implies that it is possible for the book to have been written by someone else, or even by multiple people.\n\nFurthermore, if we assume that the book was not written by James, then it is likely that the book might have been written by someone else. This is because there are many other potential authors who could have written the book, and we have no information to suggest that any of them did not write it.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
