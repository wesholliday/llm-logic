Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" means that there is no possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt. This is because the word \"must\" implies a certainty or necessity that is not present in this situation.\n\nIf Lisa did not must have bought the red shirt, then it is possible that she might not have bought it. In other words, the absence of the word \"must\" implies the possibility of the opposite outcome (i.e., that Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
