The statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" means that there is no necessity or requirement for the alien to have visited Mars.\n2. This implies that the possibility of the alien visiting Mars is open, and there is no evidence to suggest that it did or did not happen.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the alien might have visited Mars, but we cannot say for certain whether it did or did not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
