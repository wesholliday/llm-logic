We also know that 'The pants were denim' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim.\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was actually cotton. It only means that if it was cotton, then the pants would be denim.\n5. So, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton based solely on the fact that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
