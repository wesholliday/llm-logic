We know that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true (this is given in the premise).\n2. We also know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true (this is given in the premise).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true.\n4. Logically, if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by someone.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
