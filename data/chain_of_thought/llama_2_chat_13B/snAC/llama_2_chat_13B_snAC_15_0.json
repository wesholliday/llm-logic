This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nSecond, we know that 'Erin took a train' is true. This means that Erin did take a train.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies for Sam. If Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. But we already know that Erin took a train, so it follows that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that 'Sam took a plane' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
