This means that if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well.\n\nSecond, we know that 'Chris finished the race' is true. This means that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for Alex. If Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well. But we already know that Chris did finish the race, so it follows that Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
