We also know that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' has a true antecedent (the cake being chocolate) and a true consequent (the muffins being blueberry).\n4. Logically, if the antecedent (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequent (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
