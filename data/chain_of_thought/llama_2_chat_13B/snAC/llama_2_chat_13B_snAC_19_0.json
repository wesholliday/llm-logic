This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nSecond, we know that 'Jen watched basketball' is true. This means that Jen did watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical implications of these two statements. If Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. But we already know that Jen did watch basketball, so it follows that Tom must have watched football.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
