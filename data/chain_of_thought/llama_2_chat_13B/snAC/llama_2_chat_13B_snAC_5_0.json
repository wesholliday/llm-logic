This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nSecond, we know that 'Amy played tennis' is true. This means that Amy did play tennis.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies for Jeff. If Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis. But since Amy did play tennis, it must be the case that Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 'Jeff played basketball' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
