            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy must also not be awake.\n2. The second premise states that the vampire was not awake. This means that the mummy cannot be awake either, since the first premise implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake.\n3. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
