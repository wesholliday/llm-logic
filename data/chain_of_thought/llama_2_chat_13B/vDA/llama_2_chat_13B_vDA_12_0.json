This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nThe second premise is \"Joe did not go to the park\". This means that Joe did not go to the park, and therefore, Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nSo, the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
