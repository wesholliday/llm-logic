This means that if the doll had been made of plastic, it would have followed that the truck was made of metal.\n2. The second premise states that the doll was not plastic. This means that the doll was not made of plastic.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the doll was not plastic, then the truck could not have been metal.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the truck was not metal logically follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
