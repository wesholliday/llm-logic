This means that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\n\nThe second premise states that Alex did not finish the race. This means that Alex did not complete the race.\n\nSo, if we assume that Alex did not finish the race, then we can logically conclude that Chris did not finish the race, because if Alex did not finish, then Chris did not finish (by the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
