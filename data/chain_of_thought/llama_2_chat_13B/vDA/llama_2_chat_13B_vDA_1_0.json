            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n\nThe second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding. This is because if Mary did not attend the wedding, then Sue must not have attended the wedding either.\n\nSo, the conclusion logically follows from the two premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
