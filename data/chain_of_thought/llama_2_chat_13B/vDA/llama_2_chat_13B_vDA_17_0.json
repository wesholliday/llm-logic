This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nThe second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta. This means that Ben did not consume any pasta.\n\nSo, based on the two premises, we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad. This is because if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate cannot have eaten salad (since the first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
