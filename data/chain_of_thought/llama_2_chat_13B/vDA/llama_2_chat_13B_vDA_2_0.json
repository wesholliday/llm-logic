            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This means that the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn.\n2. The second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the griffin does not exist in the forest.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This is because the presence of the griffin is a necessary condition for the presence of the unicorn.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the unicorn was not in the forest logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
