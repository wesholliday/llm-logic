            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, it must be the case that Mark purchased the blue shirt.\n\nThe second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that Lisa did not purchase the red shirt.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can logically conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is because if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not possible for Mark to have bought the blue shirt (since the first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
