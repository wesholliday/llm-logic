    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If the vanoon isn't selected, then the jentapp will be selected.\n3. The stribben likely will be chosen, which means the vanoon likely won't be.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the stribben isn't selected:\n\n1. If the stribben isn't selected, then the vanoon is not selected either (based on the owner's preferences).\n2. Since the jentapp is the only remaining applicant, it will be selected to rent the bondle.\n\nTherefore, if the stribben isn't selected, it is likely that the jentapp will be selected to rent the bondle.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
