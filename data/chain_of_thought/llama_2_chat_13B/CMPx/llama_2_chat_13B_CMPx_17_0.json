    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

The flinker has the best projections to have a breakout season next year, and talent scouts believe it's highly probable that the flinker will have a breakout season.\n2. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n3. However, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season, which means it's less likely that the dringen won't have a breakout season.\n4. If the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, then the dringen is unlikely to have a breakout season.\n5. Therefore, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it's less likely that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nNow, based on my reasoning, I will answer:\n\nAnswer: No",
