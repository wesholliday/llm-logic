Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

And if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will.\n\nNow, we are also given that the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most. This means that if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will not bafwidge the most either.\n\nSo, putting all of this together, we can conclude that...\n\nAnswer: No \ud83d\ude0a",
