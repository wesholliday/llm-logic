Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

If the beelhet doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer.\n3. It is likely that the garplex will become domer, and hence the beelhet is unlikely to become domer.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: if the garplex doesn't become domer, is it likely that the peedonk will?\n\nBased on the information provided, we know that if the garplex becomes domer, the beelhet is unlikely to become domer. But if the garplex doesn't become domer, then the beelhet has a higher chance of becoming domer, since it is the only other candidate left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
