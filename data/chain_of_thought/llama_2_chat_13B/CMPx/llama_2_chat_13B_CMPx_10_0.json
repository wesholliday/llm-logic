    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

If the dribban isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be.\n3. The fantole is expected to lead downloads, so it's unlikely that the dribban will be the most downloaded.\n\nNow, let me think about whether it follows that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be...\n\nHmmm... based on the information provided, it seems that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit is likely to be the most downloaded. This is because the dribban is expected to be the second most downloaded, and if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the dribban won't be either. Therefore, the only other option left is the cruggit.\n\nSo, my answer is... yes! If the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it's likely that the cruggit will be.",
