    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

If the lanken doesn't win the award, then the draloid will win it (given that these are the only candidates in contention).\n3. Since the trenist likely will win the award, it is less likely that the lanken will win it.\n4. Therefore, if the trenist doesn't win the award, it is more likely that the draloid will win it.\n\nNow, let me think about this for a moment...\n\nAnswer: Yes",
