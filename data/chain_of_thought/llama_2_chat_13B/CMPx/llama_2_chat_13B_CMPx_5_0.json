    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

If the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then the votal will.\n3. The fraglen likely will lead the league, so the darpil likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\n1. and 2. imply that if the darpil doesn't have the top record, it's likely that the votal will.\n3. suggests that the fraglen is highly likely to lead the league, which means the darpil is unlikely to lead the league.\n\nBased on the information, it seems that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, it's likely that the votal will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
