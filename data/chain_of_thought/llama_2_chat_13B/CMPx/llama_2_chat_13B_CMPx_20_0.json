    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

If the foopet isn't the top seller, then the crangor will be.\n3. Therefore, if the trundle isn't the top seller, it is likely that the crangor will be.\n\nNow, I am ready to answer. Answer: No.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: while the trundle is expected to be the top seller, there is a possibility that the foopet could outsell the trundle. If the foopet does outsell the trundle, then the crangor will not be the top seller, even though it is likely to have significantly lower sales than the trundle and foopet. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that if the trundle isn't the top seller, the crangor will be.",
