The cookies could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\" This statement implies that the cookies must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. If the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (as stated in statement 1), then they must be in the jar.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar. The first statement tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, and the second statement tells us that the cookies must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry, so it follows that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
