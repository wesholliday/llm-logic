Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the book is not on the shelf (i.e., the book is not in either of these locations). This means that the book must be resting on the table, since we know it is not on the shelf.\n\nHowever, we also know that the book isn't resting on the table, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that the book is not on the shelf must be false, and we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
