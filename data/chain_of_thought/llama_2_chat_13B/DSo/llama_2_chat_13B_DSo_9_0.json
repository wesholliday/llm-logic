Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\n\nI want to find out if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box. In this case, statement 2 would be false because the missing puzzle piece would not be either in the box or blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's think about what we know based on statement 1. If the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, then it must be somewhere else. The only other place we know of that could potentially contain the missing puzzle piece is the box. Therefore, if the missing puzzle piece isn't in the box, it must be somewhere else, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box!\n\nAnswer: yes",
