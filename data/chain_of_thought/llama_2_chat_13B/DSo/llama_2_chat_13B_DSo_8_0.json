The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" implies that the remote control must be one of these two places.\n3. Since we already know that the remote control isn't under the couch, the only possible place for it is the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
