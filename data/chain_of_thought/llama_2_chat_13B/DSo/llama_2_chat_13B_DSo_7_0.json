The statement \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet\" means that the umbrella must be either in the car or in the closet, but not both.\n3. If the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
