The statement \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\" implies that the shoes are not in their usual place, which is by the door.\n2. The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door\" means that the shoes must be either in the closet or by the door, there is no other option.\n3. If the shoes are not in the closet (which we know from step 1), then they must be by the door.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are by the door.\n\nAnswer: yes",
