Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n\nI can start by negating statement 1:\n\n1'. The sunglasses are perched on her head.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2 in light of statement 1':\n\n2'. Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are not perched on her head (i.e., they are somewhere else).\n\nSince we know that the sunglasses are not perched on her head (statement 1), we can conclude that they must be in her bag (statement 2'). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
