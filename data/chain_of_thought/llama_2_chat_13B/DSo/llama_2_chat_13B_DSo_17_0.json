The statement \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack\" implies that the scarf is not currently located on the coat rack.\n2. The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the scarf: either it is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n3. If the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack (by the laws of logic).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
