This means that if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's assume that the toy is not sitting on the shelf. This means that it must be in the toy box, since there is no other option. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
