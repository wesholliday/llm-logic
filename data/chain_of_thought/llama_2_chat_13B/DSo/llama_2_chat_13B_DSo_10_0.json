This means that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nSo, let me summarize my reasoning:\n\n1. The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n2. Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n3. If the missing sock isn't under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, I can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
