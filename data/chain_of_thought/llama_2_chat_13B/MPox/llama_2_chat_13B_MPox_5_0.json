This statement tells us that the zinger was in a state of being fragged, but it doesn't necessarily tell us anything about whether it was smoogled or not.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\". This statement tells us that if the zinger was in a state of being fragged, then it must also be smoogled. In other words, if the zinger was fraggled, then it is guaranteed to be smoogled.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled. This means that we can conclude that the zinger was smoogled, given that it was fraggled.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
