We are also given the premise \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n3. To infer \"The glip was tragged,\" we need to assume that the glip was slogged and then apply the premise.\n4. If the glip was slogged, then it must have been tragged, because the premise states that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged.\n5. Therefore, we can infer \"The glip was tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
