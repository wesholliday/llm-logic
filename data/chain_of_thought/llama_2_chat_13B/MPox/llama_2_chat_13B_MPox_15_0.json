We are also given the premise \"If the dreb was vroomed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n3. To infer \"The dreb was spened,\" we need to determine if the dreb was vroomed.\n4. Based on the first sentence, we know that the dreb was vroomed (since \"vroomed\" is a past tense verb form).\n5. Therefore, by modus ponens (a logical rule of inference), we can conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
