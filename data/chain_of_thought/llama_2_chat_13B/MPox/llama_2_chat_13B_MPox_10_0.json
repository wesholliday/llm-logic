We know that \"The wug was sproinged.\" This is a statement about the past tense of the verb \"sproing.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between being sproinged and being garpled.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This is because the conditional statement tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"It was garpled.\" This is our final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
