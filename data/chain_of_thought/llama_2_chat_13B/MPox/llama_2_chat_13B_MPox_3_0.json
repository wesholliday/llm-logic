If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nI need to determine if we can infer that the splat quanked based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1: The splat was morphed. This means that the splat underwent some kind of transformation or change. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the splat quanked.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked. This statement implies that there is a causal relationship between being morphed and quanking. In other words, if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the splat quanked. The first statement tells us that the splat was morphed, and the second statement tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the splat quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
