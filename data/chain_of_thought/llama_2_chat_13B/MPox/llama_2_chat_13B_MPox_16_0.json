We are also given the premise \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n3. To infer \"The sneg sproted the frink,\" we need to assume that the sneg was indeed crampled and see if it logically follows that the sneg sproted the frink.\n4. Based on the given premise, if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink.\n5. Therefore, we can infer \"The sneg sproted the frink\" based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
