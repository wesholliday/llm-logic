We are also given the conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n3. To infer whether the grommet plopped the frink, we need to determine if the grommet was sploffed.\n4. Based on the first sentence, we know that the grommet was sploffed.\n5. Therefore, by the conditional statement, we can infer that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
