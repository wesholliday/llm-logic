We are also given the sentence \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n3. From this second sentence, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have turned or changed into something else (since \"surned\" is a verb form of \"turn\").\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
