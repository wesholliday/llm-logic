The conditional statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. To infer the conclusion, we need to assume that the premise is true and see if the conditional statement leads us to the conclusion.\n4. If the sprocket was cranked (premise), then it was daggled (conditional statement).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
