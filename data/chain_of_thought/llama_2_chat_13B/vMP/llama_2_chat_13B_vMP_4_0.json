This means that if the alien went to Mars, it must have also gone to Jupiter.\n2. The second premise states that the alien visited Mars. This means that the alien did go to Mars.\n3. Therefore, based on the first premise, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n4. Since the alien did visit Mars, it must have also visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
