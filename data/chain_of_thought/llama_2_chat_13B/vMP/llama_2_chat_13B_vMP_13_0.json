This is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequences.\n2. The second premise states that the car was red. This is a simple statement of fact.\n3. If we assume that the first premise is true (i.e., if the car was red), then we can logically conclude that the truck was blue, based on the conditional statement in the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is that the truck was blue.\n\nNow, let me answer the question:\n\nAnswer: yes",
