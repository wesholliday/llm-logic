This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then it is certain that Sue also attended the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that Mary was at the wedding. This means that Mary did attend the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
