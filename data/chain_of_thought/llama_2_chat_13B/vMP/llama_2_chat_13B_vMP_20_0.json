            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This means that there is a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n2. The second premise states that the apple was red. This provides evidence for the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n3. Based on the first two premises, we can conclude that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.
