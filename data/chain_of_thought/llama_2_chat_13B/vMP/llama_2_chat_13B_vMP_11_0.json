This means that there is a conditional relationship between the cake and the muffins.\n2. The second premise states that the cake was chocolate. This provides evidence for the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n3. Based on the first two premises, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let me think about whether this argument is logically valid...\n\nYes, I have determined that the argument is logically valid! Here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
