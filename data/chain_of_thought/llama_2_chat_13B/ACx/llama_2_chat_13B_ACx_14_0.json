The sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (i.e., \"the clug was fleeked\") is true, then the conclusion (i.e., \"the clug snugged\") must also be true.\n3. Therefore, if we know that \"the clug snugged\" is true, we can infer that \"the clug was fleeked\" must also be true.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
