We know that \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This means that if the zinger was in a state of being fraggled, then it must also be in a state of being smoogled.\n2. We also know that \"The zinger was smoogled.\" This means that the zinger is currently in a state of being smoogled.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the zinger is in a state of being smoogled, then it must have been fraggled at some point in the past.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
