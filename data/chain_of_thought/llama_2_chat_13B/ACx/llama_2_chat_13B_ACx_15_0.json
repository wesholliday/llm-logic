I understand the given statements as follows:\n\t* \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" (conditional statement)\n\t* \"The dreb was spened\" (statement)\n2. To infer 'The dreb was vroomed', we need to determine if the conditional statement is true based on the given statements.\n3. The conditional statement states that if the dreb was vroomed, then it was spended.\n4. We know from the second statement that the dreb was spended.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was vroomed, since the condition in the conditional statement is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
