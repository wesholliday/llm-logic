The premise is given as \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This means that if the whiffle was hit in a certain way (i.e., shanked), it will produce a specific sound (i.e., tinked).\n2. The second premise is \"The whiffle tinked.\" This tells us that the whiffle did, in fact, produce the expected sound.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have produced the sound of tinked. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
