We know that \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This means that if the fribble was subjected to the action of snurgling, then it will have the effect of crinkling.\n2. We also know that \"The fribble crinked.\" This tells us that the fribble has been subjected to some kind of action that has caused it to become crinkled.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinkled. Since we know that the fribble has crinkled, we can infer that it must have been snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
