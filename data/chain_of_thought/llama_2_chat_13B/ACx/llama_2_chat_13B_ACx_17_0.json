(This is the second given premise.)\n3. Therefore, the flob was skizzled. (This is the conclusion we want to draw.)\n\nNow, let me think about whether this conclusion logically follows from the premises...\n\nHmmm... I see that the first premise states that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated. And the second premise states that the flob did move. So, if we combine these two premises, we can infer that the flob was skizzled!\n\nAnswer: yes",
