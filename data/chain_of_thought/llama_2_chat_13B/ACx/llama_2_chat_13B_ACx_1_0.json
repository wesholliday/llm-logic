We know that \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This means that if the flugel was blimmed (i.e., something happened to it), then it must have been zargled (i.e., it underwent some kind of process).\n2. We also know that \"The flugel was zargled.\" This tells us that the flugel did undergo some kind of process.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that the flugel must have been blimmed (i.e., something happened to it) because it was zargled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
