We know that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked (whatever that means), then it must have been varnished.\n2. We also know that \"The twonk was varnished.\" This tells us that the twonk has been varnished at some point in time.\n3. So, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that the twonk must have been plinked at some point in time as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
