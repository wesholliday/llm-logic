To infer 'The sprocket was cranked', we need to assume that the first premise is true and see if it logically follows from the second premise.\n3. If the sprocket was daggled, then it must have been cranked at some point, since being daggled is a state that can only be achieved by cranking.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sprocket was cranked' based on the fact that it was daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
