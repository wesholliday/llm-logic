The first sentence is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This means that if the wug was in a state of being flooped, then it must have bimmied the zoint.\n2. The second sentence is \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\" This tells us that the wug did, in fact, bim the zoint.\n3. Based on the two sentences, we can infer that the wug was flooped because if it had not been flooped, it would not have been able to bim the zoint.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
