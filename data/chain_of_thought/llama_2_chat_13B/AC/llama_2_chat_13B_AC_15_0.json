The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would take a train.\n3. Therefore, if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train.\n4. We know that Erin did take a train, so we can infer that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
