We know that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest.\n2. We are also given that \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn is definitely present in the forest.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the unicorn is present in the forest, then the griffin must also be present in the forest.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
