We know that Kate ate the salad, so let's assume that she ate it after Ben ate his pasta (we don't know the order in which they ate their meals).\n2. If Ben ate pasta, then he must have eaten something, since we know that Kate ate the salad.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did eat pasta, since he must have eaten something and we know that Kate ate the salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
