Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that:\n\n3. Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nWhy? Because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt (based on statement 1). And since Mark did buy the blue shirt (statement 2), it must be the case that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
