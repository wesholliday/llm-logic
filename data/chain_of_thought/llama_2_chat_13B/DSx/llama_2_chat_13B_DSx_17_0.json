We also know that the flob is not movated.\n\nSo, can we infer that the flob is skizzled? Let's think about this for a moment...\n\nIf the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, because there is no other option. Skizzled is the only remaining possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
