The flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's assume that the first statement is true. If the flugel is blimmed, then it cannot be zargled, because these two states are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false.\n\nHowever, we also know that the second statement is true, because we have been told that the flugel is not zargled. This means that the first statement cannot be true, because if it were, the second statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is that the first statement must be false, and hence the flugel is not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
