This means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The smip is not lupped\". If the smip is not lupped, then we know that it must be shripped because of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
