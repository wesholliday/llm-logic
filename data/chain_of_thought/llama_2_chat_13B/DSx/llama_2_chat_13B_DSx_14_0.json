The clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, let's assume that the first statement is true. If the clug is fleeked, then it cannot be snugged, because these two words have opposite meanings. Therefore, if the clug is fleeked, we can infer that it is not snugged.\n\nOn the other hand, if the second statement is true, then the clug is not snugged. But this does not necessarily mean that it is fleeked. It could be neither fleeked nor snugged.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we cannot infer that the clug is fleeked. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
