This means that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"The dreb is not spened\". If the dreb is not spened, then we know that it cannot be spened. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nSo, based on the two sentences, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
