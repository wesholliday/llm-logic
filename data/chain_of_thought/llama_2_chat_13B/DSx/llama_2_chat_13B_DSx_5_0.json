The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's consider each possibility:\n\nCase 1: The zinger is fraggled.\nIn this case, we know that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled, and since it is not smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nCase 2: The zinger is not fraggled.\nIn this case, we know that the zinger is not fraggled, so it must be smoogled. But we have already established that the zinger is not smoogled, so this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible conclusion is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
