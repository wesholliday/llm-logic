The glip is not tragged.\n\nI can deduce that:\n\n3. The glip is either slogged or not slogged (i.e., the negation of \"not tragged\").\n\nNow, let me consider each possibility:\n\n4. If the glip is slogged, then it is slogged.\n5. If the glip is not slogged, then it is not slogged.\n\nBased on these two possibilities, I can conclude that:\n\n6. The glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
