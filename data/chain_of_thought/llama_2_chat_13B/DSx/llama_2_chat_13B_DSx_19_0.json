This means that one of two possibilities must be true: either the smonk is vreebled, or it is plagged.\n\nNext, we know that \"The smonk is not plagged\". This means that the second possibility, that the smonk is plagged, is not true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
