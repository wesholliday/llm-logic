This means that there are only two possible states of the grommet: sploffed or plopped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"The grommet is not plopped\". This sentence tells us that the grommet is not in the state of being plopped. So, if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be in the state of being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two sentences, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
