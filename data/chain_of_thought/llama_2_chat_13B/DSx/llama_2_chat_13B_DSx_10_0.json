This means that there are only two possible states of the wug: sproinged or garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"The wug is not garpled\". This tells us that the wug cannot be garpled. So, if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the two sentences, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
