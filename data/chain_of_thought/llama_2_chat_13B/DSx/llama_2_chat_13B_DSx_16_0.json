This means that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The sneg is not sproted\". This tells us that the sneg is not in a state of being sproted. Since we already know that the sneg cannot be both crampled and sproted, this means that the only possible state the sneg can be in is crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements given, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
