The premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\" This means that there is no logical necessity for the newspaper to be in the driveway.\n2. If there is no logical necessity for the newspaper to be in the driveway, then it is possible for the newspaper not to be in the driveway.\n3.
