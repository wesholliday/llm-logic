Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This means that it is possible for Lisa to have not bought the red shirt, even if she did buy another shirt.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\" This is a logical consequence of the premise, because if it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then it is possible that she didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
