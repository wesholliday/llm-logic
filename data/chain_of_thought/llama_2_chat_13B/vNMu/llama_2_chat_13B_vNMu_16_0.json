The premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\" This means that it is possible for the pen to not be in my bag, even if it is actually the case that the pen is in my bag.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"The pen might not be in my bag.\" This follows logically from the premise, because if it is not the case that the pen must be in my bag, then it is possible for the pen to not be in my bag.\n3. Therefore, the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
