            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This means that it is possible for Mary to not have been at the wedding.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This is a weaker statement than the premise, but it still implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n3. To determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to ask whether it is possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n4. If we assume that Mary must have been at the wedding (i.e., we assume the negation of the premise), then the conclusion \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" becomes false. This means that the argument is not logically valid, because the conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n5. Therefore, the answer is no, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
