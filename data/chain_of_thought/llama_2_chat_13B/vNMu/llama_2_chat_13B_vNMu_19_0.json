Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\" This means that it is possible for the watch to be charging on the dresser, but it is not necessary or guaranteed.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\" This means that since it is not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser, it is possible that it is not charging there.\n\nTo determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to ask ourselves if it is possible for the watch to be charging on the dresser even if it is not necessary or guaranteed.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have determined that the answer is yes. It is possible for the watch to be charging on the dresser even if it is not necessary or guaranteed. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
