Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\" This means that it is possible for the sunglasses to be somewhere else other than in her bag.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\" This follows logically from the premise because if the sunglasses are not necessarily in her bag, then they might not be in her bag.\n\nSo, the argument is structured as a disjunctive syllogism, with the premise providing a negative premise and the conclusion providing a possibility. The argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
