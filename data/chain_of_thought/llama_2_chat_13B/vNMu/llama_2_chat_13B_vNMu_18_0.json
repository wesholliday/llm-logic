The premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\" This means that it is possible for the notebook to be somewhere other than in the drawer.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\" This follows logically from the premise, since if it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer, then it is possible for the notebook to be somewhere else.\n3. Therefore, the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
