Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, even if we know that she chose one of the other options (A or B).\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\" This follows logically from the premise, because if it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, then there is a possibility that she did not choose pizza.\n\nSo, the argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise: It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nConclusion: Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nIs this form of argument logically valid? To determine this, we need to examine the reasoning more closely.\n\nThe premise is a negative statement, which means that it asserts the non-existence of something (in this case, the existence of a necessity that Sue chose pizza). The conclusion is also a negative statement, which means that it asserts the possibility of something not existing (in this case, the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nThe reasoning in the argument is based on the idea that if something is not necessary, then it is possible that it does not exist. This is a logical principle known as \"excluded middle,\" which states that any proposition is either true or false, and cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nApplying this principle to the argument, we can see that if it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, then it is possible that she did not choose pizza. This means that the conclusion \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, and the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
