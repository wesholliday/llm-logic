The premise of the argument is \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\" This means that it is possible for the book to have been written by someone other than James.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"The book might not have been written by James.\" This follows logically from the premise, since if it is possible for the book to have been written by someone other than James, then it is also possible that James did not write it.\n3. To determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does follow logically from the premise, since the possibility of the book having been written by someone other than James implies that James did not write it.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
