This means that there are only two possible locations for the pen: in my bag or on my desk.\n\nThe second premise states that the pen isn't on my desk. This means that the pen cannot be on my desk, which leaves only one possible location: in my bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
