This means that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: in my backpack or on the coat rack.\n\nThe second premise states that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack. This means that the scarf cannot be on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
