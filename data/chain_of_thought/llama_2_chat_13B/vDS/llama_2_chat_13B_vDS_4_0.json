This means that there are only two possible options for where the cat might be.\n\nThe second premise states that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. This eliminates one of the two possible options, leaving only one possibility: the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically conclude that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
