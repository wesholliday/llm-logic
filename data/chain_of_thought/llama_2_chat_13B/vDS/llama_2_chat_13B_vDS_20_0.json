This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
