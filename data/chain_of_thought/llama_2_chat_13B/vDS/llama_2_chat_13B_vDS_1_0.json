This means that there are only two possible locations for Fido: inside the house or in the garden.\n\nThe second premise states that Fido is not in the garden. This means that Fido cannot be in the garden, so he must be somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that Fido must be inside the house.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
