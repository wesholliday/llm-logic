Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise of the argument states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
