This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
