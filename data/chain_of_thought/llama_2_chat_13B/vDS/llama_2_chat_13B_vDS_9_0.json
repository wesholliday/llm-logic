Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise of the argument states that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
