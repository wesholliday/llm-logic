This means that there are only two possible locations for the watch: on the dresser or on his wrist.\n\nThe second premise states that the watch isn't on his wrist. This means that the watch must be in one of the remaining locations, which is on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
