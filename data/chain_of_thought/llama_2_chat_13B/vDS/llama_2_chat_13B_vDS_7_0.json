This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that the umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
