This means that there are only two possible locations for the toy: in the toy box or on the shelf.\n\nThe second premise states that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This means that the toy cannot be on the shelf, so it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
