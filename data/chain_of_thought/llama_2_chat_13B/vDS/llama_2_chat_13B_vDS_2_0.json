This means that there are only two possible locations for the book: on the shelf or on the table.\n\nThe second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. This means that the book cannot be on the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nSo, is this form of argument logically valid?\n\nAnswer: yes",
