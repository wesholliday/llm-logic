This means that there are only two possible locations for the milk: the counter or the fridge.\n\nThe second premise states that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This means that the milk must be located in one of the other possible locations, which is the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
