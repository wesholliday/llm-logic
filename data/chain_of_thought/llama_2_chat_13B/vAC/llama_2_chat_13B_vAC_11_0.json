This means that if the cake had been chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry.\n2. The second premise states that the muffins were blueberry. This means that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry. Since the muffins are blueberry, it follows that the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
