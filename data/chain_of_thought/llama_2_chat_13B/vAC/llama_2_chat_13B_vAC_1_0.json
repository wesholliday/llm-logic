            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended the wedding as well.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was at the wedding. This means that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding. This is because if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue would not have been at the wedding either (based on the first premise). But since Sue was at the wedding (according to the second premise), it follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nSo, the conclusion logically follows from the two premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
