This means that if Tom did watch football, then it must be the case that Jen watched basketball.\n2. The second premise states that Jen watched basketball. This is a given fact, so we can assume that it is true.\n3. Therefore, based on the first and second premises, we can conclude that Tom watched football. This is because if Tom did watch football, then Jen would have watched basketball, and since she did watch basketball, it must be the case that Tom watched football.\n\nNow, let me answer the question:\n\nAnswer: yes",
