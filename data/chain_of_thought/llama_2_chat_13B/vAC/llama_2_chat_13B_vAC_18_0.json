            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll had been made of plastic, then the truck would have been made of metal.\n2. The second premise states that the truck was metal. This means that the truck actually was made of metal.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the doll had been made of plastic, then the truck would have been made of metal. However, since the truck is already known to be made of metal, it follows that the doll must also be made of plastic.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
