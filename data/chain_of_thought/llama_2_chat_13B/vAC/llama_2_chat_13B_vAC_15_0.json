This means that if Sam did take a plane, then it must be the case that Erin took a train.\n2. The second premise states that Erin took a train. This is a given fact, so we can assume that it is true.\n3. Therefore, based on the first and second premises, we can conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nNow, let me think about whether this argument is logically valid...\n\nYes, I have determined that the argument is logically valid! Here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
