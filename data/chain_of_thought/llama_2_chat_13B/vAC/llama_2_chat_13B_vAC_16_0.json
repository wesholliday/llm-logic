This means that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must have been made of denim.\n2. The second premise states that the pants were denim. This means that the pants are indeed made of denim.\n3. Based on the first premise and the second premise, we can conclude that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nNow, let me think... Yes, I believe this argument is logically valid!\n\nAnswer: yes",
