This means that if the alien went to Mars, it must have also gone to Jupiter.\n2. The second premise states that the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the robot did go to Jupiter.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien must have also visited Mars.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
