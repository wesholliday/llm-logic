Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled: This statement implies that the fribble can only be in one of two states - either it is crinked or it is snurgled.\n2. The fribble might not be crinked: This statement suggests that the fribble is not necessarily crinked, and that there is a possibility that it is not crinked.\n3. If the fribble might not be crinked, then it must be snurgled: Based on the first two statements, if the fribble might not be crinked, then it must be in the state of snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
