The splat is quanked: If the splat is quanked, then it must be morphed, because quanking implies a change in shape or form. Therefore, if the splat is quanked, we can infer that it is morphed.\n2. The splat is not quanked: If the splat is not quanked, then it might not be morphed. However, we don't know for sure whether it is or isn't morphed.\n\nNow, let me summarize my reasoning:\n\n* If the splat is quanked, then it must be morphed.\n* If the splat is not quanked, then we can't infer whether it is morphed or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the splat might be morphed, but we can't say for sure whether it is or isn't.\n\nAnswer: no.",
