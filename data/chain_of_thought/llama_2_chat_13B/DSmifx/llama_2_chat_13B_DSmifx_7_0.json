This means that there are only two possible states of the whiffle: tinked or shanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"The whiffle might not be tinked\". This means that it is possible for the whiffle to not be tinked. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be in the other state, which is shanked.\n\nSo, based on the two premises, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked. This is because if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked, and there is no other possible state for the whiffle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
