This means that there are only two possible states of the smonk: plagued or vreebled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The smonk might not be plagged\". This statement implies that the smonk might not be in a plagued state. If the smonk is not plagued, then it must be in a vreebled state, because there are no other possible states.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled. This is because if the smonk is not plagued, then it must be vreebled, and there is no other possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
