This means that the glip is not necessarily tragged. In other words, there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged.\n\nSo, if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged, because we know from the first premise that the glip must be one of two things: either tragged or slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
