This means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The smip might not be lupped\". This statement implies that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped. If the smip is not lupped, then we know that it must be shripped based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on both statements together, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
