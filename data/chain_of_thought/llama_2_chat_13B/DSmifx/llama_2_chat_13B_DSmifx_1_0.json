This means that there are only two possible states of the flugel: zargled or blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The flugel might not be zargled\". This statement implies that the flugel is not necessarily zargled. In other words, it is possible for the flugel to be in a state other than zargled.\n\nSo, if the flugel might not be zargled, then we can infer that it is blimmed. This is because the only other possible state of the flugel, besides zargled, is blimmed. Therefore, if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
