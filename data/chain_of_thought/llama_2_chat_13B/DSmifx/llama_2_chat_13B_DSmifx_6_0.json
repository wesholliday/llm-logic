This sentence implies that there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nSo, if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed, because we know from the first sentence that the grommet is either plopped or sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two sentences, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
