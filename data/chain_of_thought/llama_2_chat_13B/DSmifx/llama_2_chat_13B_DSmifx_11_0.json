This means that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nSo, if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed, because the only other option is that it is neither zimmed nor blummed, which is not possible given the two premises.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
