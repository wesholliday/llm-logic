This means that there are only two possible states of the fleeg: surned and bluttered.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The fleeg might not be surned\". This statement implies that the fleeg is not necessarily surned. In other words, it is possible for the fleeg to be in a state other than surned.\n\nSo, if the fleeg might not be surned, then it must be in one of the other states, which is bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
