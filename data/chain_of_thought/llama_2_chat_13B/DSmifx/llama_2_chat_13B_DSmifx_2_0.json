This means that the wug could be either bimmed or flooped, but it might not be bimmed.\n\nSo, if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped, because there is no other option left. In other words, if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be one of the two remaining options, and the only remaining option is flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
