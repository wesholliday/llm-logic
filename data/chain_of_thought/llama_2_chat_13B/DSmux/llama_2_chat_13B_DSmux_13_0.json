This means that one of two things is true: either the glip is slogged, or it must be tragged (but not both).\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the glip must be tragged. This means that the second option (the glip must be tragged) is not true.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the glip is slogged.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
