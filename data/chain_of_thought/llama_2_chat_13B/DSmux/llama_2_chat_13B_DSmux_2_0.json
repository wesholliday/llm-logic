This means that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooded.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\". This sentence tells us that the wug does not have to be bimmed. So, if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nBased on these two sentences, we can infer that the wug is flooded. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
