This means that there are only two possible states of the splat: morphed or quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This tells us that the splat cannot be in the state of being quanked. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat must be in the state of being morphed.\n\nSo, based on our reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
