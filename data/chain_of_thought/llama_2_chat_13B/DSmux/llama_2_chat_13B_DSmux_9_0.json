This means that one of two things is true: either the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked.\n2. We also know that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. This means that the second option - that the twonk must be plinked - is not true.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
