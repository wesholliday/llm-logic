This means that there are only two possible states for the smip: shripped and lupped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second sentence \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\". This sentence tells us that the smip cannot be in the state of being lupped. Therefore, we can infer that the smip must be in the state of being shripped.\n\nSo, based on the two sentences, we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
