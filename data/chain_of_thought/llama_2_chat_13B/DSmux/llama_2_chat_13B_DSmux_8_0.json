It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked. Here's why:\n\n1. If the sprocket were daggled, then it would be the case that the sprocket must be daggled (since \"daggle\" means to bend or twist out of shape). But we know from statement 2 that this is not the case.\n2. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
