The smonk is not plagged.\n\nNow, let's assume that the first statement is true. If the smonk is plagged, then it cannot be vreebled, because the two words are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false.\n\nOn the other hand, if the second statement is true, then the first statement must be false. But this means that the smonk is not plagged, which implies that it is vreebled.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
