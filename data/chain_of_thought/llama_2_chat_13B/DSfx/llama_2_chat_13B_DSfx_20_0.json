We also know that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nSo, let's assume that the fleeg is surned. If the fleeg is surned, then it must be bluttered, because the two statements are mutually exclusive (i.e., if the fleeg is surned, it cannot also be bluttered).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
