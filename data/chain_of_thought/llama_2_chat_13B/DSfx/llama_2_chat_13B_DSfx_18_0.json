The shank is not nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider each possibility:\n\nCase 1: The shank is nugged.\nIn this case, we know that the shank is not plooked, since \"nugged\" and \"plooked\" are mutually exclusive possibilities. So, if the shank is nugged, it cannot be plooked.\n\nCase 2: The shank is plooked.\nIn this case, we know that the shank is not nugged, since \"nugged\" and \"plooked\" are mutually exclusive possibilities. So, if the shank is plooked, it cannot be nugged.\n\nNow, let's combine these two cases:\n\nSince the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
