This means that there are only two possible states of the clug: snugged or fleeked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The clug is not snugged\". This means that the clug cannot be snugged. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nSo, based on the two statements, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
