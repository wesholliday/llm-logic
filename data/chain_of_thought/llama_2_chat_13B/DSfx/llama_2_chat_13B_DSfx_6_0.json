This means that one of these two statements must be true.\n\nSecond, we are also given that the grommet is not plopped. This means that the grommet cannot be plopped.\n\nNow, if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed. This is because \"plopped\" and \"sploffed\" are mutually exclusive possibilities, and we have already ruled out the possibility of the grommet being plopped.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
