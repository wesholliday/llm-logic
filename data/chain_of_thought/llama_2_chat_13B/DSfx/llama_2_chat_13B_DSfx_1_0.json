The flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's assume that the first statement is true. If the flugel is zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, because zargling and blimming are mutually exclusive states. Therefore, if the flugel is zargled, we can conclude that it is not blimmed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the second statement is true, then the flugel is not zargled. This means that the flugel is in a state where it can be either zargled or blimmed. Since we know that the flugel is not zargled, we can conclude that it must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements given, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
