This means that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The dreb is not spened\". If the dreb is not spened, then we know that it cannot be spened, and therefore it must be vroombed.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
