This means that there are only two possible states for the smip: lupped or shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The smip is not lupped\". This tells us that the smip cannot be lupped. So, if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
