Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped: This statement presents two possibilities for the grommet's state: either it is sploffed or it must be plopped.\n3. If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed: Based on the first statement, if the grommet is not plopped, then it cannot be in any other state but sploffed.\n4. Therefore, the grommet is sploffed: Concluding from the previous three statements, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
