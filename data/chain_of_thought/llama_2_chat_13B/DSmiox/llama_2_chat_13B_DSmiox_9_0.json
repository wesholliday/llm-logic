The sentence \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" states that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked (there is no middle ground).\n3. If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished (based on the second sentence).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
