This sentence tells us that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nNow, let's combine these two sentences: \"The wug might not be bimmed\" and \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\". We can infer that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
