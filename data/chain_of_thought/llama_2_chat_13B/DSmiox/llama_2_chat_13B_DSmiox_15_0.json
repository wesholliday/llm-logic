The dreb might not be spened: This statement suggests that the dreb is not necessarily spent (i.e., used up or exhausted).\n2. Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened: This statement presents two possibilities for the dreb's state: either it is vroombed (i.e., in use) or it must be spent (i.e., used up).\n3. Therefore, if the dreb is not spent, it must be vroombed: Based on the previous two statements, if the dreb is not spent, then it must be in use (i.e., vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
