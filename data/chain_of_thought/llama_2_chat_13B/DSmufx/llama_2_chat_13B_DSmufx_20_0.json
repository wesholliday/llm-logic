We also know that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" is a true statement.\n3. If the fleeg must be surned, then it is not bluttered (by definition of \"surned\").\n4. Therefore, if the fleeg is not surned, it must be bluttered (by modus tollens).\n5. So, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
