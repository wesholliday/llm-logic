We know that \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This means that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\" This means that the flob is not required to be movated.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that the flob is skizzled. This is because if the flob is not movated and it is not required to be movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
