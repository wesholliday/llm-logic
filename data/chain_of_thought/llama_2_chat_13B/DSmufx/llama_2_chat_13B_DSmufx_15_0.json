We also know that \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" is a true statement.\n3. From these two statements, we can infer that the dreb is not spened (because if it were, the first statement would not be true).\n4. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
