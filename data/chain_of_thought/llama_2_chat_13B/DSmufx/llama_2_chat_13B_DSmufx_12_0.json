This means that there are only two possible states of the smip: lupped or shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\". This statement tells us that the smip is not lupped. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nSo, based on the two statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
