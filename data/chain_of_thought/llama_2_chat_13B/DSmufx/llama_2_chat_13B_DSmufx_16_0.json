The statement \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\" implies that one of two possibilities is true: either the sneg is sproted, or it is crampled.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" means that the first possibility (the sneg being sproted) is not true.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
