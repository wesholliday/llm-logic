This means that there are only two possible states of the shank: nugged or plooked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\". This means that the shank cannot be nugged. So, if the shank cannot be nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
