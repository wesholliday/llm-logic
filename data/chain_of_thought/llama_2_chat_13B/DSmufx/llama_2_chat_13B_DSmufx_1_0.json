It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n\nI need to find a way to logically deduce 'The flugel is blimmed' from these two statements. Let me think...\n\nHmmm... I see! If it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled, then we can infer that the flugel is not zargled. But if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed (by the first statement). Therefore, we can deduce 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
