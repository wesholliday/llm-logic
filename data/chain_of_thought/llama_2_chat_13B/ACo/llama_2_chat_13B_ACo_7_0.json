The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is met. In this case, the condition is met, so the statement is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that Alex finished the race, because if Alex had not finished the race, then the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" would be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
