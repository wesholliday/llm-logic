We are also given the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n3. To infer the truth of the statement \"The apple was red,\" we need to assume that the apple was red and see if it follows logically that the banana was yellow.\n4. If we assume that the apple was red, then the conditional statement becomes true, and we know that the banana was yellow (by modus ponens).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
