The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding. In other words, if Mary \u2260 Not at the wedding, then Sue \u2260 Not at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
