The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the conclusion (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n3. Therefore, if we know that Erin took a train, we can infer that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" must be true as well.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
