The sentence \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, which means that if one part of the sentence (Joe going to the park) is true, then the other part of the sentence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. Therefore, if we know that Lucy went to the zoo, and we know that the conditional statement is true, then we can infer that Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
