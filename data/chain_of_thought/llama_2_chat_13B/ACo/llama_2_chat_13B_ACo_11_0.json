We are also given the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n3. To infer whether the cake was chocolate, we need to determine if the muffins were blueberry.\n4. Based on the given information, the muffins were blueberry (as stated in the first sentence).\n5. Therefore, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry (based on the conditional statement).\n6. So, we can infer that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
