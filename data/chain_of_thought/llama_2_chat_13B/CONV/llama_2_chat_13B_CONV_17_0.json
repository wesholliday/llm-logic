If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. This means that if Kate ate salad, it is true that Ben ate pasta.\n3. The two statements are logically equivalent. In other words, if one statement is true (Ben ate pasta), the other statement must also be true (Kate ate salad).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
