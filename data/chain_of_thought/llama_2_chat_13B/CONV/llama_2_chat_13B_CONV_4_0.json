This means that if the alien went to Mars, the robot also went to Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario. If the robot visited Jupiter, does that mean the alien visited Mars? Well, we know that the robot only went to Jupiter because the alien went to Mars. So, if the robot is now on Jupiter, it must have gone there after visiting Mars with the alien.\n\nTherefore, if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien must have visited Mars. This inference is logically sound, as we can deduce that the alien went to Mars based on the fact that the robot went to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
