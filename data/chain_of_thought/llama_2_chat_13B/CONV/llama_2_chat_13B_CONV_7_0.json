This means that if Alex crossed the finish line, then Chris also crossed the finish line (logical consequence of \"if-then\" statement)\n3. Therefore, if Chris crossed the finish line, then Alex also crossed the finish line (transitive property of logic)\n4. So, if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: yes",
