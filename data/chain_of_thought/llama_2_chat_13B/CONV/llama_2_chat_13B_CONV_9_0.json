This means that if Lisa had chosen to buy the red shirt, she would have been unable to buy the blue shirt. (logical consequence of the given statement)\n3. Therefore, if Mark bought the blue shirt, it must be the case that he did so instead of Lisa buying the red shirt. (logical consequence of the previous step)\n4.
