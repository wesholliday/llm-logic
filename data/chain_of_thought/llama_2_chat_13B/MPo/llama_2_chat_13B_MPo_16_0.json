From this premise, we can infer that the shirt was made of a specific material (cotton).\n3. The sentence \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants.\n4. Based on this conditional statement, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been made of a different material (denim).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
