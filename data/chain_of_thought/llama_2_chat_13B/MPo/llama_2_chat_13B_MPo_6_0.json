If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nSo, we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. But we only know that Sue chose pizza, not that she actually did choose it.\n\nHmmm... I think I need to consider the possibility that Sue might not have chosen pizza. If that's the case, then we can't infer that Bob chose pasta.\n\nWait a minute... I just realized something! Even if Sue didn't choose pizza, it still follows that Bob chose pasta. Why? Because the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement, and conditionals are true by default when the antecedent (Sue choosing pizza) is false.\n\nSo, even if Sue didn't choose pizza, we can still infer that Bob chose pasta based on the conditional statement!\n\nAnswer: yes",
