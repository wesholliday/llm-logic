The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, which means that if one part of the sentence (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the other part of the sentence (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that Alex finished the race, it follows that Chris finished the race as well, because the condition in the conditional statement has been met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
