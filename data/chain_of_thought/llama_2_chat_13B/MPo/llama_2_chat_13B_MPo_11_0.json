We are also given the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n3. To infer the truth of the statement \"The muffins were blueberry,\" we need to assume that the cake was indeed chocolate and see if the conditional statement leads us to a true conclusion.\n4. If the cake was chocolate, then it is possible that the muffins were blueberry (based on the given conditional statement).\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
