We are also given the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n3. To infer the truth of the statement \"The banana was yellow,\" we need to determine if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true.\n4. Based on the first sentence, we know that the apple was red.\n5. Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n6. By the principle of conditional proof, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n7. So, we can infer that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
