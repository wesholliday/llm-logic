This statement implies that if the shank was plooked (i.e., if the shank had a certain characteristic), then it must have been nugged (i.e., it must have had another characteristic).\n3. Therefore, if we assume that the shank was not plooked, we can conclude that it did not have the characteristic of being nugged.\n4. In other words, if the shank was not plooked, then it is not possible for it to have been nugged.\n5. So, we can infer that if the shank was not plooked, then it was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
