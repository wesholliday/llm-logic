This statement implies that if the glip was slogged (i.e., if the condition \"slogged\" is true), then it must also be tragged (i.e., if the condition \"tragged\" is true).\n3. Therefore, if we know that the glip was not slogged, we can conclude that it must not be tragged either.\n4. So, the statement \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" logically follows from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
