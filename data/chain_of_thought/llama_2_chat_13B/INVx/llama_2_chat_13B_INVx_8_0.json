The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the two conditions.\n2. If the sprocket was not cranked, then it cannot be daggled, because the condition \"cranked\" is a necessary precondition for the condition \"dagged\".\n3. Therefore, if the sprocket was not cranked, then it must not be daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
