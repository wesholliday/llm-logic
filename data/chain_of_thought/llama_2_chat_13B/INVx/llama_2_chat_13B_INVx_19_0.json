This statement implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have been plagged (since \"vreebled\" and \"plagged\" are synonyms).\n3. Therefore, if we negate the hypothesis \"the smonk was vreebled\", we can deduce that the conclusion \"the smonk plagged\" cannot be true.\n4. So, if the smonk was not vreebled, then it must not have been plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
