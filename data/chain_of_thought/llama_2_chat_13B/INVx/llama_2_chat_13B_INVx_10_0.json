The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" implies that there is a direct relationship between being sproinged and being garpled.\n2. If we negate the first part of the statement (\"If the wug was not sproinged\"), we get \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\".\n3. This negated statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, since if the wug was not sproinged, then it cannot be garpled (by definition).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
