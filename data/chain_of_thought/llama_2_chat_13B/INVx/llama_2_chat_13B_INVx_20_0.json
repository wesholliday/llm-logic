The statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" implies that there is a causal relationship between being bluttered and surning.\n2. If we assume that the fleeg was not bluttered, then we can logically deduce that it did not surn, because the causal relationship between being bluttered and surning does not apply in this case.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\n\nAnswer: yes",
