Here we go!\n\nSo, the given statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" Let me break this down into smaller parts:\n\n1. If the fribble was snurgled: This means that something happened to the fribble, and we don't know what that something is.\n2. Then the fribble crinked: This means that as a result of whatever happened to the fribble, it became crinkled.\n\nNow, let's think about the inverse of this statement. If we were to say \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink,\" what would that mean?\n\n1. If the fribble was not snurgled: This means that nothing happened to the fribble, so it remains in its original state.\n2. Then the fribble did not crink: This means that since nothing happened to the fribble, it did not become crinkled.\n\nSo, if we substitute \"not snurgled\" for \"snurgled\" in the original statement, we get:\n\nIf the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\n\nAnd that's exactly the same as saying \"If the fribble was not crinked.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the fribble was not snurgled, then it did not crink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
