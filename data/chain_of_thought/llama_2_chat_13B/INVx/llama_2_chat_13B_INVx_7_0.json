The sentence \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" implies that there is a direct relationship between shanking the whiffle and it tinking.\n2. If the whiffle was not shanked, then it cannot be assumed that it tinked.\n3. Therefore, if the whiffle did not tink, we can infer that it was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
