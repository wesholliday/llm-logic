This statement implies that if the splat was morphed (i.e., changed in some way), then it quanked (i.e., made a certain sound).\n3. If the splat was not morphed, then it did not change in any way.\n4. Therefore, if the splat did not change in any way, it is unlikely that it would have made a sound (i.e., quanked).\n5. Conclusion: If the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
