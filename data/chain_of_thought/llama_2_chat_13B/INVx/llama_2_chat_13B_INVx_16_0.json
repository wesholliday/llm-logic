In other words, we need to change \"crampled\" to \"not crampled\".\n\nSo, the opposite statement would be:\n\n\"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nNow, let me think about whether this statement is true or false...\n\nHmmm... if the sneg was not crampled, then it's possible that it didn't sprot the frink. But, it's also possible that it did sprot the frink even if it wasn't crampled. After all, there could be other reasons why the sneg might sprot the frink! \ud83e\udd14\n\nSo, I'm not sure if this statement is true or false... \ud83d\ude15\n\nWait a minute! I just realized something... \ud83d\udca1\n\nThe word \"sneg\" is a made-up word, and it doesn't make any sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, we can't infer anything about the statement being true or false! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnswer: no \ud83d\ude04",
