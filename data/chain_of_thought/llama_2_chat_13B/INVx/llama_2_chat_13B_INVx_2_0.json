The sentence \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" implies that there is a causal relationship between being flooped and bimming the zoint.\n2. If the wug was not flooped, then it did not experience the causal effect of being bimmed the zoint.\n3. Therefore, if the wug was not flooped, we can infer that it did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
