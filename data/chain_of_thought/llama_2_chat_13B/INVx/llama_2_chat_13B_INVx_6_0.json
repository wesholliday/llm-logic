In other words, if the grommet was sploffed, it must have plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the premise: \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\" This statement is logically equivalent to \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then it did not plop the frink.\"\n\nSo, if we assume that the grommet was not sploffed, we can conclude that it did not plop the frink. In other words, the negation of the premise leads to a logical contradiction, which means that the original statement must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
