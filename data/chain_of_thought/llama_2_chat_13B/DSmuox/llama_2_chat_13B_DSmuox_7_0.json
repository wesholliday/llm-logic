We know that \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\" This means that it is possible for the whiffle to exist without being tinked.\n2. We also know that \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\" This means that if the whiffle is not shanked, then it must be tinked.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
