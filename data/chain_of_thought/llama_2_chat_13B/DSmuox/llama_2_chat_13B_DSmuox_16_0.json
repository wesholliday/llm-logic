We know that \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" (premise).\n2. We also know that \"Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted\" (premise).\n3. If the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted (logical implication of premise 2).\n4. However, we have already established in premise 1 that the sneg is not sproted.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg is crampled (logical deduction from premises 2 and 4).\n\nNow, based on my reasoning, I will answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
