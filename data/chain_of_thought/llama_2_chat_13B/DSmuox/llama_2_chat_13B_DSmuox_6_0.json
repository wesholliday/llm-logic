We know that \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This means that it is possible for the grommet to be in a state other than being plopped.\n2. We also know that \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\" This means that the grommet can only be in one of two states: sploffed or plopped.\n3. If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed (by the law of non-contradiction).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
