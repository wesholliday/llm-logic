We know that \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled\" is true, because if it were the case, then we would have to conclude that the zinger is smoogled, which contradicts the first premise.\n2. We also know that \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" is true, because if the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled (by definition of \"fraggled\").\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger is not fraggled, because if it were fraggled, we would have to conclude that it is smoogled, which contradicts the first premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
