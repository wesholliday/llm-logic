From this statement, we can infer that there is no requirement for the fleeg to be surned.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\".\n4. If the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned (this follows logically from the statement).\n5. However, we have already established that there is no requirement for the fleeg to be surned (step 1).\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
