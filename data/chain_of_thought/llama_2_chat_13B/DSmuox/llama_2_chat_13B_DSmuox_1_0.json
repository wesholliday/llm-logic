We know that \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" is true, because if it were required to be zargled, then it would be the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n2. We also know that \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" is true, because if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled (or vice versa).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed, because if it were not blimmed, then it would be required to be zargled (according to the second statement).\n\nAnswer: yes",
