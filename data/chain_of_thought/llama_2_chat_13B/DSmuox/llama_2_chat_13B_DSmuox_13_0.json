From this premise, we can infer that there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged (modus tollens).\n3. Now, let's consider the second premise: \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged\".\n4. If the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged (from the second premise).\n5. Therefore, we have shown that if the glip is not tragged, then it is slogged.\n6. But we already know that the glip is not tragged (premise 1), so we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
