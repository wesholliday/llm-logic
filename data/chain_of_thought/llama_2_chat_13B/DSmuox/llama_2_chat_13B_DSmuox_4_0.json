We also know that \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" (this is given in the question).\n3. If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled (this follows from the second statement).\n4. Therefore, if the fribble is not crinked, we can infer that it is snurgled.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
