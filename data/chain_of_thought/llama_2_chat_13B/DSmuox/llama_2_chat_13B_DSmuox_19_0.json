We also know that \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged\" (this is given in the question).\n3. If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled (this follows from the second statement).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
