From this statement, we can infer that the flob is not required to be movated.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated\".\n4. If the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated (this follows from the second statement).\n5. Since we have already established that the flob is not required to be movated, we can conclude that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
