From this statement, we can infer that there is no requirement for the flug to be zimmed. In other words, it is possible for the flug to exist without being zimmed.\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\". This statement implies that there are only two possibilities for the flug: either it is blummed or it must be zimmed.\n4. Since we have already established that there is no requirement for the flug to be zimmed, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
