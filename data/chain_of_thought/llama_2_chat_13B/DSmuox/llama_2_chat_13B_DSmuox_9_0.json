We know that \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\" (this is the negation of the statement \"The twonk must be plinked\").\n2. We also know that \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" (this is a logical disjunction, meaning that one or the other must be true).\n3. If we assume that the first statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked\" is true, then we can deduce that the second statement \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" must be false (since if the first statement is true, then the second statement cannot be true).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the third statement \"The twonk is varnished\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
