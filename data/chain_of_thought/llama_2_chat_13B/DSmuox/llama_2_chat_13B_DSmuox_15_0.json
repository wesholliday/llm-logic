From this statement, we can infer that there is a possibility that the dreb is not spened (since it's not the case that it must be spened).\n3. Now, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\".\n4. If the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened (this follows logically from the wording of the statement).\n5. Therefore, if the dreb is not vroombed, we can infer that it must be spened.\n6. However, we already know that the dreb is not spened (from step 1), so this means that the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
