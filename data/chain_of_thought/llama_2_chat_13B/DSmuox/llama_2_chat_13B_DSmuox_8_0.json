The statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" means that it is possible for the sprocket to be in a state where it is not daggled.\n2. The statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n3. If the sprocket is not daggled and it must be cranked, then it follows that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
