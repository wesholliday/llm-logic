The statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" implies that if the fribble was subjected to the action of snurgling, then it did not undergo the action of crinking.\n2. This implies that there is a negative relationship between snurgling and crinking, meaning that if one occurs, the other cannot.\n3. Therefore, if we assume that the fribble did crink, we can logically deduce that it was not snurgled, since the two actions are mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
