The statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\" implies that being vreebled and plagging are mutually exclusive events. In other words, if the smonk is vreebled, then it cannot be plagged.\n2. Therefore, if we assume that the smonk is plagged, we can conclude that it is not vreebled.\n3. So, the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" logically follows from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
