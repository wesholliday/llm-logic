This statement implies that if the whiffle was shanked (i.e., hit with a sharp edge), then it did not make a tinkling sound (i.e., \"tink\").\n3. Therefore, if the whiffle did make a tinkling sound, then it must not have been shanked.\n4. So, we can infer that if the whiffle tinked, then it was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
