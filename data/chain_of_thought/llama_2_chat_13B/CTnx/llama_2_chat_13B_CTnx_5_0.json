This means that if the zinger was in a state of being fraggled, then it cannot be in a state of being smoogled.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse statement: \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\". This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the words \"fraggled\" and \"smoogled\" reversed.\n\nSo, if we assume that the zinger was smoogled, then we can conclude that it was not fraggled, because being smoogled is mutually exclusive with being fraggled. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
