The statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movate\" implies that if the flob was in a state of being skizzled, then it did not move.\n2. This implies that movement is incompatible with being skizzled. In other words, if the flob is moving, it cannot be skizzled.\n3. Therefore, if the flob movated (i.e., moved), then it must not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
