In other words, we need to assume that the sneg was not crampled and see if the resulting statement is true.\n\nSo, let's assume that the sneg was not crampled:\n\n\"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did sproted the frink.\"\n\nNow, we can substitute the negation of the first statement into the second statement:\n\n\"If the sneg did not crample, then the sneg did sproted the frink.\"\n\nThis results in a true statement! Therefore, we can infer that if the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \ud83d\ude0a",
