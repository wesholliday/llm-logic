The statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" implies that if the clug was in a state of being fleeked, then it cannot be in a state of being snugged at the same time.\n2. This means that if the clug is snugged, then it must not be fleeked.\n3. Therefore, if we know that the clug is snugged, we can infer that it is not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
