This means that if the fleeg had been bluttered, it would not have surned (logical consequence of the given statement)\n3. Therefore, if the fleeg surned, then it must not have been bluttered (inference)\n4. In other words, if the fleeg did not have the property of being bluttered, then it must have had the property of surning (logical consequence of the given statement and the inference)\n5. So, we can infer that if the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
