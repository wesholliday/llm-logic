If we negate the statement, we get \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was not plinked.\" This means that if the twonk had varnish applied to it, then it did not have any plinking (whatever that is).\n\nSo, based on the given statement and its inverse, we can infer that if the twonk was varnished, then it was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
