The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled\" implies that if the wug was subjected to the action of sproinging, then it did not undergo the action of garpling.\n2. This implies that there is a negative relationship between sproinging and garpling, meaning that if the wug was sproinged, then it cannot have been garpled at the same time.\n3. Therefore, if we know that the wug was garpled, we can infer that it was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
