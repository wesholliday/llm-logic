The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" implies that if the dreb was in a state of being vroombed, then it cannot be in a state of being spened.\n2. This means that if the dreb is spened, then it must not be vroombed.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the dreb is spened, then it was not vroomed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
