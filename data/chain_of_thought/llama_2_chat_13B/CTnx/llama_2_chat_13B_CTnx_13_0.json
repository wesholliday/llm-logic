This statement implies that if the glip was slogged, then it cannot be tragged.\n3. Therefore, if the glip was tragged, then it must not have been slogged.\n4. Conversely, if the glip was not tragged, then it could have been slogged.\n5. Based on these statements, we can infer that \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
