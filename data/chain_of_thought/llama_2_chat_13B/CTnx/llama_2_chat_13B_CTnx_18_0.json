The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" implies that if the shank was subjected to a process called \"plooking\", then it was not subjected to another process called \"nugging\".\n2. The word \"plooking\" is not defined in the statement, so we can't assume anything about what it means.\n3. However, based on the word \"not\", we can infer that \"plooking\" must be a process that results in the shank being in a certain state (i.e., not nugged).\n4. Therefore, if the shank was nugged, then it must not have been plooked, because if it had been plooked, it would not be in the nugged state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
