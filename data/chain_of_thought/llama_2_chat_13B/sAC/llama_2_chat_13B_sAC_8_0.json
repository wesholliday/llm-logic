We also know that 'The mummy was awake' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' has been satisfied, since the mummy was indeed awake.\n4. By modus ponens, if the antecedent (the first part of the conditional statement) is true, then the consequent (the second part of the conditional statement) must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'If the vampire was awake', and the consequent is 'Then the mummy was awake'.\n5. Since we have established that the mummy was awake, it follows that the antecedent of the conditional statement (i.e., 'If the vampire was awake') must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
