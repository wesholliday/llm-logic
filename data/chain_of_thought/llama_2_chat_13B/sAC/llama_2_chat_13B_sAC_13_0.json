We also know that 'The truck was blue' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the condition in the if-statement is satisfied, i.e., the car was red.\n4. So, the conclusion of the if-statement, \"then the truck was blue\", is true.\n5. Since the conclusion is true, we can conclude that the premise, \"the car was red\", is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
