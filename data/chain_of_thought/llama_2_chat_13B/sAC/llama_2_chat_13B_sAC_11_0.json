We also know that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' has a true antecedent (the cake being chocolate) and a true consequent (the muffins being blueberry).\n4. Logically, if the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, then the conditional statement is true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
