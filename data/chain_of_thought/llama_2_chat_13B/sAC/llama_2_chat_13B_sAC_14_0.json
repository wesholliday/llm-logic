If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (given statement).\n3. Therefore, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (logical consequence of the given statement).\n4. We know that the wolf was in the den, so it follows that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would have been in the den.\n5. Therefore, it can be inferred that if the bear was in the cave, then the bear was in the den (logical consequence of the given statement and the fact that the wolf was in the den).\n\nAnswer: yes",
