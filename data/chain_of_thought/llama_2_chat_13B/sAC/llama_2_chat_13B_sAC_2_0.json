We also know that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" has been satisfied, since we know that the unicorn was indeed in the forest.\n4. By modus ponens, if all premises of a conditional statement are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is true, and the conclusion is \"The griffin was in the forest\".\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
