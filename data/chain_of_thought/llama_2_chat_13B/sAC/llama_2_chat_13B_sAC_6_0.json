We also know that 'Bob chose pasta' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' has been fulfilled, since Bob did choose pasta.\n4. The antecedent of the conditional statement is 'Sue chose pizza', so if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that 'Sue chose pizza' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
