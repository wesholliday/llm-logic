We also know that 'Erin took a train' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If Sam took a plane, then ...' is true because the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) is true.\n4. Since the consequent (Erin took a train) is already known to be true, we can conclude that the hypothesis (Sam took a plane) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
