We also know that 'The truck was metal' is true.\n3. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal.\n4. Since the truck is metal, it means that the condition in the conditional statement has been fulfilled (i.e., the truck is metal).\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
