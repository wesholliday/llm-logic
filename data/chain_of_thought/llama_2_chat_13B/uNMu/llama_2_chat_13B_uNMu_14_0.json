Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" means that there is no requirement for the milk to be on the counter. This implies that the milk might not be on the counter, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not on the counter.\n\nSo, based on this statement, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk might not be on the counter. There is a possibility that the milk might be on the counter, even though it is not required to be there.\n\nAnswer: no",
