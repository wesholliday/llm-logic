Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" means that there is no guarantee that the sunglasses are in her bag. It only means that we can't assume they are definitely in her bag based on the information given.\n\nSo, if the sunglasses are not in her bag, then it is possible that they might not be in her bag. In other words, the absence of evidence that the sunglasses are in her bag does not prove that they are not in her bag, but it does create a possibility that they might not be there.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
