Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" means that there is no requirement for the shoes to be in the closet. This implies that the shoes could potentially be located elsewhere.\n\nIf the shoes are not required to be in the closet, then it is possible that they might not be in the closet. In other words, the absence of a requirement for the shoes to be in the closet suggests that they might not be there.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
