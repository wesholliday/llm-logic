Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means that there is no evidence to suggest that the griffin was in the forest. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest. In other words, the absence of evidence does not prove the non-existence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the griffin might not have been in the forest. Instead, we can only say that there is no evidence to suggest that the griffin was in the forest, but we cannot rule out the possibility that the griffin might have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
