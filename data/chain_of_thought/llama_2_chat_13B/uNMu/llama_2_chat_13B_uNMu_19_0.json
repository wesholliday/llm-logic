Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" means that there is no requirement for the watch to be charging on the dresser. This implies that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not charging at all.\n\nSo, based on this information, can we infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser?\n\nAnswer: yes",
