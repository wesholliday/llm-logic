Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" means that there is no requirement for the jacket to be draped over the chair. This implies that the jacket could potentially be in a different location or position, such as being worn by someone or hanging on a hook.\n\nSince we know that the jacket is not required to be draped over the chair, it is possible that the jacket might not be draped over the chair. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
