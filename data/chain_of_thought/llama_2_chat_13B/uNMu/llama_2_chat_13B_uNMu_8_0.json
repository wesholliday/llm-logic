Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" means that the vampire could have been asleep or unconscious during the time when the sun rose. This implies that the vampire might not have been awake, since being asleep or unconscious would preclude them from being awake.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, we can infer that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
