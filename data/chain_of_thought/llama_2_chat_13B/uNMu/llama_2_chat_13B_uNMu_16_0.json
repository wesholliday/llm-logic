The statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" means that there is no requirement or necessity for the pen to be in my bag.\n2. This implies that the pen might not be in my bag, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not in my bag.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the pen is not in my bag based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
