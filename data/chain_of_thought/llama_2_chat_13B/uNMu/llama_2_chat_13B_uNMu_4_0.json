Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" means that there is no evidence to suggest that the alien has been to Mars. This implies that there is no proof of the alien's presence on Mars, which in turn suggests that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, can we infer that the alien might not have visited Mars?
