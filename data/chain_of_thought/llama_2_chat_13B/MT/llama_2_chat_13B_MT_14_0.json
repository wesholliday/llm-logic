We also know that \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nSo, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that:\n\n3. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would have been in the den (based on the first statement).\n4. But we know that the wolf was not in the den (based on the second statement).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n5. The bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
