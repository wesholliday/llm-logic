The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nSo, we can infer that...\n\n3. The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nWait, what? How did we get from 1 and 2 to 3? Let me think this through again.\n\nHmmm... I see now. We can deduce that the alien did not visit Mars because if the alien had visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, but we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
