If the truck was not made of metal, then what can we infer about the doll? Well, if the truck was not made of metal, then it must have been made of something else. And since we know that the doll was not made of metal (because if it was, the truck would have been made of metal), we can infer that the doll was made of the same material as the truck.\n\nSo, if the truck was not made of metal, then the doll was not made of plastic. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
