The premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This means that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must have been made of denim.\n2. If we assume that the pants were not made of denim, then we can logically conclude that the shirt was not made of cotton.\n3. This is because the premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Therefore, if the pants were not denim, it follows that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
