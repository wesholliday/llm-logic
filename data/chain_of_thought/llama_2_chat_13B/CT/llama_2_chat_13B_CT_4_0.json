The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's assume that the alien visited Mars. This means that the robot visited Jupiter, according to statement 1. But wait, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter, according to statement 2!\n\nThis creates a logical contradiction, as we cannot have both statements be true at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
