So, if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nBut what if the banana was not yellow? Well, in that case, we know that the apple was not red, because the premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
