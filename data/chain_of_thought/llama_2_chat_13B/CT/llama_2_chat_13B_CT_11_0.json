A conditional statement has two parts: the \"if\" part and the \"then\" part.\n3. In this case, the \"if\" part is \"the cake was chocolate\" and the \"then\" part is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n4. If we assume that the cake was chocolate, then it follows logically that the muffins were blueberry.\n5. Therefore, if we know that the muffins were not blueberry, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
