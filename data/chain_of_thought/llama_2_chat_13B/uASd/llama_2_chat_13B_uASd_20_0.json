Expired medication may not contain the same amount of active ingredients as when it was fresh, and it may even be contaminated with harmful substances.\n\nSo, if I take expired medication, it is unlikely that I will feel better. In fact, I may experience negative side effects or even worsen my condition.\n\nTherefore, Answer: no, taking expired medication will not make me feel better. It is important to always check the expiration date of any medication before taking it and to discard any that have expired.",
