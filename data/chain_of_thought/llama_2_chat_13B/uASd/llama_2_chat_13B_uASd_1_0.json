But, will it completely extinguish the flame if the match does light? \ud83d\udd25\n\nHmmm... I'm not sure about that. If the match is struck while it's still submerged in water, then it's possible that the flame may not ignite at all. But if the match is struck while it's partially or mostly out of the water, then there's a chance that the flame may still light even though the match is wet.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, I would say... \ud83e\udd14\n\nAnswer: no. We cannot infer that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light. The outcome is not guaranteed, and there are too many variables at play here.",
