However, if the transmission is shot, it means that there is a problem with the gears or other internal components that are preventing the car from shifting properly.\n\nChanging the oil will not fix a faulty transmission. In fact, if the transmission is already damaged, changing the oil may not make much of a difference because the root cause of the problem is still present.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that if I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will not run smoothly.\n\nAnswer: no",
