The pilot light is not necessary for the oven to be on, as some modern ovens do not have pilot lights. However, if the pilot light is out, it means that the oven is not functioning properly and cannot heat up the kitchen.\n\nSo, if the oven is on but the pilot light is out, then it is unlikely that the kitchen is warm. In fact, it is possible that the kitchen may be colder than usual because the oven is not functioning properly.\n\nAnswer: no",
