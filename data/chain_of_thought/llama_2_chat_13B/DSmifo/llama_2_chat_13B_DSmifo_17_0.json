The sentence \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" implies that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n2. The sentence \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" states that one of two things must be true: either the scarf is on the coat rack, or it is in my backpack.\n3.
