Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nI want to find out if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This means that it must be in the box, right? Because if it were on the floor, it would be blending in.\n\nBut wait, we also know that either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box. So, if it's not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box!\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
