On my desk\n2. In my bag\n3. Somewhere else (e.g., in a drawer, on a shelf, etc.)\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nSo, if we combine the two premises, we can conclude that:\n\n1. If the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n2. The pen might not be on my desk (because it might be somewhere else).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
