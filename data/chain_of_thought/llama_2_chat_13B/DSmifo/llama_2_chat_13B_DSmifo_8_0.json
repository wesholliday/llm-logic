The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not hidden under the couch, but it does not necessarily mean that it is on the coffee table.\n2. The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" means that if the remote control is not hidden under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the remote control is not hidden under the couch, then it is likely to be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
