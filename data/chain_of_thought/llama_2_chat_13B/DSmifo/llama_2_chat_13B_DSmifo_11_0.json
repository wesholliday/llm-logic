This means that there are two possible scenarios: either the newspaper is sitting on the porch, or it is not.\n\nIf the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in one of the other locations mentioned - the driveway or somewhere else.\n\nNow, we also know that either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway. This means that if the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nSo, putting all of this together, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
