Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n\nI want to find out if we can infer that the phone is in the living room based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen (since we know it might not be). This means that the phone must be ringing in either the living room or some other location.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" If the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it must be ringing in the living room (since that's the only other option).\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
