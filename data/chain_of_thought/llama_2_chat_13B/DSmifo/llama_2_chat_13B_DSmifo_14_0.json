The milk is in the fridge. In this case, the statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" would be false, so we can eliminate this possibility.\n2. The milk is not in the fridge. In this case, the statement \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" would be true, and since we know that the milk is not in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
