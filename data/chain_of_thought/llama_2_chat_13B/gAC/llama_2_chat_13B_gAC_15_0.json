This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. We also know that 'Erin took a train' is true. This means that Erin did take a train.\n3. Based on the first premise, if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since Erin did take a train, it follows that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
