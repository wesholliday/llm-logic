We also know that the statement \"The banana was yellow\" is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" has a true antecedent (the apple was red) and a true consequent (the banana was yellow).\n4. Logically, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
