The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is also true, because we know that Sue was at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding.\n4. Since Sue was at the wedding, it follows that if Mary was at the wedding, then she would have been there too.\n\nAnswer: yes",
