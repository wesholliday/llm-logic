This means that if Alex finished the race, then it must be the case that Chris also finished the race.\n\nSecond, we know that 'Chris finished the race' is true. This means that Chris did finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for Alex. If Alex finished the race, then it must be the case that Chris also finished the race (by the first premise). And since Chris did finish the race (by the second premise), it follows that Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that 'Alex finished the race' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
