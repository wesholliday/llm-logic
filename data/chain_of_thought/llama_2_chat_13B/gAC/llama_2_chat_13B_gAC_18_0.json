            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. We know that 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true.\n2. We also know that 'The truck was metal' is true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is true for all possible values of the doll and truck.\n4. Since we know that the truck was metal, we can substitute this into the conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n5. Doing so, we get: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (true)'.\n6. Since the statement is true for all possible values of the doll and truck, we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the 'if') is true, i.e., the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
