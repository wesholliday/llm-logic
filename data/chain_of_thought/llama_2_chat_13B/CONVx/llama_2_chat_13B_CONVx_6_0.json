We can infer that \"sploffed\" is a verb, and \"plopped\" is also a verb.\n3. Based on the structure of the sentence, we can see that the two verbs are in a cause-and-effect relationship, where \"sploffed\" is the cause and \"plopped\" is the effect.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that if the grommet plopped the frink, it must have been sploffed first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
