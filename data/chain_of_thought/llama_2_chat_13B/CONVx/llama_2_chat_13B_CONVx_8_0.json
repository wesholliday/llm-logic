            "content": "Okay! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies that if the sprocket is in a certain state (cranked), it must be in another state (dagged) as well.\n2. Therefore, if we assume that the sprocket was daggled, we can infer that it must have been cranked at some point, since the two states are linked by the \"then\" clause.\n3. So, if the sprocket was daggled, it is reasonable to conclude that it was also cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
