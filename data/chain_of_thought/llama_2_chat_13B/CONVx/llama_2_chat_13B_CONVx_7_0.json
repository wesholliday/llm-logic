The sentence \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" implies that there is a causal relationship between being shanked and tinking.\n2. If we assume that the whiffle tinked, then it must have been caused to do so by something.\n3. The only thing that can cause a whiffle to tink is being shanked.\n4. Therefore, if the whiffle tinked, then it must have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
