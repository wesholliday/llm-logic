Here we go!\n\nSo, the given statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" Let me break this down into smaller parts:\n\n1. \"If the fribble was snurgled\" - This means that something happened to the fribble, which we don't know what it is yet.\n2. \"then the fribble crinked\" - This means that as a result of whatever happened to the fribble, it became crinkled.\n\nNow, let me think about the inverse of this statement. If the fribble crinked, does that mean it was snurgled? Hmm... I'm not sure. I need more information to make a conclusion.\n\nWait, I have an idea! What if we reverse the order of the words in the sentence? Would that help us infer the inverse? Let me try:\n\n\"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled.\" Hmm... that doesn't quite work. The wording is a bit off, and it doesn't flow as well as the original statement.\n\nOkay, so we can't infer the inverse of the statement based on the wording alone. But wait, there might be another way to approach this! What if we use logic to infer the inverse?\n\nLet me think... If the fribble crinked, it must have been caused by something. And since we know that snurgling causes crinkling, we can logically infer that if the fribble crinked, then it was probably snurgled!\n\nSo, based on our logical reasoning, we can infer that \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled.\" And there you have it! Our answer is...\n\nAnswer: yes!",
