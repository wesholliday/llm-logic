We can break down the sentence into two parts: \"If the dreb was vroombed\" and \"then the dreb was spened\".\n3. The first part of the sentence \"If the dreb was vroombed\" implies that the dreb was in a certain state (vroomed).\n4. The second part of the sentence \"then the dreb was spened\" implies that something happened to the dreb as a result of being in that state (it was spened).\n5. Based on the wording of the sentence, it seems that the order of events is important: the dreb must be vroomed before it can be spened.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that if the dreb was spened, then it must have been vroomed first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
