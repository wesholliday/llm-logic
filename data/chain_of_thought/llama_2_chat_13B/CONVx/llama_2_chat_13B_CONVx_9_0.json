If we say \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked,\" we are saying that if the twonk was varnished, then it must have been plinked.\n\nHmmm... this seems to be logically equivalent to the original statement. So, I think we can infer that if the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
