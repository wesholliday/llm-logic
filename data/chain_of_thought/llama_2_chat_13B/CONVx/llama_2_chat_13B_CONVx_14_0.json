In order for the condition to be true, the clug must have been fleeked.\n3. If the clug was fleeked, then it must have had the quality of being fleeked.\n4. Therefore, if the clug snugged, it must have been because it was fleeked.\n\nSo, based on these steps, we can infer that if the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
