We can infer that \"bluttered\" and \"surned\" are related words, possibly synonyms or opposites.\n3. Let's assume that \"bluttered\" means \"happy\" and \"surned\" means \"angry\".\n4. If the fleeg was happy (bluttered), then it would not be angry (surned).\n5. Therefore, if the fleeg surned, then it must have been bluttered before.\n\nAnswer: yes",
