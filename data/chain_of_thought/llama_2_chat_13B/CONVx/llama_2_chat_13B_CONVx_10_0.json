Here we go!\n\nSo, the premise is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This means that if the wug was subjected to the action of sproinging, then it must have been garpled as well.\n\nNow, let's think about the inverse of this statement. If the wug was garpled, does that mean it was also sproinged? Well, if we assume that being garpled is a necessary condition for being sproinged (i.e., you can't be sproinged without first being garpled), then we can infer that if the wug was garpled, then it must have been sproinged as well.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we can infer that \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged.\" And the answer is...\n\nAnswer: yes",
