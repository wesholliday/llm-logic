From this information, we can infer that either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are not lined up by the door (this is a logical contradiction, so we know one of these statements must be false).\n3. The statement \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet\" is given.\n4. If the shoes were lined up by the door, then they would not be in the closet (this is a logical contradiction, so we know this statement must be false).\n5. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
