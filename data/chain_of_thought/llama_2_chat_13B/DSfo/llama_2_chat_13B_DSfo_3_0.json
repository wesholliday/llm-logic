This means that they must be either in the drawer or somewhere else.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\" This statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the keys: either they are in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. Since we have already established that the keys are not in the cabinet, it follows that they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
