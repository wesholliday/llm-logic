Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nI want to find out if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box. If it's not in the box, then it must be blending in on the floor, since that's the only other option given by statement 2. But if it's blending in on the floor, then it wouldn't be missing, because we would see it on the floor.\n\nSo, if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be a contradiction, which means that our assumption that it's not in the box must be false. Therefore, the missing puzzle piece must be in the box!\n\nAnswer: yes",
