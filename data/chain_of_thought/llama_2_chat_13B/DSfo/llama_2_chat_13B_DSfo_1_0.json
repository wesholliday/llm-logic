This statement tells us that either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside the house.\n\nIf Fido were in the garden, then we would have already known this based on the first statement 'Fido is not in the garden'. Therefore, the only possible conclusion we can draw is that Fido must be inside the house.\n\nSo, Answer: yes.",
