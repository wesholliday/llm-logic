Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the flugel must have been blimmed. In other words, the absence of evidence for the flugel being blimmed does not necessarily mean that it was blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
