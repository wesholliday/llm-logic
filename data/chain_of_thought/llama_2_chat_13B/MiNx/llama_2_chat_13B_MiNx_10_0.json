Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The wug might not have been sproinged\" implies that there is a possibility that the wug was not sproinged. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the wug must have been sproinged. In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the wug was sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
