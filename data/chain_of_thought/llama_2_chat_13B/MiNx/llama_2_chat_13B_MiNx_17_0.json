Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" implies that the possibility of the flob being skizzled is uncertain or unknown. If we infer that the flob must have been skizzled, then we are assuming that the possibility of the flob being skizzled is certain, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flob must have been skizzled based on the statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\". Instead, we can only conclude that the possibility of the flob being skizzled is uncertain or unknown.\n\nAnswer: no",
