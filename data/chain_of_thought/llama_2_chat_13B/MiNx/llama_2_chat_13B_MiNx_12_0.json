Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The smip might not have been shripped\" implies that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the smip must have been shripped. In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the smip was shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped.\" This inference is based on the fact that we cannot rule out the possibility that the smip was not shripped, given the lack of evidence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
