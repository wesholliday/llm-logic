This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the flug must have been blummed. In other words, the absence of evidence for the flug being blummed does not necessarily mean that it was blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
