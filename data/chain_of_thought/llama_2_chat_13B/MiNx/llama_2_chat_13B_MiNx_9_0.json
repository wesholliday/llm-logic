Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The twonk might not have been plinked\" implies that there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the twonk must have been plinked. In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the twonk was plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
