This means that the opposite of the statement, \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroomed,\" is also true. In other words, if the dreb might not have been vroomed, then it's not necessarily the case that it must have been vroomed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
