Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" implies that the possibility of the fribble being snurgled is uncertain or unknown. If we assume that the fribble must have been snurgled, then we are making an assumption about the certainty of the situation, which is not supported by the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fribble must have been snurgled based on the statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\". Instead, we can only conclude that the possibility of the fribble being snurgled is uncertain or unknown.\n\nAnswer: no",
