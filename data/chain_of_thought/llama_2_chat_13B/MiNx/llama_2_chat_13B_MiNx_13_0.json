This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the glip was slogged.\n\nIf we cannot conclude with certainty that the glip was slogged, then it is also possible that the glip was not slogged. In other words, the absence of evidence that the glip was slogged does not necessarily mean that the glip was slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\". This is because there is no evidence to suggest that the glip was definitely slogged, and therefore it is possible that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
