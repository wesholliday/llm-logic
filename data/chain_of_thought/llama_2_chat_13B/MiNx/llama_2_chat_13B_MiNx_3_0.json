Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The splat might not have been morphed\" implies that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the splat was morphed.\n\nIf we cannot conclude with certainty that the splat was morphed, then it is also possible that the splat was not morphed. In other words, the absence of evidence for the splat being morphed does not necessarily mean that it was morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\" This inference is based on the fact that we cannot rule out the possibility that the splat was not morphed, and therefore we cannot conclude with certainty that it was morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
