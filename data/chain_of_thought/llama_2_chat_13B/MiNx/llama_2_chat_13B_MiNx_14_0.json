Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" implies that the possibility of the clug being fleeked is uncertain or unknown. If we assume that the clug must have been fleeked if it was indeed fleeked, then we can infer that the clug might not have been fleeked if it was not fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
