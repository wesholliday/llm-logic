Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the fleeg must have been bluttered. In other words, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\". This inference is based on the fact that we cannot rule out the possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered, and therefore we cannot assume that it must have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
