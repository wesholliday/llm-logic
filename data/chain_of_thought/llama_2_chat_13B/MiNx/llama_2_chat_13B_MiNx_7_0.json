Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" implies that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked. This means that the opposite of \"the whiffle must have been shanked\" is true, which is \"it's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\".\n\nSo, based on the given statement, we can infer that it's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
