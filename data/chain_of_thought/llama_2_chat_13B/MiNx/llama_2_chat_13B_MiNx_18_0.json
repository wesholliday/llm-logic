Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"The shank might not have been plooked\" implies that there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the shank was plooked.\n\nIf we cannot conclude with certainty that the shank was plooked, then it is also possible that the shank was not plooked. In other words, the absence of evidence that the shank was plooked does not necessarily mean that the shank was plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from \"The shank might not have been plooked\" that it is not the case that the shank must have been plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
