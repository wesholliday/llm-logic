The statement \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\" means that it is not true that the wolf must have been in the den.\n3. If the wolf must have been in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave (based on the first premise).\n4. Therefore, if the wolf must have been in the den, and it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den, then the bear must not have been in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
