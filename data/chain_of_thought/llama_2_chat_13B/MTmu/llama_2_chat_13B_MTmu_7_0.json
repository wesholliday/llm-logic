It's not the case that Chris must have finished the face (this is the second premise we are given)\n\nNow, let's think about what these two premises together mean. If Alex finished the race, then it means that Chris also finished the race, since \"if A then B\" implies that B must happen if A happens. However, we are also told that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the face. This means that there is no guarantee that Chris finished the race, even if Alex did finish.\n\nSo, based on these two premises, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. If Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well, but since it's not the case that Chris must have finished the face, it means that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
