It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. Here's why:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest (based on statement 1).\n\nBut we know that the unicorn must not have been in the forest (based on statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
