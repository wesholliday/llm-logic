It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIf Jeff had played basketball, then it would be true that Amy must have played tennis (based on the first statement). But since the second statement says that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis, we know that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
