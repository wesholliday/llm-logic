It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. Here's why:\n\nIf Tom had watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball because of the conditional statement in point 1. However, since it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (point 2), we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
