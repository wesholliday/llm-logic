The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, so we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, since Sue was at the wedding, it follows that if Mary was at the wedding, then she would have been there with Sue.\n4. So, based on the information provided, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but we cannot necessarily conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
