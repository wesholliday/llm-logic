This means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. We also know that the statement \"The banana was yellow\" is true. This means that the banana is indeed yellow.\n3. Based on the first two statements, we can conclude that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. But we don't know for sure whether the apple was actually red or not.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the apple was red just because the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
