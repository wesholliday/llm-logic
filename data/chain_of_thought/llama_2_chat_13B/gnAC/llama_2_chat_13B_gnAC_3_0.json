            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. We know that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true (this is given).\n2. We also know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true (this is given).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true.\n4. However, we are asked whether it necessarily follows that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n5. To determine this, we need to consider the possibility that there might be other books that are mystery novels but were not written by James.\n6. If such books exist, then it would not be the case that 'The book was written by James' implies 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n7. However, since we are given that 'The book is a mystery novel', we can infer that there is no such possibility (i.e., there are no other mystery novels that were not written by James).\n8. Therefore, it does necessarily follow that 'The book was written by James' is true, given the truth of the other two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
