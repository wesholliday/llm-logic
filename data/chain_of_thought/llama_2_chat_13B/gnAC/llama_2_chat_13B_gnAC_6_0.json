However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza.\n\nWait a minute... I think I see where this is going. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, but we only know that Bob chose pasta, not that Sue chose pizza. So, it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, and Bob still would have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: no. It does not necessarily follow that Sue chose pizza, even though Bob chose pasta if Sue chose pizza.",
