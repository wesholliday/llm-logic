This means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nSecond, we know that \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is true. This means that the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's think about what this tells us about the alien. If the robot visited Jupiter, then it must have been because the alien visited Mars. This is based on the fact that the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is true.\n\nSo, if we know that the robot visited Jupiter and we know that the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is true, then it logically follows that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
