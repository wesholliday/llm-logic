This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nSecond, we know that Amy played tennis. This means that Amy did play tennis.\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies for Jeff. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis. But we already know that Amy did play tennis, so it follows that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that Jeff did play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
