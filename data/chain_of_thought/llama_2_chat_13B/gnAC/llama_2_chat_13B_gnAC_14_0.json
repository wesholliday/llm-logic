The premise 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' states that if B (the bear) is true, then W (the wolf) is true.\n3. Therefore, if we assume that B is true (i.e., the bear was in the cave), then we can conclude that W is true (i.e., the wolf was in the den).\n4. So, if we assume that the bear was in the cave, it necessarily follows that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
