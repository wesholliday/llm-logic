This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside.\n2. We also know that 'The cat was outside' is true. This means that the cat is indeed outside.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside. Since the cat is already known to be outside, it follows that the dog must also be outside.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The dog was outside' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
