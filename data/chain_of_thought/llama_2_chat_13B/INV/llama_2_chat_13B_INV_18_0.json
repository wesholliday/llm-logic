If the doll was not plastic, then we can infer that the truck was not metal. This is because the statement only implies a relationship between the doll and the truck when the doll is made of plastic. If the doll is not plastic, then there is no reason to believe that the truck is metal.\n\nTherefore, the inference we can draw from the given statement is \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
