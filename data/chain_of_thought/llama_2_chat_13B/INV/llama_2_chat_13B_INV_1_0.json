This statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding.\n3. If we negate the first statement (i.e., assume that Mary did not attend the wedding), we get:\n4. If Mary did not attend the wedding, then Sue did not attend the wedding.\n5. This statement logically follows from the original premise, as if Mary did not attend the wedding, it is certain that Sue did not attend either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
