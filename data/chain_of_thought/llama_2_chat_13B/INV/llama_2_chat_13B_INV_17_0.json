However, it does not imply that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n4. In other words, the statement only tells us what would happen if Ben did eat pasta, but it does not tell us what would happen if he did not eat pasta.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
