The premise is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. The contrapositive of this premise is \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then it is certain that Amy did not play tennis.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
