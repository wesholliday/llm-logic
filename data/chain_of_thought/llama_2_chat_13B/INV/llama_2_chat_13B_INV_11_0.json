The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins.\n2. If the cake was not chocolate, then it must be a different type of cake (e.g. vanilla, red velvet, etc.).\n3. Since the type of cake determines the type of muffins, if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry.\n\nTherefore, the inference we can make is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
