This statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n3. However, it does not imply that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n4. In other words, the statement only tells us about the relationship between Tom and Jen's activities when they do watch football, but it does not provide any information about what happens when they don't watch football.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
