The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck.\n2. If the car was not red, then it must be a different color.\n3. If the car is not red, then it is not possible for the truck to be blue, because the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" only applies when the car is red.\n4. Therefore, if the car was not red, then the truck must not be blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
