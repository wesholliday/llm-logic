To do this, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nIf there is a drought, it is unlikely that the lawn will be lush and green, regardless of whether or not it is fertilized. This is because droughts are characterized by a lack of water, which is essential for healthy plant growth. Therefore, the premise \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green\" does not guarantee that the conclusion \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" will be true.\n\nIn fact, the conclusion is likely to be false, as fertilizing the lawn during a drought may even harm the lawn further by encouraging excessive growth that cannot be sustained by the limited water available.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, and the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
