If my computer catches on fire, it doesn't matter if I have finished my homework or not. The fact that my computer is on fire means that I cannot play video games period. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games\" is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
