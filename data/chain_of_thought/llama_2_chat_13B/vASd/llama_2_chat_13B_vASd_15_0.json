In other words, we need to ask ourselves if it is true that if I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, then it will have power.\n\nWell, it seems to me that this is indeed true. If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, then charging it will certainly result in it having power. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
