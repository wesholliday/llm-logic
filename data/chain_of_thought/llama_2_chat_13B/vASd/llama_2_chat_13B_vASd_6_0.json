The premise states that screaming will hurt the listener's ears.\n2. The conclusion states that screaming and wearing earplugs will also hurt the listener's ears.\n3. The conclusion logically follows from the premise, as wearing earplugs does not negate the fact that screaming can still cause discomfort or pain to the ears.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
