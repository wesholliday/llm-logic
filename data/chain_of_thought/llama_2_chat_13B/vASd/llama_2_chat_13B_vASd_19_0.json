Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run.\" This is a true statement, as filling up the gas tank is a necessary condition for the car to run.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run.\" This conclusion logically follows from the premise, because even if there is a hole in the gas tank, the car will still be able to run as long as there is enough gasoline in the tank.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
