This is given in the statement \"the bear was in the cave.\"\n\nSecond, we know that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is given in the statement \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nSo, we have two statements:\n\n1. The bear was in the cave.\n2. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nCan we infer that the wolf was in the den? Let's think about it...\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then it must have been in the den at some point, since the den is inside the cave. Therefore, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den at some point as well.\n\nSo, based on the information we have, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
