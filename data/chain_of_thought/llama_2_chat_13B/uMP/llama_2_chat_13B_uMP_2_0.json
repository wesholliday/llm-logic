This means that if the griffin is true (i.e., it is in the forest), then the unicorn must also be true (i.e., it is in the forest).\n2. The statement also says that the griffin was in the forest. This means that the griffin is true, and therefore the unicorn must also be true (according to the first statement).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
