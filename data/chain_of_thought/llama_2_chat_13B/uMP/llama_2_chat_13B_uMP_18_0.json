Also, the doll was plastic.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the doll was plastic. The given information is that the doll was plastic. So, the first part of the if-then statement is true.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part of the if-then statement: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since the first part of the statement is true (the doll was plastic), we can infer that the second part of the statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
