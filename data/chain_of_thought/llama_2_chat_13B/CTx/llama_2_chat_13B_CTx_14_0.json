The sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" implies that there is a direct relationship between being fleeked and snuggling.\n2. If we assume that the clug did not snugge (i.e., the clug did not engage in snuggling behavior), then we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n3. This is because the sentence establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between being fleeked and snuggling, such that if the clug did not snugge, it must not have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
