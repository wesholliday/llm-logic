Here we go!\n\nSo, the given statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" Let me break this down into smaller parts:\n\n1. If the fribble was snurgled: This means that something happened to the fribble, and we don't know what that something is.\n2. Then the fribble crinked: This means that as a result of whatever happened to the fribble, it became crinked.\n\nNow, let me think about the inverse of this statement. If the fribble did not crink, then we can infer that it was not snurgled. Why is that? Well, if the fribble had been snurgled and it didn't become crinked, then something must have prevented it from becoming crinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we can infer that if the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
