This means that if the shank was plooked (i.e., if the shank had a certain characteristic), then it must have been nugged (i.e., it must have had another characteristic).\n3. Therefore, if the shank was not nugged, then it cannot have been plooked.\n4. This means that the negation of \"the shank was nugged\" implies the negation of \"the shank was plooked\".\n5. So, we can infer that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
