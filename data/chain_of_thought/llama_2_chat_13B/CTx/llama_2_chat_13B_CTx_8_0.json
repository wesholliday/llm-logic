The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies that if the sprocket is in a certain state (cranked), it must also be in another state (dagged).\n2. This means that if the sprocket is not dagged, it cannot be cranked.\n3. Therefore, if the sprocket was not daggled, it must not have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
