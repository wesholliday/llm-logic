If the grommet was sploffed...\n2. ...then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's think about what this sentence is saying. If the grommet was sploffed (which means it was blown or propelled), then it must have done something as a result of that action. In this case, the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nSo, if we reverse the sentence and assume that the grommet did not plop the frink, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed. This is because if the grommet had not been sploffed, it would not have been able to plop the frink.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
