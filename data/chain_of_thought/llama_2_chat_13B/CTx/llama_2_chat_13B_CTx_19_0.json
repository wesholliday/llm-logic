The sentence \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" implies that there is a causal relationship between being vreebled and plagging.\n2. This means that if the smonk was vreebled, it must have plagged.\n3. Therefore, if the smonk did not plagged, it cannot be vreebled.\n4. So, we can infer that if the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
