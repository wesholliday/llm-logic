The sentence \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" implies that there is a direct relationship between being shanked and tinking.\n2. If the whiffle did not tink, then it must not have been shanked, because if it were shanked, it would have tinked.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
