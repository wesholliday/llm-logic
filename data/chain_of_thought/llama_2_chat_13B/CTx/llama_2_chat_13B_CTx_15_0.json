This means that if the dreb was vroombed (i.e., if it underwent a certain process), then it must have been spened (i.e., it must have undergone another process).\n3. Therefore, if the dreb was not spened, then it cannot have been vroombed.\n4. Conversely, if the dreb was not vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n5. So, we can infer that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
