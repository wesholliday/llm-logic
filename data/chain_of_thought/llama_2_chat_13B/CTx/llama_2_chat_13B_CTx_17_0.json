This means that if the flob was skizzled, it must have moved. (logical conclusion from the given statement)\n3. Therefore, if the flob did not move, then it was not skizzled. (negation of the previous statement)\n4. So, if the flob did not movate, then we can infer that it was not skizzled. (final conclusion)\n\nAnswer: yes",
