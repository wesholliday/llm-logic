The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" implies that being sproinged is a necessary condition for being garpled.\n2. If the wug was not garpled, then it does not meet the necessary condition of being sproinged.\n3. Therefore, if the wug was not garpled, it must not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
