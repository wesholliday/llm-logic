So, if the sneg was crampled, it means it was compressed or packed tightly.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part of the given statement: \"then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nThe word \"sproted\" is a made-up word, so we can't infer anything from it. However, if we assume that \"sproted\" means \"sprouted\" or \"grew\", then we can infer that if the sneg was crampled, it might have sprouted or grown something.\n\nNow, let's think about the inverse of the given statement: \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nIf the sneg did not sprout or grow anything, then it must not have been compressed or packed tightly (i.e., it was not crampled).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \ud83d\ude0a",
