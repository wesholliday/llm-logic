We know that the shoes are not lined up by the door, because the statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\" is true.\n2. We also know that either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door, because this is a logical necessity given the two statements we have.\n3. If the shoes are not in the closet, then they must be lined up by the door (by the logic of the second statement).\n4. However, we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door, so it follows that they must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
