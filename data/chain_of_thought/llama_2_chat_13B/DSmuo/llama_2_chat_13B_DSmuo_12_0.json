We know that the jacket is not hanging in the closet (given by the premise \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\").\n2. We also know that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet (given by the premise \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\").\n3. If the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair (by the second premise).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
