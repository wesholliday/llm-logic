We know that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, because the statement says \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n2. We also know that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf, because this is what the second statement says.\n3. If the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be sitting on the bookshelf (by the first statement).\n4. But we already know that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf (from point 1), so it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
