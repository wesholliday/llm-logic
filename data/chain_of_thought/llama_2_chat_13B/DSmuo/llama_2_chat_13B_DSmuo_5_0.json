This means that they must be somewhere else, like in a jar or on a plate.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\" This statement is saying that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry. But we just established that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, so the only option left is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
