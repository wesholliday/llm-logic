The statement \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" means that it is possible for the umbrella to be somewhere other than in the closet.\n2. The statement \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\" means that the umbrella cannot be both in the car and tucked away in the closet at the same time.\n3. Therefore, if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
