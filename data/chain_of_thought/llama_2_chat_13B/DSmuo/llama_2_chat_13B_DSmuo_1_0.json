This means that Fido has the freedom to choose whether or not to be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This premise tells us that there are only two possible states for Fido: either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nGiven the first premise, we know that Fido is not required to be in the garden. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nSo, based on the given premises, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
