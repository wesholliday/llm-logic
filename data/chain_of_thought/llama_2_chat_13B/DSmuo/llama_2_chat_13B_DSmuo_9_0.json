The statement \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" means that it is not possible for the missing puzzle piece to be on the floor and still be hidden from view.\n2. The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\" means that the missing puzzle piece must either be in the box or it must be on the floor and hidden from view.\n3. If the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be on the floor and hidden from view (based on point 2).\n4. However, we have already established that it is not possible for the missing puzzle piece to be on the floor and still be hidden from view (based on point 1).\n5. Therefore, the only possibility left is that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
