The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" means that there is no requirement for the scarf to be draped on the coat rack.\n2. The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" means that either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it has to be draped on the coat rack. There is no third option.\n3. If the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
