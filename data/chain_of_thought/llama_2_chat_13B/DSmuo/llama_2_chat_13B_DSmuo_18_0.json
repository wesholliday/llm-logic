We know that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, because the statement says \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. We also know that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand, because this is another statement we were given.\n3. If the notebook is not in the drawer, then it must be sitting on the nightstand (by the second statement).\n4. But we already established that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, so it must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
