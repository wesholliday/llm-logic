The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" means that one of two things is true: either the remote control is on the coffee table, or it is hiding under the couch.\n3. Since we know that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, the only other option is that it is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
