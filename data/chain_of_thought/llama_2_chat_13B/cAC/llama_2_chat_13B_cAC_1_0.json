The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n3. Therefore, if we know that Sue was at the wedding, and we know that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" implies that Sue was at the wedding, then we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
