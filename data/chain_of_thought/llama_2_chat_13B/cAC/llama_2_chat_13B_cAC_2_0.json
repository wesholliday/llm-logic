The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nCan we conclude that the griffin was in the forest?\n\nWell, if the first statement is true (i.e., if the griffin was in the forest), then the second statement must also be true (i.e., the unicorn was in the forest). And since we know that the unicorn was in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
