We know that \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if one part of the sentence is true, then the other part must also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"The bear was in the cave.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is true - the bear was in the cave.\n3. Therefore, based on the conditional statement, we can infer that the second part of the sentence must also be true. In other words, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
