We know that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"The car was red.\" This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n3. Therefore, based on the truth of the antecedent, we can infer that the consequent of the conditional statement is also true. In other words, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
