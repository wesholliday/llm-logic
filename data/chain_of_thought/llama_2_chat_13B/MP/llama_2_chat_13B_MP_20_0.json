The sentence \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana must have had the property of being yellow.\n3. Therefore, based on the information we know about the apple, we can infer that the banana also had the property of being yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
