            "content": "Okay! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. We know that the shirt was cotton, so we can say that the shirt was made of cotton fabric.\n2. The sentence \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothetical situation is that the shirt was cotton, and the consequence is that the pants were denim.\n3.
