The sentence \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part of the sentence (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the second part of the sentence (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n3. Therefore, since we know that the griffin was in the forest, we can infer that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
