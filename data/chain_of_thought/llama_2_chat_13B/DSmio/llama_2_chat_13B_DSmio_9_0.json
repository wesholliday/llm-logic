Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nI want to find out if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\" This statement suggests that the missing puzzle piece might not be visible or noticeable on the floor, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's not in the box.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\" This statement is a logical contradiction to the first statement, because if the missing puzzle piece is in the box, then it cannot be blending in on the floor.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box!\n\nAnswer: yes",
