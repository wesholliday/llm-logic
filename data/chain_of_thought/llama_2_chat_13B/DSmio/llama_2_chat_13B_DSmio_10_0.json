If the missing sock is in the laundry basket, then it cannot be under the bed, because we already know that it is not under the bed. Therefore, if the missing sock is in the laundry basket, we can infer that it must be in the laundry basket and nowhere else.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
