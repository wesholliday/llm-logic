Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nI'm going to assume that the first statement is true, meaning that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. This means that the cookies must be in the jar, since they cannot be both in the pantry and in the jar at the same time.\n\nNow, let me check if this conclusion follows logically from the two statements. If the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar or somewhere else. However, we know that they cannot be anywhere else since we have already established that they are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the only possible location for the cookies is the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
