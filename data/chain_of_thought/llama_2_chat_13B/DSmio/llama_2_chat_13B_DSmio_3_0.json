This is a logical contradiction, so we know that one of these statements must be false.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
