This means that if the newspaper is not in the driveway, then it must be sitting on the porch.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. To answer this, we need to consider the possibility that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. If the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway, because that's the only other option.\n\nSo, if the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch, then we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. This makes sense, because if the newspaper isn't on the porch, it's more likely to be in the driveway than anywhere else.\n\nAnswer: yes",
