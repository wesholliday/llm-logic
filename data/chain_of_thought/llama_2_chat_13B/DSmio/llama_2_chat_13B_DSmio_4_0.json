The cat is napping on the couch: If the cat is napping on the couch, then it cannot be playing in the bedroom, since it is not possible for the cat to be doing both activities at the same time. Therefore, if the cat is napping on the couch, we can infer that it is not playing in the bedroom.\n2. The cat is playing in the bedroom: If the cat is playing in the bedroom, then it cannot be napping on the couch, since it is not possible for the cat to be doing both activities at the same time. Therefore, if the cat is playing in the bedroom, we can infer that it is not napping on the couch.\n\nNow, based on the information provided, we know that the cat must be either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. Since we have already considered both possibilities and ruled out the possibility of the cat being in both locations at once, we can conclude that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
