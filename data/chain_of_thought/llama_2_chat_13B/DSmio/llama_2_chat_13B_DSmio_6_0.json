We also know that either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n3. If the phone is in the living room, then it must not be ringing in the kitchen (because it's already in the living room).\n4. Therefore, if the phone is in the living room, we can infer that it is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nNow, based on these premises, can I conclude that the phone is in the living room?\n\nAnswer: yes",
