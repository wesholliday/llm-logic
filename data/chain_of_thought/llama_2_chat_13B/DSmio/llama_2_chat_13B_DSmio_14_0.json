Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nI want to find out if we can infer that the milk is on the counter based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This means that it must be on the counter because there is no other place for it to be.\n\nNow, let's combine this information with the second statement: Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. Since we have already established that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
