In other words, if the pen is not in my bag, we can conclude that it is on my desk.\n\nSo, let's apply this reasoning to our original premises. If the pen might not be on my desk, and either it is in my bag or it must be on my desk, then we can infer that if the pen is not on my desk, it must be in my bag. In other words, if the pen is not on my desk, we can conclude that it is in my bag.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"From 'The pen might not be on my desk' together with 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk', can we infer 'The pen is in my bag'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
