This means that Fido could be inside the house or somewhere else outside of the garden.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside the house.\n\nSo, putting both statements together, we can infer that if Fido might not be in the garden, then he must be inside the house. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
