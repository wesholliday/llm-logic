Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" means that one of these two things must be true. Let's consider each possibility:\n\n1. The jacket is draped over the chair: If this is the case, then the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, because it would be physically impossible for it to be in both places at once. Therefore, if the jacket is draped over the chair, it must not be hanging in the closet.\n2. The jacket must be hanging in the closet: If the jacket is not draped over the chair, then it must be hanging in the closet. But this cannot be true, because we were just told that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. Therefore, if the jacket must be hanging in the closet, it cannot be true.\n\nConclusion: Since neither of these two possibilities can be true, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
