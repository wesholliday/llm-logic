This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be somewhere else, like on the floor.\n\nHowever, the statement also says that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means that even if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, it cannot be on the floor blending in with the other pieces.\n\nSo, if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be somewhere else, but it cannot be on the floor blending in with the other pieces. This means that the only possible location for the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, I can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
