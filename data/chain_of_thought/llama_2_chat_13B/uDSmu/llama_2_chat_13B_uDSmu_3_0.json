The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that one of two possibilities is true: either the keys are in the drawer, or they are hanging in the cabinet.\n2. It is not possible for the keys to be both in the drawer and dangling in the cabinet at the same time, so we can eliminate that possibility.\n3. The statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is not necessary for the keys to be hanging in the cabinet.\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is possible that the keys are in the drawer, but it is not necessary for them to be there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
