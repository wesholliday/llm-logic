The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that one of two possibilities is true: either Fido is inside the house, or Fido must be in the garden.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" means that Fido cannot be in the garden. This is a negative statement, so it means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n3. Therefore, based on the two statements above, we can infer that Fido must be inside the house.\n\nAnswer: yes",
