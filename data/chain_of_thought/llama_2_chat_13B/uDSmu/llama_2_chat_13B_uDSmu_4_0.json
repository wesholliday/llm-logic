The statement \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom\" means that one of these two options must be true.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" means that option 2 (the cat being in the bedroom) is not possible.\n3.
