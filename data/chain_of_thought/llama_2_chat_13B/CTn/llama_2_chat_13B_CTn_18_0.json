If the truck was made of metal, then what can we infer about the doll? Well, if the truck was made of metal, it means that the doll could not have been made of metal as well, since the statement tells us that the two objects cannot both be made of the same material.\n\nTherefore, if the truck was made of metal, then the doll must have been made of plastic. So, the inference we can draw is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
