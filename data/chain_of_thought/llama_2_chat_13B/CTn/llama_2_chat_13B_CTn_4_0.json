The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nWe want to infer whether the alien visited Mars based on these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the condition in statement 1 is false, since the robot did visit Jupiter. Therefore, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's assume that the alien visited Mars. This means that the condition in statement 1 is true, and the robot did not visit Jupiter. However, we already know that the robot did visit Jupiter, so this implies that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
