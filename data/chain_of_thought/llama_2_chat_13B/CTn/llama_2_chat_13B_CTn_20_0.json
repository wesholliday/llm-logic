If the banana was yellow, then what can we say about the apple? Well, if the banana was yellow, then we know that the apple cannot be red, because if it was red, then the banana would not be yellow.\n\nSo, the inverse of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
