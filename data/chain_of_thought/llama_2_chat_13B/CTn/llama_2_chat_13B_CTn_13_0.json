If the truck was blue, then what can we say about the car? Well, if the truck was blue, then the car cannot be red, because if the car was red, then the truck would not be blue.\n\nSo, the inverse of \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" is \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
