The statement \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" is logically equivalent to the statement \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad\". This is because if Kate ate the salad, it would mean that Ben did not eat pasta, and vice versa.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
