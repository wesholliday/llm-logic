If we negate the statement (i.e., assume that Mary was not at the wedding), then we get:\n\n\"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive statement:\n\n\"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nIs this statement true? Well, if Sue was at the wedding, then we know that Mary was not at the wedding (by the original statement). So, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
