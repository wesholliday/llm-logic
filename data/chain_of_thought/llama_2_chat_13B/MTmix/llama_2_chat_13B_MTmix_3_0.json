The splat might not have quanked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the splat was not morphed. Here's why:\n\n3. If the splat did not quank, then it cannot be morphed because morphing implies quanking.\n4. Therefore, if the splat might not have quanked, it must not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
