The flug might not have been zimmed (premise)\n3. If the flug was blummed and might not have been zimmed, then it is not the case that the flug was blummed (logical negation of 1 and 2)\n4. Therefore, the flug was not blummed (conclusion)\n\nSo, based on the given premises, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
