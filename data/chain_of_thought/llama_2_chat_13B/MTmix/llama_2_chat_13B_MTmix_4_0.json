The fribble might not have crinked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled. Here's why:\n\n3. If the fribble had been snurgled, it would have crinked.\n4. But since the fribble might not have crinked, it means that it did not get snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
