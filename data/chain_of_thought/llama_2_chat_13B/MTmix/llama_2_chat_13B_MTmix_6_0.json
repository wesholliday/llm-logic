The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed. This is because if the grommet had plopped the frink, it would have been impossible for the grommet to not have plopped the frink (i.e., the second statement would be false). Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
