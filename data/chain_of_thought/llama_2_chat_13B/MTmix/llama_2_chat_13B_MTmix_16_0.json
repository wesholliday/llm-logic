If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n2. The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n\nOkay, let's think about what these premises mean. Premise 1 is saying that if the sneg (whatever that is) was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. That means that if the sneg was in a cramped state, it must have had the ability to sprot the frink.\n\nNow, let's look at premise 2. This one says that the sneg might not have sproted the frink. This means that even if the sneg was in a cramped state, it might not have had the ability to sprot the frink.\n\nSo, what can we infer from these two premises? Well, if we combine them, we can see that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink (based on premise 1). But, we also know that the sneg might not have sproted the frink (based on premise 2).\n\nSo, what does this tell us? It tells us that the sneg was not crampled! That's because if it was crampled, it would have had to sprot the frink, but we know that it might not have done so. Therefore, the only possibility is that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
