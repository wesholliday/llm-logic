The smonk might not have plagged.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled if the second statement is true. This is because if the smonk had plagged, it would be impossible for the smonk to not have been vreebled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\nAnswer: no",
