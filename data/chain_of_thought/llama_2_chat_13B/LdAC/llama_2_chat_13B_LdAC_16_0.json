We also know that the pants were denim.\n\nSo, can we logically deduce that the shirt was cotton? Well, if the pants were denim and the shirt was cotton, then it must be the case that the shirt was cotton. This is because the premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would definitely be denim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information we have, we can logically deduce that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
