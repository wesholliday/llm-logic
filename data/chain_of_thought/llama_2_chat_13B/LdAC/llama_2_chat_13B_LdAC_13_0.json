This is because the word \"if\" implies a condition or hypothesis, and the phrase \"then the truck was blue\" specifies the consequence of that condition.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"The truck was blue\". This statement tells us that the truck is indeed blue, which means that the condition specified in the first premise (i.e., \"the car was red\") must have been true.\n\nTherefore, based on these two premises, we can logically deduce that the car was red. This conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, so the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
