If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (this is the given statement).\n3. Therefore, if we assume that Mary was not at the wedding, we can deduce that Sue was not at the wedding (based on the given statement).\n4. However, we are also given that Sue was at the wedding, so we cannot assume that Mary was not at the wedding.\n5. Therefore, we can logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
