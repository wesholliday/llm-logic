Chris finished the race.\n\nI need to determine if we can logically deduce that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\n2. Chris finished the race. This means that Chris did complete the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can deduce from these two statements. If Chris finished the race, then it must be true that Alex finished the race as well, because of statement 1. This is because if Alex had not finished the race, then Chris would not have finished the race either (since Alex not finishing the race would mean that Chris did not complete the race).\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can logically deduce that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
