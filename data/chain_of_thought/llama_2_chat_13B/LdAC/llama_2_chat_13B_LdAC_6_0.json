This is because the phrase \"if Sue chose pizza\" implies a causal relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n\nNow, we are also given that Bob chose pasta. This means that Bob did indeed choose pasta, regardless of what Sue chose.\n\nCan we logically deduce that Sue chose pizza? Well, if we assume that the premise \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, and we know that Bob chose pasta, then it follows that Sue must have chosen pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen something else, such as salad or soup, then Bob would not have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
