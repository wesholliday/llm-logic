This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is certain that the muffins were blueberry.\n3. However, the statement also says \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n4. This means that it is not true that the muffins must have been blueberry, even if the cake was chocolate.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate, because if it were, the muffins would have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
