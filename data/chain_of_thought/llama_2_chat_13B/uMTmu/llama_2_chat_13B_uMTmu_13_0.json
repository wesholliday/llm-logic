This means that if the premise of the statement (i.e., the car was red) is true, then the conclusion (i.e., the truck must have been blue) must also be true.\n3. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" tells us that the conclusion of the conditional statement (i.e., the truck must have been blue) is actually false.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the premise of the conditional statement (i.e., the car was red) must also be false.\n5. So, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
