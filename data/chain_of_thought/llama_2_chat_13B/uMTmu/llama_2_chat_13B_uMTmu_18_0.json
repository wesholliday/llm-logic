This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, but it's not necessarily true that the truck was metal even if the doll was plastic.\n3. The statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" tells us that the truck was not necessarily metal, even if the doll was plastic.\n4.
