It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's think about what these two statements mean. The first statement says that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe had gone to the park, it would be true that Lucy went to the zoo. However, the second statement says that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that even if Joe had gone to the park, it would not be true that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nSo, let's put these two statements together. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, but it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
