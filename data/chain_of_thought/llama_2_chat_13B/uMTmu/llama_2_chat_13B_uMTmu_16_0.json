This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would definitely be denim.\n3. However, the statement also says \"it's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\"\n4. This means that even if the shirt was cotton, it is not necessarily true that the pants were denim.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
