This statement is true because the text says \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n3. Therefore, if Ben ate pasta, it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n4. However, the text also states that \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n5. This means that there is no guarantee that Kate ate salad, even if Ben ate pasta.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
