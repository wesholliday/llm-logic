This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then the blue shirt would not be available for Mark to buy.\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is because we are only told that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but we are not told that Mark actually did buy the blue shirt.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if she had bought it, then Mark would not have been able to buy the blue shirt, and yet we are told that he must have bought it.\n\nAnswer: no",
