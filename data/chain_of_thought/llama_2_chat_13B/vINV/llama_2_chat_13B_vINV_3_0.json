Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" This means that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical validity of this argument. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement. If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nOn the other hand, the conclusion \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" is also a conditional statement. If the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel. This means that if the premise is false (i.e., the book was not written by James), then the conclusion must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can see that the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
