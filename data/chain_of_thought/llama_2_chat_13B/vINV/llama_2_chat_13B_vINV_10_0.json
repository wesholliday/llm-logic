The premise of the argument is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside the house, then the cat must have been outside.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This means that if the dog was not inside the house, then the cat cannot be outside.\n3. Now, let's assume that the premise is true. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n4. But wait, this implies that the conclusion is also true! If the dog was not inside, then the cat cannot be outside.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid, because it follows logically from the premise to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
