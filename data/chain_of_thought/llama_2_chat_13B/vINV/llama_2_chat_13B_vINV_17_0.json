Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nNow, let's think about what this conclusion implies. If Ben did not eat pasta, then it means that he did not eat anything with Kate. Therefore, if Ben did not eat pasta, it must be the case that Kate did not eat salad either, since she would have eaten it with Ben if he had eaten pasta.\n\nSo, the conclusion of the argument follows logically from the premise. If Ben did not eat pasta, then it is certain that Kate did not eat salad. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
