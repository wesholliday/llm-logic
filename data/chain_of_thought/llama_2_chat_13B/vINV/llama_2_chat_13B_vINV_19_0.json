            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The premise of the argument is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, then it is certain that Jen watched basketball.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This means that if Tom did not watch football, then it is certain that Jen did not watch basketball.\n3. Now, let's assume that Tom did not watch football. If this is true, then the premise of the argument (step 1) is false, since Tom did not watch football.\n4. Since the premise is false, we can conclude that the conclusion (step 2) is also false. This means that if Tom did not watch football, it is not certain that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
