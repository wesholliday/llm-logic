Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This means that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" This means that if Alex did not complete the race, then Chris did not complete the race either.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's assume that Alex finished the race. In this case, the premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true, because Alex did finish the race, and therefore Chris also finished the race.\n\nNow, let's assume that Alex did not finish the race. In this case, the conclusion \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race\" is true, because if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nSo, regardless of whether Alex finished the race or not, the conclusion of the argument is always true. This means that the argument is logically valid, because its conclusion follows logically from its premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
