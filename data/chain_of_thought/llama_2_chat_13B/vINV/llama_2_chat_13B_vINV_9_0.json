            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This implies that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, then Mark must have purchased the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This statement is saying that if Lisa did not purchase the red shirt, then it is not possible for Mark to have purchased the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the logical structure of the argument. The premise and conclusion are both conditional statements, which means they are both based on the idea that \"if\" something is true, then something else must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The conclusion states that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. These two statements are logically equivalent, meaning that they have the same logical structure.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it is based on a logical equivalence between the premise and conclusion. The conclusion logically follows from the premise, so the argument is sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
