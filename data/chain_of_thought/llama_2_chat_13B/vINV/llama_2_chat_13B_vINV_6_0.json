Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if Sue selected pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This means that if Sue did not select pizza, then Bob cannot have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical validity of this argument. To determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to ask ourselves whether it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (premise).\n\nBut what if Sue did not choose pizza? In that case, the premise is false, so we cannot conclude that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no.",
