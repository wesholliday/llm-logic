The premise of the argument is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if Jeff played basketball, then it is true that Amy played tennis.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then it is false that Amy played tennis.\n3. Now, let's assume that Jeff did not play basketball. If this is true, then the premise of the argument (step 1) is false, since Jeff did not play basketball.\n4. Since the premise is false, we can conclude that the conclusion (step 2) is also false. This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then it is not true that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
