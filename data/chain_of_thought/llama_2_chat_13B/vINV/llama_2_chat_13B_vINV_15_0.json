Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam did take a plane, then it must be the case that Erin took a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then it cannot be the case that Erin took a train.\n\nSo, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. If Sam did not take a plane, then it is impossible for Erin to have taken a train, since the premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
