            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The premise of the argument is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple had been red, then the banana would have been yellow.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This means that if the apple had not been red, then the banana would not have been yellow.\n3. To determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to ask ourselves whether it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n4. If we assume that the apple was red, then the banana would have been yellow, so the premise is true. However, if we assume that the apple was not red, then the banana would not have been yellow, so the conclusion is also true.\n5. Therefore, we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
