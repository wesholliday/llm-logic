            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have also attended the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion of the argument: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This statement is saying that if Mary did not attend the wedding, then Sue cannot have attended the wedding either.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. Here's how I would break down the argument:\n\n1. The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, where the \"if\" clause (Mary was at the wedding) is connected to the \"then\" clause (Sue was at the wedding).\n2. The conclusion states that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is also a conditional statement, where the \"if\" clause (Mary was not at the wedding) is connected to the \"then\" clause (Sue was not at the wedding).\n3. The conclusion logically follows from the premise because if Mary did not attend the wedding, then it is certain that Sue did not attend the wedding as well. This is because the premise states that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue attended the wedding, and since Mary did not attend the wedding, it is impossible for Sue to have attended the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I conclude that the argument is logically valid because its conclusion logically follows from its premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
