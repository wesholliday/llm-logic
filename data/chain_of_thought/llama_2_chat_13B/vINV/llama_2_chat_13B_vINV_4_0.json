The premise of the argument is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This means that if the alien went to Mars, then the robot also went to Jupiter.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This means that if the alien did not go to Mars, then the robot did not go to Jupiter.\n3. Now, let's assume that the alien did not visit Mars. This means that the premise of the argument is false.\n4. If the premise is false, then the conclusion cannot be logically deduced. In other words, just because the alien did not visit Mars, it does not mean that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n5. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
