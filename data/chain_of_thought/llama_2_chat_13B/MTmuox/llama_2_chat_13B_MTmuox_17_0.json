From this premise, we can infer that \"the flob was not movated\" (this follows logically, since if it were not the case that the flob must have movated, then the flob cannot have been movated).\n3. Now, let's consider the second premise: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\"\n4. If we assume that the flob was skizzled, then we can infer that the flob must have movated (this follows logically, since if the flob was skizzled, then it must have been moved).\n5. However, we already know that the flob was not movated (from step 2), so we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
