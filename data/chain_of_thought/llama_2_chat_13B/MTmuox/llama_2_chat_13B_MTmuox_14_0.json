We know that \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that it is possible for the clug to exist without being snugged.\n2. We also know that \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that if the clug was fleeked (i.e., if it had a certain property), then it must have had the property of being snugged.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the clug is not fleeked, then it cannot be snugged. In other words, if the clug does not have the property of being fleeked, then it cannot have the property of being snugged either.\n4. Therefore, based on the first statement, we know that the clug is not snugged. And based on the second statement, we know that the clug is not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
