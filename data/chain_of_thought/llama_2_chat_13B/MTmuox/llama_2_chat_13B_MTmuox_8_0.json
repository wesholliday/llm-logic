The premise \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" means that it is possible for the sprocket to be in a state where it is not daggled.\n2. The premise \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" means that if the sprocket was in a state of being cranked, then it must also be in a state of being daggled.\n3. If we combine these two premises, we can infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it cannot have been cranked.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
