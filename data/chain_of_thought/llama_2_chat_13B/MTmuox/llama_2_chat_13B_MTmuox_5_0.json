We know that the zinger was not smoogled, because the statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled\" is true.\n2. If the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled, because the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\" is true.\n3.
