The statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\" means that it is possible for the grommet to have done so without being sploffed.\n2. The statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\" means that if the grommet was sploffed, then it is certain that the grommet plopped the frink.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the grommet was not sploffed, then it did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: no",
