The statement \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\" means that it is possible for the shank to exist without being nugged.\n2. The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\" means that if the shank was plooked (i.e., if it had a certain property), then it must have also had the property of being nugged.\n3. From 1 and 2, we can infer that if the shank is not plooked, then it is not necessary for it to be nugged. In other words, the absence of the property of being plooked implies the absence of the property of being nugged.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
