We know that \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled\" is true, because we are given that the flugel was not zargled.\n2. We also know that \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled\" is a logical statement, meaning that if the flugel had been blimmed, it would have been zargled.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed, because if it had been blimmed, it would have been zargled and we know that is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
