We know that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\" This means that it is possible for the fleeg to exist without being surned.\n2. We also know that \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would necessarily be surned.\n3. Now, let's assume that the fleeg is not bluttered. If the fleeg is not bluttered, then it does not follow that it must have been surned. In other words, the fact that the fleeg is not bluttered does not imply that it was surned.\n4. Therefore, based on the two premises we have, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
