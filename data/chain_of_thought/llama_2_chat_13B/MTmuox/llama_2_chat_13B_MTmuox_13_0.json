We also know that \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\" is a logical truth, meaning that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged (i.e., the two statements are logically equivalent).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged\" from the fact that \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged\". This is because if the glip was slogged, then it would be the case that the glip must have tragged, and we know that this is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
