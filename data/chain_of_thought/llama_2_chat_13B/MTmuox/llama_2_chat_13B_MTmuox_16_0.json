We know that \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\" is false, because the premise states \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\"\n2. The second premise is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\"\n3. If we assume that the sneg was crampled, then we can infer that the sneg must have sproted the frink, because of the second premise.\n4. However, we know that the sneg did not sprot the frink, because the first premise states that \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\" is false.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled, because if it were, it would have sproted the frink, but it did not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
