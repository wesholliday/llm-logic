We know that \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint\" is true, because if the wug had bimmed the zoint, then it would be the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n2. We also know that \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\" is true, because if the wug was flooped, then it must have done something to cause it to be flooped (in this case, bimming the zoint).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug was not flooped\" is true, because if the wug had been flooped, then it would be the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint, which we know is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
