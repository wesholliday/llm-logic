We know that \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\" is true, because we are given that the smonk was not plagged.\n2. We also know that \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" is a logical statement, meaning that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled\" because we know that the smonk was not plagged and the second statement says that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
