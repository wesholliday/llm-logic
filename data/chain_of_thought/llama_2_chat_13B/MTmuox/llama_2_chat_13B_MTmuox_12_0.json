We know that \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\" This means that it is possible for the smip to have not lupped the zoint, even if it was shripped.\n2. We also know that \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\" This means that if the smip was shripped, then it is certain that it lupped the zoint.\n3. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the smip was not shripped, then it did not luup the zoint. In other words, if the smip was not shripped, then it is impossible for it to have lupped the zoint.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
