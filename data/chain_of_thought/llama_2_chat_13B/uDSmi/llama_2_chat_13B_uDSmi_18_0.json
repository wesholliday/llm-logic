This means that if the notebook is not in the drawer, then it must be on the nightstand.\n\nHowever, the statement also says that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, even if it is not in the drawer.\n\nSo, if we assume that the notebook is not in the drawer, we cannot infer that it is on the nightstand. There is still a possibility that it is somewhere else or that it does not exist at all.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
