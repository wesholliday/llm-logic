The pen is in my bag: If the pen is in my bag, then it must not be on my desk (by the law of non-contradiction). Therefore, if the pen is in my bag, we can infer that it is not on my desk.\n2. The pen is on my desk: If the pen is on my desk, then it might not be in my bag (since we know it might not be on my desk). Therefore, if the pen is on my desk, we cannot infer that it is in my bag.\n\nNow, based on our analysis, can we infer that the pen is in my bag? Let me think...\n\nAnswer: no",
