This means that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nSecond, we know that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This means that there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar.\n\nNow, let me think about the possibility of the cookies being in the jar. If the cookies are in the jar, then they must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. But we already know that they might not be hidden in the pantry, so the only option left is that they are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
