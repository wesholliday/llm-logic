The keys must be either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, because they cannot be both in the drawer and dangling in the cabinet at the same time.\n2. If the keys are dangling in the cabinet, then they cannot be in the drawer.\n3. Therefore, if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, let me think about whether or not we can infer that the keys are in the drawer...\n\nHmmm... since we know that the keys cannot be both in the drawer and dangling in the cabinet, and we also know that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, then we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer!\n\nAnswer: yes",
