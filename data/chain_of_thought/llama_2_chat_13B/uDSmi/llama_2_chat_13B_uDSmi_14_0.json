The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" means that one of two things is true: either the milk is on the counter, or it is in the fridge.\n2. The phrase \"the milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge.\n3. If the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
