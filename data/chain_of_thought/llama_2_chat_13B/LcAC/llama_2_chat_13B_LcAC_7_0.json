Chris finished the race.\n\nI need to determine if we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race based on these two statements.\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement implies that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\n2. Chris finished the race. This statement tells us that Chris did complete the race.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can logically conclude based on these two statements. If we know that Chris finished the race, and we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, then we can logically conclude that...\n\nWait a minute, I have it! We can logically conclude that Alex finished the race!\n\nAnswer: yes",
