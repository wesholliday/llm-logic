We know that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n2. We are also given that \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn is definitely in the forest.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest. Since the unicorn is already known to be in the forest, it follows that the griffin must also be in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can logically draw is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
