The book is a mystery novel.\n\nCan we logically conclude that the book was written by James? Well, if both of these statements are true, then we know that the book was written by James, because the first statement says that if the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel, and the second statement says that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can logically conclude that the book was written by James.
