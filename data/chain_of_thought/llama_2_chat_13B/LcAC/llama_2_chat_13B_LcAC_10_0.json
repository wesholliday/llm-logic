We also know that \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nSo, can we logically conclude that \"The dog was inside\"?\n\nLet's analyze the information we have:\n\n* If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (premise)\n* The cat was outside (given)\n\nCan we deduce that the dog was inside? Well, if the cat was outside, it means that the dog cannot be outside too, since both animals cannot be in the same location at the same time. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the dog must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
