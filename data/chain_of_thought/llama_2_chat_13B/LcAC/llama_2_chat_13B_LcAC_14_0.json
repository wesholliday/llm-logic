We also know that \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nSo, we can start by assuming that the wolf was in the den. This means that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave, because of the first statement.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This is a fact that we know to be true.\n\n4. Based on the first statement, if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave.\n\n5. Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
