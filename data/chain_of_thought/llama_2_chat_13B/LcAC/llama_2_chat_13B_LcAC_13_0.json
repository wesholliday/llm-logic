This is because the word \"then\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise \"The truck was blue\". If the truck was blue, then it must have been true that the car was red, because if the car was not red, then the truck would not have been blue.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
