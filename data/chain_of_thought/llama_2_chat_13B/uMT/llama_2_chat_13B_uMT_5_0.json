This is given in the statement.\n\nSecond, we know that Amy did not play tennis. This is also given in the statement.\n\nSo, if we assume that Jeff played basketball, then we can infer that Amy did not play tennis. But wait, we already knew that Amy did not play tennis! So, this inference doesn't really tell us anything new.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on the information given. The fact that Amy did not play tennis does not provide any information about whether or not Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
