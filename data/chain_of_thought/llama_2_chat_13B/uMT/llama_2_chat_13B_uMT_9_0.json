This means that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we also know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that even if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nSo, can we infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt? Well, if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it must be that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
