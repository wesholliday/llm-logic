The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana would have the property of being yellow.\n2. The statement \"The banana was not yellow\" means that the banana does not have the property of being yellow.\n3. If the apple was red and the banana was not yellow, then we can infer that the apple does not have the property of being red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
