That means the cat was not inside.\n\nBut wait, we know that the cat was not outside. So, if the cat was not outside, then it must have been inside.\n\nTherefore, if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been inside too.\n\nSo, can we infer that the dog was not inside? Well, no, we cannot infer that because we know that the cat was inside, and if the dog was inside, then the cat would not have been inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
