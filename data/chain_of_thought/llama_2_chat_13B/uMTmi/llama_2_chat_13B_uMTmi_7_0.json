This is because if Alex finished the race, then Chris would have also finished the race since they are both in the same race.\n2. Chris might not have finished the race. This is because we don't know for sure whether Chris finished the race or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. This is because even if Chris did not finish the race, it does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
