This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo.\n3. Therefore, if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, we can also infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let me think about whether or not we can infer that Joe did not go to the park...\n\nHmmm... I'm not sure. Just because Lucy might not have gone to the zoo doesn't necessarily mean that Joe didn't go to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy didn't go to the zoo, such as if she was sick or if she had other plans.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, my answer is...\n\nAnswer: no.",
