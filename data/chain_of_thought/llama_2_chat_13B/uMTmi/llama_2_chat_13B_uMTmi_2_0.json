The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nBased on these statements, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest. However, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest because the statement \"the unicorn might not have been in the forest\" leaves open the possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest, but the griffin still could have been.\n\nAnswer: no",
