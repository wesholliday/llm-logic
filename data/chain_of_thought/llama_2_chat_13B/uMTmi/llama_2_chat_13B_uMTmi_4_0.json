This is based on the information that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. If the robot did visit Jupiter, then it must have been sent there by the alien, since the robot would not have gone there on its own.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot would not have been sent to Jupiter, because the alien would not have been present on Mars to send the robot to Jupiter. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, it is certain that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, the answer is...\n\nAnswer: yes",
