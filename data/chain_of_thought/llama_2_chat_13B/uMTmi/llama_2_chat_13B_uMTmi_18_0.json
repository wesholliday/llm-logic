This means that if the doll was made of plastic, the truck could not have been made of plastic too.\n\nNow, the statement also says that the truck might not have been metal. This means that even if the doll was plastic, the truck could still be made of a different material, like wood or fabric.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. If the doll was plastic, then the truck would have to be metal, and since the statement says the truck might not have been metal, it must be made of a different material. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
