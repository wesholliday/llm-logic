            "content": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt, since they are both wearing different colored shirts.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This is because there is no guarantee that Mark actually bought the blue shirt, even if Lisa did buy the red shirt. Maybe Mark decided not to buy a shirt at all, or maybe he bought a different color.\n3. Can we infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt? Based on the information given, it is not possible to infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Even if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
