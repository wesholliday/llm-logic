This is because the statement assumes that the dog and cat cannot be in the same location (i.e., both inside or both outside).\n2. The cat might not have been outside. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the cat was outside just because the dog was inside.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
