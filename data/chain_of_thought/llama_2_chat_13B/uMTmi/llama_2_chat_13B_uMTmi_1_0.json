            "content": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is because the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding\" implies that Sue was also at the wedding.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not attend the wedding, even if Mary did.\n3. Can we infer that Mary was not at the wedding? No, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the information provided. The fact that Sue might not have been at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was not there.\n\nAnswer: no",
