We know that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n2. We are also given that \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn is definitely in the forest.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin must also be in the forest, since the two statements are linked by the word \"then\".\n4. Therefore, we can deduce that \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
