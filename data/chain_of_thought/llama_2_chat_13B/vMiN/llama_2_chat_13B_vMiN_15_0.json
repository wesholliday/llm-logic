The premise of the argument is \"The shoes might not be in the closet.\" This means that it is possible that the shoes are not in the closet, but it does not necessarily mean that they are not in the closet.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\" This means that it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet.\n3. If the premise \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" is true, then the conclusion \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" logically follows. This is because if the shoes might not be in the closet, then it is not necessary for them to be there.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
