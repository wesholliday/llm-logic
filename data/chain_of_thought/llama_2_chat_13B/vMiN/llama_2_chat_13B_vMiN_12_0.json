Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe premise of the argument is \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\" This means that it is possible for the jacket to not be draped over the chair, even if it is actually the case that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be draped over the chair, even if it is actually the case that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nNow, let's think about why this argument might be logically valid. If the premise \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" is true, then it is possible for the jacket to not be draped over the chair. And if it is possible for the jacket to not be draped over the chair, then it is not necessarily true that the jacket must be draped over the chair. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, I believe that this form of argument is logically valid. Here's my answer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
