The premise of the argument is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This means that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This means that it is not certain or necessary that Mary was present at the wedding.\n3. If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it is possible that she was not there.\n4. If it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, then it is not the case that she must have been there.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" logically follows from the premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
