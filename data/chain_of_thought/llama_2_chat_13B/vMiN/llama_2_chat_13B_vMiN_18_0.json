The premise of the argument is \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\" This means that it is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not in the drawer.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\" This means that it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer.\n3. If the premise \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" is true, then the conclusion \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" logically follows. This is because if the notebook might not be in the drawer, then it is possible for it to be somewhere else or for it to be missing altogether.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
