The premise of the argument is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\" This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This means that it is not certain or necessary that Sue chose pizza.\n3. If Sue might not have chosen pizza, then it is possible that she did not choose pizza.\n4. If it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, then it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical sequence of reasoning. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
