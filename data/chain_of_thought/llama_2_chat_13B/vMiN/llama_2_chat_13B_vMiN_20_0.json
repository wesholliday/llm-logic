The premise of the argument is \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\" This means that it is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag, but we don't know for sure.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\" This means that even if the sunglasses are not in her bag, it does not necessarily follow that they must be somewhere else.\n3. To determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to ask ourselves whether it is possible for the sunglasses to be in her bag and yet not be in her bag at the same time.\n4. It is clear that this is a logical contradiction, as something cannot be both in and not in something at the same time. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
