The premise of the argument is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\" This means that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but we don't know for sure.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This means that it is not certain that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n3. If Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, then it is possible that she did not buy the red shirt.\n4. If it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not certain that she did buy the red shirt.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" logically follows from the premise \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
