The premise of the argument is \"The pen might not be in my bag.\" This means that it is possible that the pen is not in my bag, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not in my bag.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\" This means that it is not necessary for the pen to be in my bag.\n3. If the premise \"The pen might not be in my bag\" is true, then the conclusion \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" logically follows. This is because if the pen might not be in my bag, then it is possible for the pen to not be in my bag, and therefore it is not necessary for the pen to be in my bag.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
