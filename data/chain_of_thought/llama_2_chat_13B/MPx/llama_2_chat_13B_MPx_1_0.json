We know that \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if one part of the sentence is true, then the other part must also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"The flugel was blimmed.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is true - the flugel was blimmed.\n3. Therefore, based on the conditional statement, we can infer that the second part of the statement must also be true. In other words, if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
