The premise is given as \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This means that if the sprocket was in a certain state (cranked), then it must be in another state (dagged).\n2. We are also given that \"The sprocket was cranked.\" This means that the sprocket is in the state of being cranked.\n3. Based on the premise, we can infer that the sprocket is also in the state of being dagged, because if it was cranked, then it must be dagged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
