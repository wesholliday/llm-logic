Here we go!\n\nSo, the first sentence is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This sentence is saying that if the fribble was snurgled (whatever that means), then it must have crinked.\n\nThe second sentence is \"The fribble was snurgled.\" This sentence is telling us that the fribble was indeed snurgled.\n\nNow, let's think about what we know so far. We know that the fribble was snurgled, and we know that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. Can we infer that the fribble crinked?\n\nHmmm...let me think about this for a moment. Yes, I believe we can infer that the fribble crinked! If the fribble was snurgled and the sentence says that if it was snurgled, then it must have crinked, then logically speaking, the fribble must have crinked.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
