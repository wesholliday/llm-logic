We know that \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part of the sentence (i.e., \"the clug was fleeked\") is true, then the second part of the sentence (i.e., \"the clug snugged\") must also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"The clug was fleeked.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is true, so we can infer that the second part of the statement is also true.\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The clug snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
