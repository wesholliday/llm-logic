We know that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if one part of the sentence is true (i.e., \"the twonk was plinked\"), then the other part of the sentence must also be true (i.e., \"it was varnished\").\n2. We are also given that \"The twonk was plinked.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is true, so we can infer that the second part of the statement is also true.\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"It was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
