The sentence \"The smonk was vreebled\" is a premise that we are given.\n3. To infer \"The smonk plagged\", we need to assume that the condition in the conditional statement (i.e., \"the smonk was vreebled\") is true.\n4. Since we have already established that the smonk was vreebled, it follows that the condition in the conditional statement is true.\n5. Therefore, based on the premise and the conditional statement, we can infer that the smonk plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
