The antecedent of the conditional statement is \"the smip was shripped\".\n3. The consequent of the conditional statement is \"the smip lupped the zoint\".\n4. We are given that \"the smip was shripped\".\n5. Therefore, by the principle of modus ponens, we can infer that the consequent of the conditional statement, \"the smip lupped the zoint\", is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
