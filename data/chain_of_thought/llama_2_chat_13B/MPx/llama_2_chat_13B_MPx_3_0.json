We know that \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if one part of the sentence (in this case, \"the splat was morphed\") is true, then the other part of the sentence (in this case, \"the splat quanked\") must also be true.\n2. We are also given that \"The splat was morphed.\" This means that we have established that one part of the conditional statement is true.\n3. Therefore, based on the conditional statement, we can infer that the other part of the statement (i.e., \"the splat quanked\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
