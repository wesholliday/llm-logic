To do this, we need to reverse the statement. So, if the truck was metal, then the doll would be...?\n\nWait a minute, I think I see something here. If the truck was metal, then it's not possible for the doll to be plastic because the statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal. So, if the truck is metal, then the doll must be...?\n\nAh ha! I've got it! If the truck was metal, then the doll must be made of something else, like wood or cloth. But we know that the doll wasn't made of wood or cloth because the statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal.\n\nSo, if the truck was metal, then the doll couldn't have been plastic. Therefore, we can infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
