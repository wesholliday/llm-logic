The statement says \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n2. The statement does not say anything about the color of the banana affecting the color of the apple. It only states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple must also be red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
