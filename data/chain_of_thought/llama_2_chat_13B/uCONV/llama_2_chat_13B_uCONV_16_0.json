            "content": "Okay! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The question states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that there is a direct relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants.\n2. If the shirt was cotton, then it is certain that the pants were denim. This is because the statement \"if the shirt was cotton\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship, where the material of the shirt directly affects the material of the pants.\n3. Therefore, if we know that the pants were denim, we can infer that the shirt was cotton. This is because the statement \"if the pants were denim\" implies a logical consequence of the previous statement \"if the shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
