This means that all books written by James are mystery novels.\n2. The question asks if we can infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. In other words, can we assume that all mystery novels were written by James?\n3. If we assume that all mystery novels were written by James, then we are making an assumption about the authorship of all mystery novels, not just the one we are considering.\n4. However, the statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. It does not tell us that all mystery novels were written by James.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
