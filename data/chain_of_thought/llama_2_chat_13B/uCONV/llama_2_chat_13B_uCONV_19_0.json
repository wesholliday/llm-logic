This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n3. However, we are asked to infer whether if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n4. To do this, we need to consider the possibility that Tom might not have watched football.\n5. If Tom didn't watch football, then it is possible that Jen watched basketball without Tom watching football.\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
