It simply means that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nFor example, if we know that Jeff was in college and played on the basketball team, then it would be reasonable to infer that he must have played basketball. However, if we only know that Jeff might not have played basketball, then it does not necessarily follow that he must not have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" from \"Jeff might not have played basketball.\"",
