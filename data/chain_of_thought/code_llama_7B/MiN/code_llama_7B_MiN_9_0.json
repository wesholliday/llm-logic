The word \"might\" in this sentence means that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that she definitely did not buy it.\n\nFor example, if we know that Lisa has a limited budget and cannot afford to buy the red shirt, then we can infer that \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\" However, this does not entail that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. In fact, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because she could not afford it, even though she had the opportunity to do so.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.",
