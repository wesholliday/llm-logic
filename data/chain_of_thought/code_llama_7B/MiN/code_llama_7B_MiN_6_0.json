It simply means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFor example, if we know that Sue has a strong dislike for pizza, then it would be reasonable to infer that she might not have chosen pizza even if it was offered to her. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza. It could simply mean that she had other options or preferences that led her to choose something else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"",
