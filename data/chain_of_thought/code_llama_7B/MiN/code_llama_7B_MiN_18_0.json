The word \"might\" implies possibility or uncertainty, but it does not necessarily imply negation.\n\nFor example, if we know that the notebook might not be in the drawer, this does not mean that it is not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer. It simply means that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" that it is not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.",
