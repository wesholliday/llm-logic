            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from \"Sue was at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as a conditional proof. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not logically follow from \"Sue was at the wedding,\" and therefore we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The premise \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a factual statement, and it is independent of the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a hypothetical statement that assumes the truth of the premise \"Mary was at the wedding.\" However, we do not know whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n3. Therefore, even if we assume that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot logically infer that she was at the wedding based on the fact that Sue was there. The conditional statement is a logical consequence of the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding,\" but it does not follow from the factual statement \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n### Answer: No",
