    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

While it is true that the Warriors have lower odds to win than the Lakers and Celtics, it is also possible for other teams to upset their favorites and win the championship. Additionally, there are many factors that can influence the outcome of a basketball game, such as injuries, coaching decisions, and player performance, which could impact the likelihood of one team winning over another.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to make a statement about the likelihood of the Celtics winning based solely on the odds of the other teams. It is important to consider all available information and factors before making any predictions or conclusions.",
