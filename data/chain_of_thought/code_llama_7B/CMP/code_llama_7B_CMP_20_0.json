    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

The statement \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\" is a conditional statement that implies a specific scenario. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the likelihood of coffee losing its status as the most popular morning beverage.\n\nIn fact, it is possible that tea could gain popularity as a morning drink, especially if marketing campaigns targeting younger consumers are successful. Additionally, there may be other factors at play that could influence the popularity of different morning beverages, such as changes in consumer preferences or the introduction of new products.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to make a definitive statement about whether soda will retain the most morning drinkers if coffee doesn't retain its status.",
