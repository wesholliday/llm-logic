    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

This is because there are other factors at play here, such as the severity of the illnesses and the population's overall health. Even if flu is less prevalent than expected, it could still cause a significant number of cases, especially in certain populations or areas. Additionally, strep infections can be more severe than colds, which could lead to a higher number of hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nTherefore, while it is possible that strep infections may not be as prevalent as expected if flu is less prevalent, it is not necessarily the case that if flu does not infect the most, strep will.",
