The conclusion logically follows from the premise, as the flob's movement is a necessary condition for its skizzling. Therefore, we can infer that if the flob did not move, then it was not skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is true or false based on the information provided.\nThe argument is true because the information provided supports the conclusion. If the flob did not move, then it was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
