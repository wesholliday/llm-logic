The premise \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is a necessary condition for the conclusion \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" This means that if the whiffle was shanked and did not tink, it must have been not shanked.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound or unsound.\nThe argument is sound because it uses a valid logical consequence to draw an inference. However, it is important to note that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises in all possible worlds. For example, if the whiffle was shanked but did not tink, then it would not be necessary for the whiffle to have been not shanked. Therefore, the argument is not necessarily true in all possible worlds.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
