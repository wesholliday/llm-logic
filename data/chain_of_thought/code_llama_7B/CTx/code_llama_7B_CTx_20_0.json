The given statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not logically imply the opposite of the condition.\n\nFor example, if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it did surn. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered. There could be other reasons why the fleeg did not surn, even if it was bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the opposite of the condition from the given statement.",
