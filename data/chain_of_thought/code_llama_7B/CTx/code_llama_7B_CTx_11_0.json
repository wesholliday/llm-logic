The two statements are related but not logically equivalent.\n\nThe first statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" implies that if the flight was delayed, it was also canceled. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the flight was not canceled, it was not delayed.\n\nFor example, let's say a flight is delayed by 2 hours but it is not canceled. This would satisfy the first statement but not the second one.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" from \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\".",
