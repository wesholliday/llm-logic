The two statements are related but not logically equivalent.\n\nThe first statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" implies that if the shank was looked at, it was also nudged. This is a causal relationship between the two events.\n\nThe second statement \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" does not necessarily imply this causal relationship. It simply states that if the shank was not nudged, it was not looked at. This is a different conclusion than the first statement, and it does not logically follow from it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.",
