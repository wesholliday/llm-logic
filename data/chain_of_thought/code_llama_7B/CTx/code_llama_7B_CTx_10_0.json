The given statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not necessarily imply that the negation of the antecedent implies the negation of the consequent. In other words, just because the wug was sproonged if it was garpled, it does not mean that the wug was not garpled if it was not sproonged.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where a person is given a choice between two options: either they can eat a healthy meal or they can watch TV. If the person chooses to eat a healthy meal, then it means that they are taking care of their health. However, just because the person chose to eat a healthy meal does not mean that they did not choose to watch TV if they were not going to eat a healthy meal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that the wug was not garpled if it was not sproonged.",
