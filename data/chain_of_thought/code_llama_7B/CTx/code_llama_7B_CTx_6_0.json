However, the conclusion may not follow from the premise if the grommet did not plop the frink for some other reason than being sploffed.\n\nStep 3: Consider whether the argument is deductively valid or inductively valid.\nThe argument is deductively valid because it uses a logical consequence rule (i.e., modus ponens) to derive the conclusion from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid. However, it is important to note that the conclusion may not be true in all possible worlds, and the argument's validity does not guarantee its truth.",
