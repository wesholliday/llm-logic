The sentence \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" does not logically imply that the wug did not bim the zoint. It only implies that if the wug was flooped, it also bimmed the zoint.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where a wug is flooped and then it bims the zoint. This would satisfy the first sentence, but it does not necessarily mean that the wug did not bim the zoint before it was flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given sentence that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.",
