The given statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not necessarily imply that the opposite of the condition is true. For example, if the statement is \"If it rains, then the grass will be wet,\" it does not mean that if it doesn't rain, the grass won't be wet.\n\nIn this case, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended, but we cannot infer that if the dreb was not spended, then the dreb was not vroombed. This is because the given statement does not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\n### Answer: No",
