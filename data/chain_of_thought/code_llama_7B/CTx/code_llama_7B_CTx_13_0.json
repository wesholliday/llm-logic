The given statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not necessarily imply that the opposite of the condition is true. For example, if the glip was slogged, it could have been tragged or not tragged, but we don't know which one without further information.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\nIf I am a doctor and my patient has a fever, then they are sick. This statement does not imply that the patient is healthy if they do not have a fever. It only implies that if the patient has a fever, then they are sick.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged. We need more information to make such an inference.",
