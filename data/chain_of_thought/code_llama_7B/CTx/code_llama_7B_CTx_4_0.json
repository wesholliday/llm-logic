In this case, the premise is \"If the fribble was snurgled,\" and the conclusion is \"If the fribble did not crink.\" If the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked, since the statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is true. Therefore, if the fribble did not crink, then it must not have been snurgled, which means that the conclusion is valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the premise \"If the fribble was snurgled\" implies that the fribble crinked, and the conclusion \"If the fribble did not crink\" is a logical consequence of this fact. Therefore, the conclusion can be inferred from the premises using logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
