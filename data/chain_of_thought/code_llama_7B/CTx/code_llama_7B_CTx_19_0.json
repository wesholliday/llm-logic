This implies a causal relationship between being vreebled and plagging. However, the second sentence does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between not plagging and not being vreebled.\n\nFor example, we could have a situation where the smonk was vreebled but did not plagge due to some other factor. In this case, the first sentence would still be true, but the second sentence would not be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the smonk did not plagge, then it was not vreebled based on these two sentences alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
