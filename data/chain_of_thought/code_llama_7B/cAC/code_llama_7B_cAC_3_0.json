The first statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies if the condition stated in the antecedent (if clause) is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the book was written by James.\"\n2. The second statement simply states that the book is a mystery novel, without any connection to who wrote it.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James based on these two statements alone. We need additional information or evidence to make this conclusion.",
