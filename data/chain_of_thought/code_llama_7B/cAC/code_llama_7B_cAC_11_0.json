In this case, we do not have enough information to determine whether the cake was chocolate or not, so we cannot say for sure whether Premise 1 is valid or not.\nPremise 2 is a simple statement that is always true if the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, it is valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion that can be drawn from the given premises.\nSince Premise 1 is not valid, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the information provided in Premise 2 alone. However, if we had additional information that would make Premise 1 valid, then we could conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\n### Answer: No",
