The premises do not necessarily imply that Tom watched football. For example, Tom could have watched football and then gone to watch basketball with Jen. In this scenario, both premises would be true, but the conclusion would not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Tom watched football based on the given information. The argument is incomplete and does not provide enough evidence to support the conclusion.",
