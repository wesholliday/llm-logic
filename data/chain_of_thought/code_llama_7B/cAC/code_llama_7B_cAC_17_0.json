This statement is independent of the first one and does not affect our ability to conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the two statements provided. The fact that Kate ate salad does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta, as there may be other possible explanations for her eating salad.\n\n### Answer: No",
