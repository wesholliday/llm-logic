This is because there are many possible scenarios where the missing puzzle piece could be located, and the fact that it might not be blending in with the other pieces on the floor does not necessarily mean that it is in the box.\n\nHowever, if we have additional information that suggests the missing puzzle piece is likely to be in the box, such as the fact that the box is closed or locked, then we could infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.",
