The first premise states that the flugel might not be zargled, which means it could be either blimmed or unzargled.\n2. The second premise states that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This implies that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel is blimmed based on these two premises alone. It's possible that the flugel is unzargled and not blimmed.\n\n### Answer: No",
