The first premise states that the zinger might not be smoogled, which means it could be either smoogled or not smoogled.\n2. The second premise states that either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled. This implies that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n3. However, the first premise states that the zinger might not be smoogled, which means it could still be not smoogled even if it must be fraggled according to the second premise.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger is fraggled\" from these two premises.",
