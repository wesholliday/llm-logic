The first premise states that the smip might not be lupped, which means it could be either lupped or not lupped.\n2. The second premise states that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. This means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n3. However, we are given no information about whether the smip is actually lupped or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smip is shripped based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The smip is shripped\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.",
