The first premise states that the sprocket might not be daggled, and the second premise states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nFor example, suppose the sprocket is not cranked but is instead stuck in a particular position due to some other factor. In this case, the sprocket might not be daggled, and yet it is not cranked either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket is cranked from these premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
