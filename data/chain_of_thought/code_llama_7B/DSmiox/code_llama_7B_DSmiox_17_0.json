The first premise states that the flob might not be movated, which means it could be in a state of rest or motion.\n2. The second premise states that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. This implies that the flob is either skizzled or it must be movated, but it does not necessarily mean that the flob is skizzled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given information.",
