The first premise states that the splat might not be quanked, which means it could be either quanked or not quanked.\n2. The second premise states that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This implies that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n3. However, we are given no information about whether the splat is actually quanked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The splat is morphed\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.",
