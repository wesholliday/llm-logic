The first premise states that the fleeg might not be surned, which means it could be either bluttered or unsurned.\n2. The second premise states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. This implies that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n3. However, the first premise does not necessarily imply that the fleeg is bluttered. It could also be unsurned.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from these two premises.",
