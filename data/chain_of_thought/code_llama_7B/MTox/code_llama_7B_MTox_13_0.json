The first premise states that the glip was not tragged, and the second premise states that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the glip was not slogged.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the glip was not tragged but was still slogged. In this case, the first premise would be true (the glip was not tragged), but the second premise would also be true (if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged). Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip was not slogged from these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is no.",
