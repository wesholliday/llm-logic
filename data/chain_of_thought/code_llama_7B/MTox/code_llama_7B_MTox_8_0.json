The first premise states that the sprocket was not daggled, and the second premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nFor example, suppose the sprocket was cranked but not daggled. In this case, the first premise would still be true (the sprocket was not daggled), but the second premise would not be true (the sprocket was cranked but not daggled). Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked from these two premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
