The first premise states that the flight was not zoomed, and the second premise states that if the flight was blurred, then it was zoomed. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the flight was not blurred.\n\nFor example, imagine a situation where the flight was not blurred but was instead zoomed in on a specific area of interest. In this case, the first premise would still be true (the flight was not zoomed), but the second premise would not be true (the flight was not blurred).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flight was not blurred from these two premises alone.",
