The first premise states that the dreb was not spent, and the second premise states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spent. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nFor example, suppose the dreb was vroombed but not spent. Then, according to the first premise, the dreb was not spent, and according to the second premise, if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spent. However, this does not necessarily mean that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the dreb was not vroombed from the given premises.",
