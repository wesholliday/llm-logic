The first sentence states that the grommet did not plop the frink, while the second sentence states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. These two sentences do not necessarily imply that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the grommet was sploffed but did not plop the frink. In this case, the first sentence would still be true (the grommet did not plop the frink), while the second sentence would also be true (if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed based on these two sentences.",
