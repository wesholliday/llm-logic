The first statement says that the smip did not lup the zoint, and the second statement says that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the smip was not shripped.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the smip was shripped but did not lup the zoint. In this case, the first statement would still be true (the smip did not lup the zoint), and the second statement would also be true (if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the smip was not shripped based on these two statements alone. We need additional information or context to make this inference.",
