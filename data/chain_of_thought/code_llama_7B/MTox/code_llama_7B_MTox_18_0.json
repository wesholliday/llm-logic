The first premise states that the shank was not nugged, and the second premise states that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the shank was not plooked.\n\nFor example, suppose the shank was plooked but not nugged. In this case, the first premise would still be true (the shank was not nugged), but the second premise would not be true (if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged). Therefore, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked based on these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
