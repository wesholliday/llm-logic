The first statement, \"The splat did not quank,\" is a factual statement that does not imply anything about the splat's morph status. It simply states that the splat did not quank.\n2. The second statement, \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat was not morphed. It could have been morphed and still not quanked.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat was not morphed from these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the splat's morph status.",
