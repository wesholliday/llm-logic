The first statement implies that the flob did not move, which means it cannot have been skizzled.\n2. The second statement states that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have moved. However, we already know from the first statement that the flob did not move, so this statement is irrelevant to our inference.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled based on these two statements alone.",
