The first premise states that the flugel was not zargled, and the second premise states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the flugel is not zargled but it is also not blimmed. In this case, the first premise would still be true (the flugel was not zargled), but the second premise would not be true (the flugel was not blimmed). Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was not blimmed from these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
