To do this, we need to use logical reasoning and draw conclusions based on the given information.\n\nStep 3: Let's start by considering the first premise. If the whiffle did not tink, then it means that the whiffle was not shanked. This is because if the whiffle was shanked, then it would have tinked, but since it didn't tink, we can conclude that it wasn't shanked.\n\nStep 4: Now let's consider the second premise. If the whiffle was shanked, then it means that the whiffle tinked. This is because if the whiffle was not shanked, then it would not have tinked, but since it did tink, we can conclude that it was shanked.\n\nStep 5: Based on these two premises, we can draw a conclusion about whether or not the whiffle was shanked. If the whiffle was not shanked, then it would not have tinked, but since it did tink, we can conclude that it was shanked. Therefore, we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\n### Answer: Yes",
