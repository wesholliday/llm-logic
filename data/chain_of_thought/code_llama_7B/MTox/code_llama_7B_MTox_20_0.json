It simply means that the fleeg did not surf, which could be due to various reasons such as bad weather, lack of waves, or other factors.\n\nTherefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the fleeg's bluttering status based on these two statements alone. We would need additional information or context to make a more informed judgment.",
