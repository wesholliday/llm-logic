The first statement states that the twonk was not varnished, while the second statement states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nFor example, imagine that the twonk was not varnished because it had never been plinked before. In this case, the first statement would be true, but the second statement would not be true, as the twonk had not been plinked yet. Therefore, we cannot infer that the twonk was not plinked based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
