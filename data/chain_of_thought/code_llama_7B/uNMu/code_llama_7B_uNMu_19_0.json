The fact that the watch was not charging and the person was unable to find a charger suggests that the watch may not have been properly charged or that there may be an issue with the charging mechanism. Additionally, the person's statement that they had tried charging the watch multiple times before giving up suggests that they may have tried charging it on other surfaces as well.",
