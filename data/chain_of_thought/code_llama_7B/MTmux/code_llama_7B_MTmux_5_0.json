A truth table is a table that displays the possible combinations of values for the variables in an argument and indicates whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nStep 5: Using a truth table, we can see that if P1 is true and P2 is false, then C1 is true. This means that if the zinger was fraggled and it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled, then it's possible that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we can infer that C1 is true.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
