The first premise states that if the sneg was cramped, then the sneg must have sprouted the frink. This means that if the sneg is cramped, it will necessarily sprout the frink.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the sneg must have sprouted the frink. This means that there are cases where the sneg is cramped and yet does not sprout the frink.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg was not cramped\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that it's possible for the sneg to be cramped and yet not sprout the frink.\n\n### Answer: No",
