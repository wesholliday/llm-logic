The first premise states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that if the grommet was sploffed, it is necessary that the grommet plopped the frink.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that it is possible for the grommet to have not plopped the frink even if it was sploffed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that it is possible for the grommet to have been sploffed and yet not have plopped the frink.",
