The first premise states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This means that if the clug was fleeked, it is necessary that the clug was also snugged.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This means that it is possible for the clug to have been fleeked without being snugged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the clug was fleeked at all!\n\n### Answer: No",
