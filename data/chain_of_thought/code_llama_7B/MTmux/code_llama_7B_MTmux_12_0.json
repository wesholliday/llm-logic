The first premise states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip was shripped, it is necessarily true that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that it is possible for the smip to be shripped without the smip having lupped the zoint.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the smip may have been shripped and not have lupped the zoint.\n\n### Answer: No",
