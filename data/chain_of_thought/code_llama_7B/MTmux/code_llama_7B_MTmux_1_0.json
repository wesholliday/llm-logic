The first premise states that if the flugel is blimmed, then it must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel is blimmed, we can infer that it was also zargled.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This means that there are cases where the flugel is blimmed but not zargled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the flugel was blimmed in the first place!\n\n### Answer: No",
