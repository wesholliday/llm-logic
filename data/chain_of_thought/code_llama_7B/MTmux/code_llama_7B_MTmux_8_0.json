The first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it is necessarily true that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that it is possible for the sprocket to be cranked without being daggled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even conclude that the sprocket was cranked, because the second premise allows for the possibility that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\n### Answer: No",
