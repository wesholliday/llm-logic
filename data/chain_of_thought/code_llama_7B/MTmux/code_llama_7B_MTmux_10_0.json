The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the wug was sproonged,\" and the consequent is \"it must have been garpled.\"\n2. The second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is not the case that the wug must have been garpled. This does not necessarily mean that the wug was not sproonged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug was not sproonged\" from these two premises alone. We need more information or evidence to make this conclusion.",
