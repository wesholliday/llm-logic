This means that if the wug was flooped, it is necessary that the wug also bimmed the zoint.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that it is not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This means that it is possible for the wug to be flooped without bimming the zoint.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the wug was not flooped because if the wug was flooped, then it would be necessary for the wug to bimmed the zoint (as stated in the first premise). However, we know that it is possible for the wug to be flooped without bimming the zoint (as stated in the second premise). Therefore, we can conclude that the wug was not flooped.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
