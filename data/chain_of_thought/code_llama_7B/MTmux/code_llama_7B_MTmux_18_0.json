The first premise states that if the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged. This means that if the shank was plooked, it is necessarily true that the shank was also nugged.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged. This means that it is possible for the shank to have been plooked without being nugged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that it's possible for the shank to have been both plooked and not nugged.\n\n### Answer: No",
