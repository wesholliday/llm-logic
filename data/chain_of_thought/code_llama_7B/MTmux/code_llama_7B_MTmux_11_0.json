The first premise states that if the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed. This means that if the flug was blummed, it is necessarily true that the flug was also zimmed.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that it is possible for the flug to have been blummed without being zimmed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that it's possible for the flug to have been blummed without being zimmed.\n\n### Answer: No",
