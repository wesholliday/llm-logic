The first premise states that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved. This means that if the flob was skizzled, it is necessary for the flob to have moved.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the flob must have moved. This means that it is possible for the flob to have remained stationary even if it was skizzled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that it is possible for the flob to have been skizzled and yet remain stationary.\n\n### Answer: No",
