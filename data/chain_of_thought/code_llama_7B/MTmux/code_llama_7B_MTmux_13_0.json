The first premise states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. This means that if the glip was slogged, it is necessarily true that the glip must have tragged.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged. This means that it is possible for the glip to be slogged without it being necessary or sufficient for the glip to have tragged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the glip may have been slogged even if it did not have to tragged.\n\n### Answer: No",
