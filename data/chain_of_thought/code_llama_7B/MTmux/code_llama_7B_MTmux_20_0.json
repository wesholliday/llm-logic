The first premise states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it must have been surned, regardless of whether or not it actually was bluttered.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. This means that there may be cases where the fleeg was not bluttered and yet it still must have been surned.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these two premises. The first premise only establishes a necessary condition for the fleeg to have been surned, while the second premise only rules out a specific case where the fleeg was not bluttered and yet it still must have been surned.\n\n### Answer: No",
