This means that if the splat was morphed, it is necessarily true that the splat must have quanked. However, the second premise states that it is not the case that the splat must have quanked. This does not necessarily mean that the splat was not morphed. It could be that the splat was morphed but did not quank.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from these two premises that the splat was not morphed.",
