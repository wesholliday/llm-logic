This means that if the fribble is snurgled, it will necessarily have crinked.\n\nStep 5: The second premise states that it is not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that it is possible for the fribble to be snurgled without it having crinked.\n\nStep 6: Based on the above analysis, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from the given premises. This is because if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked according to the first premise, but since the second premise states that it is not the case that the fribble must have crinked, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
