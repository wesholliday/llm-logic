The first premise states that if the smonk is vreebled, then it must have plagged. This means that if the smonk is vreebled, there is a possibility that it did plag.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that even if the smonk is vreebled, it does not necessarily mean that it must have plagged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from these two premises. The first premise only establishes a possibility of plagging, while the second premise negates this possibility.\n\n### Answer: No",
