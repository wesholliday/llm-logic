The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement that implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob also chose pasta. However, it does not necessarily mean that Bob chose pasta without any conditions.\n\nFor example, suppose that Sue and Bob are both vegetarians and they both choose pizza as their meal option. In this case, the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" would still be true, but it does not necessarily mean that Bob chose pasta without any conditions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta based on the premises given.",
