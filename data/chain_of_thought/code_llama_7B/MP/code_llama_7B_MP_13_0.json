In this case, the condition is that the car was red.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true regardless of any conditions.\n\nStep 4: We can infer \"The truck was blue\" from the first statement only if the condition in the first statement (i.e., the car being red) is met.\n\nStep 5: Since we are given that the car was red, it follows that the condition in the first statement is met, and therefore we can infer \"The truck was blue\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
