In this case, the condition is that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true regardless of any conditions. In this case, the statement is \"Mary was at the wedding\".\n\nStep 4: We can infer that Sue was at the wedding because the first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since we know that Mary was at the wedding (from the second statement), we can conclude that Sue must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
