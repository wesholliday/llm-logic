In this case, the condition is that the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the truck was metal because the first statement implies that the truck was metal only if the doll was plastic. Since we know that the doll was plastic, and the first statement implies that the truck was metal, then it must be the case that the truck was metal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
