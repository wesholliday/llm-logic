The premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, it does not provide any information about who actually went to the park or the zoo. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lucy went to the zoo based on this premise alone.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the strength of the argument.\nThe argument is weak because it lacks sufficient evidence to support the conclusion. The premise provides no information about who actually went to the park or the zoo, and therefore cannot be used to logically infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n### Answer: No",
