In this case, the condition is that the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true regardless of any conditions. In this case, the statement is \"The bear was in the cave\".\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the wolf was in the den because the first statement implies that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Since the bear was in the cave (as stated in the second statement), we can conclude that the wolf must have been in the den as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
