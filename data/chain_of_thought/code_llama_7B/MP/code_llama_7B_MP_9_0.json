The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies if the condition stated in the antecedent (If Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. In this case, the antecedent is not necessarily true, as we do not know whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the first statement alone. We would need additional information to determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.",
