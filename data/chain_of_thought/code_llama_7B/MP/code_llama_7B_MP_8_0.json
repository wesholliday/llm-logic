The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Premise 1)\n2. The vampire was awake. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake. (Conclusion)\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. If the vampire was awake, it does not necessarily mean that the mummy was also awake. The mummy could have been asleep or even dead.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The mummy was awake\" from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The vampire was awake.\"",
