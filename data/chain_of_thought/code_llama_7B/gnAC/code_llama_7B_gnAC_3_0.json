The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. However, this does not mean that the book was written by James necessarily.\n\nFor example, imagine that there are two books, one written by James and one not written by James. If both books happen to be mystery novels, then the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" would still hold true for both books, even though only one of them was actually written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true based solely on the fact that \"The book is a mystery novel\" and \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" are both true. We need additional information or evidence to determine whether the book was actually written by James or not.",
