(True)\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nConclusion: The doll was plastic.\n\nReasoning: If the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true, and the premise \"The truck was metal\" is also true, then it logically follows that the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" must be true as well. This is because if the first premise implies that the truck was metal, and the second premise states that the truck was indeed metal, then it must be the case that the doll was plastic, since the first premise implies that the doll was plastic given that the truck was metal.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
