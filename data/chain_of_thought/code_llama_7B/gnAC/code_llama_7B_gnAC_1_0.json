(conclusion)\n\nReasoning:\n\nBased on premises 1 and 2, we can conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. It is possible that Sue was at the wedding but Mary was not. Therefore, the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
