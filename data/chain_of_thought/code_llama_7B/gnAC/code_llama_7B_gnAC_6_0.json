The statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' implies a causal relationship between the two choices, but it does not guarantee that Sue actually made those choices. It is possible that Sue chose something else instead of pizza, and Bob chose pasta as a result of some other reason.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (given premise)\n2. Bob chose pasta (given premise)\n3. Therefore, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (modus ponens)\n4. However, it is not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza (contradiction)\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises.",
