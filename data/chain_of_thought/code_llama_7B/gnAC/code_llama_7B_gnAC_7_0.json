The statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' implies a causal relationship between Alex and Chris finishing the race, but it does not guarantee that Alex actually finished the race.\n\nFor example, let's say that Alex and Chris are both running in a race, and they are both in the same position at the finish line. Even though Chris crossed the finish line first, it is possible that Alex did not cross the finish line at all, but still finished the race. In this case, 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' would be true, but 'Alex finished the race' would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'Alex finished the race' is true based solely on the fact that 'Chris finished the race' is true and 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true.",
