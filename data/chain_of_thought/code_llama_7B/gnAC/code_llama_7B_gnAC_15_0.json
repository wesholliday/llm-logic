(conclusion)\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin also took a train. This means that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin must have taken a train as well. However, the second premise states that Erin took a train, which contradicts the assumption that Sam took a plane. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that Sam took a plane.\n\n### Answer: No",
