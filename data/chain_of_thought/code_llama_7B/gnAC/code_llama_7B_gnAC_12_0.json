The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies a causal relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, but it does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park in order to make Lucy go to the zoo.\n\nFor example, suppose that Lucy went to the zoo on her own, without Joe's involvement. In this case, \"Lucy went to the zoo\" would be true, but \"Joe went to the park\" would not be true. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Joe went to the park\" is true based solely on the information that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo\" are both true.\n\n### Answer: No",
