The first option is that the milk is chilling in the fridge, which means it is not yet ready to drink. In this case, the second statement \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\" would be true, as the milk is not actually chilling in the fridge.\n\nOn the other hand, if the milk is on the counter, then it is not chilling in the fridge, and the second statement would also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter based on these two statements.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
