If the umbrella is tucked away in the closet, it means that it is not currently in use or available for use. On the other hand, if the umbrella is in the car, it means that it is currently being used or is available for use.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car because the statement \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" implies that the umbrella is currently being used or is available for use. Therefore, it is more likely that the umbrella is in the car than that it is tucked away in the closet.",
