This means that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that the shoes aren't lined up by the door. This contradicts the first premise, as it implies that the shoes are not in the closet either.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
