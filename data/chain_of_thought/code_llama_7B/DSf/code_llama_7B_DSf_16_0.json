This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the pen isn't on my desk. This contradicts with the first statement, as we have just established that if the pen isn't on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag based on the given statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
