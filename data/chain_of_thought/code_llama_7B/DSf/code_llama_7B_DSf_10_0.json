This can be written as \"If the missing sock is not under the bed, then it is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement, \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\".\n\nStep 4: Based on the third statement, we can conclude that the missing sock is not under the bed. This means that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
