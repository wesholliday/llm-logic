This means that if the sunglasses are perched on her head, then they cannot be in her bag.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\nStep 4: Based on the first and third statements, we can infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
