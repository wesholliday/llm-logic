This means that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This contradicts with the first statement, as we have just established that if the jacket isn't hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
