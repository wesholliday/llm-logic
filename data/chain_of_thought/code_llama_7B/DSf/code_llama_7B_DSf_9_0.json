The first statement, \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box,\" implies that there are two possible scenarios for the missing puzzle piece's location: either it is on the floor and blends in with the surrounding objects, or it is inside the box.\n2. The second statement, \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor,\" contradicts the first statement by indicating that the missing puzzle piece is not located on the floor.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box, as the only other option (i.e., being on the floor) has been ruled out by the second statement.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
