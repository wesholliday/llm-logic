This means that if the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen. This contradicts with the first statement, as we have just established that if the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
