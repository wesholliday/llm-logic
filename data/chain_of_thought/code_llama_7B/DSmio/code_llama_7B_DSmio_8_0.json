The first statement suggests that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, while the second statement implies that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This creates a possibility that the remote control could be hidden under the couch, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
