The first statement suggests that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, while the second statement states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. This creates a possibility that the milk could be in another location, such as in the refrigerator, even if it is not chilling. Therefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
