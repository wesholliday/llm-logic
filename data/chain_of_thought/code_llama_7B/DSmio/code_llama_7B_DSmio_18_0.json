The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that it is possible for the notebook to be in a different location, such as in a drawer or on a shelf. Additionally, the statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there are only two possibilities: either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on these statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
