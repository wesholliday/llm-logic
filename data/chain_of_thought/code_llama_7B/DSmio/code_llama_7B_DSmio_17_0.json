The first statement suggests that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, while the second statement states that either the scarf is stuffed in your backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. This creates a possibility that the scarf could be draped on the coat rack, which would contradict the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
