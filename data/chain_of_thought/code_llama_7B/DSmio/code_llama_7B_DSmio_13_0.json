The first statement suggests that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, while the second statement states that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf. This creates a possibility that the toy could be somewhere else entirely, such as on a table or in another room. Therefore, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box based solely on these two statements.\n\n### Answer: No",
