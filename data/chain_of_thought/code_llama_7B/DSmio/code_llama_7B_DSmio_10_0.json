The first statement suggests that the missing sock might not be under the bed, while the second statement states that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. This creates a possibility that the missing sock could be in neither location, which would make the second statement false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
