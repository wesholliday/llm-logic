This means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk. This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second statements, we can infer that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag. Therefore, \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
