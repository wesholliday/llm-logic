This means that it is possible for the sunglasses to be in her bag, as she may have taken them out of her pocket and put them in her bag.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This means that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can infer that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag. This implies that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
