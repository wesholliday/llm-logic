The first statement suggests that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, while the second statement implies that either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This creates a possibility that the cat is actually playing in the bedroom, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
