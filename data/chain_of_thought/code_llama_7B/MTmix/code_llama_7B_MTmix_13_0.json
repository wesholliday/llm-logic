This means that if the glip was slogged, it is necessarily true that the glip tragged.\n\nThe second premise states that the glip might not have tragged. This does not contradict the first premise, as it only provides a possibility that the glip did not tragged. It does not rule out the possibility that the glip was slogged and tragged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the glip was not slogged based on these two premises alone. We need additional information or evidence to make a conclusion about whether the glip was slogged or not.",
