In this case, the condition is that the sneg was cramped. The second statement is an uncertain statement, which means it is possible but not certain that the sneg did not sprout the frink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg was not cramped based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the sneg's state of being.",
