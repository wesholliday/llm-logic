The statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have been surned, but it does not necessarily mean that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nThe statement \"It might not have been surned\" is a possibility that is not explicitly mentioned in the given information. It could be that the fleeg was bluttered and did not get surned, or it could be that the fleeg was not bluttered at all. Without more information, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"No\".",
