The fribble might not have crinked.\n\nStep 2: We want to infer whether the following statement is true or false:\n\n3. The fribble was not snurgled.\n\nStep 3: To determine whether statement 3 is true or false, we need to consider the relationship between statements 1 and 2. If statement 1 is true, then statement 2 must be false, because if the fribble was snurgled, it would have crinked by definition. On the other hand, if statement 2 is true, then statement 1 might or might not be true, depending on whether the fribble actually crinked or not.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we can infer that statement 3 is false. This is because if the fribble was snurgled and did not crinkle, then it would not have been snurgled in the first place. Therefore, the only way for statement 3 to be true is if the fribble was not snurgled at all.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
