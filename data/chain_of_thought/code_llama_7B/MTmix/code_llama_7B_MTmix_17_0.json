The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the premise (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the conclusion (the flob must have moved) is also true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is false if the premise is false.\n2. The second statement is a possibility that the flob did not move, but it does not necessarily imply that the flob was skizzled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make such an inference.",
