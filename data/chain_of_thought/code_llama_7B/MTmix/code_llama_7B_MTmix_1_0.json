This means that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it cannot be zargled.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we can conclude that the flugel might not have been zargled. This means that even if the flugel was blimmed, it is still possible that it was not zargled.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's consider the relationship between the two premises again.\n\nIf the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it cannot be zargled.\n\nHowever, we also know that the flugel might not have been zargled. This means that even if the flugel was blimmed, it is still possible that it was not zargled.\n\nStep 5: Based on these two premises, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nReasoning: We have established that the flugel might not have been zargled, and yet we know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
