To do this, we need to examine the relationships between the statements and determine if they are consistent with each other.\n\nRelationship 1: If the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. This is a logical consequence of the first premise.\nRelationship 2: The whiffle might not have tinked. This is a possibility that is not necessarily implied by the first premise.\n\nStep 3: Based on the relationships between the statements, we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" if and only if the second premise is false. If the second premise is true, then it is possible for the whiffle to have tinked even if it was shanked, which would contradict the first premise. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" from these premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
