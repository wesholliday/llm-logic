This implies that if the smonk is vreebled, it will also have plagged.\n\nThe second premise states that the smonk might not have plagged. This does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled. It could be that the smonk was vreebled but did not plag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled based on these two premises alone. We would need additional information or evidence to support such an inference.",
