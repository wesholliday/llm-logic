The first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled.\n\nThe second premise states that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not cranked. It could be that the sprocket was cranked but not daggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked based on these premises alone. We would need additional information or evidence to make such an inference.",
