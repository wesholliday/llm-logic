If the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spended by definition.\nPremise 2: This premise is also valid because it is a possibility that the dreb might not have been spended.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nSince both premises are valid, and the conclusion is a logical consequence of them, we can infer that the conclusion is true. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
