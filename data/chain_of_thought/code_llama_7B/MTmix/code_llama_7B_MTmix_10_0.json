However, this does not necessarily mean that the wug was not sproonged. The second statement simply states that it might not have been garpled, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the wug was sproonged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not sproonged based on these two statements alone. We would need additional information or evidence to make such an inference.",
