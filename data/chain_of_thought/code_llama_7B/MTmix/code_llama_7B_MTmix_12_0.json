However, this does not necessarily mean that the smip was not shripped. The second statement simply states that the smip might not have lupped the zoint, which could be due to various reasons unrelated to whether or not it was shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the smip was not shripped based on these two statements alone. We would need additional information or evidence to support such an inference.",
