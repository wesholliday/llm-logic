In this case, the conclusion is \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nStep 4: We can use logical reasoning to determine whether or not the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nLogical Reasoning:\n\n1. If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled (premise 1).\n2. The zinger might not have been smoogled (premise 2).\n3. Therefore, it is possible that the zinger was not fraggled (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
