In this case, the first premise would still be true (the wug was flooped), but the second premise would not be true (the wug might have bimmed the zoint). Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from these two premises.\n\nIn general, it is important to carefully consider the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion in order to determine whether an inference can be made.",
