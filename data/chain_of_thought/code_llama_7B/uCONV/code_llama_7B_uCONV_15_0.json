The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does not necessarily imply that the opposite is also true. It's possible that Sam and Erin could have taken different modes of transportation for personal or professional reasons.\n\nFor example, Sam could have taken a plane because it was the most convenient option for him at the time, while Erin took a train because she wanted to experience the scenery along the way. In this case, the two statements \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" are not necessarily contradictory, but they do not imply each other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.",
