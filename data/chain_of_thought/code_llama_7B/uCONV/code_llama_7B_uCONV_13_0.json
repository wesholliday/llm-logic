This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the conclusion (the car being red) does not logically follow from the premise (the truck being blue). In other words, just because one event (the truck being blue) has occurred, it does not necessarily mean that another event (the car being red) will occur.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Premise: The truck was blue.\n2. Conclusion: The car was red.\n3. Inference: If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n4. Reasoning: This is a conditional statement, where the conclusion (the car being red) does not logically follow from the premise (the truck being blue).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.",
