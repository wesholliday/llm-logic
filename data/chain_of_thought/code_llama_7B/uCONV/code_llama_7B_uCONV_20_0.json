The statement \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily imply that the opposite of the condition is true. In other words, just because the apple was red does not mean that the banana was necessarily yellow.\n\nFor example, imagine that the apple was red because it had been exposed to sunlight for a long time, while the banana was yellow because it had been grown in a greenhouse. Even though the apple was red and the banana was yellow, we cannot infer that one was the cause of the other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a logical inference that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.",
