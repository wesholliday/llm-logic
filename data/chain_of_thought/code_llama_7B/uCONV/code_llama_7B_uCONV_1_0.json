The statement \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is not necessarily true, even if it is based on the assumption that Sue and Mary were both at the wedding.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. If Sue was at the wedding, then she was present.\n2. If Sue was present, then she was at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, if Sue was at the wedding, then she was at the wedding.\n\nThis argument is based on a false assumption that Sue and Mary were both at the wedding. However, it is possible for Sue to have been at the wedding without Mary being there. In this case, the conditional syllogism would not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.",
