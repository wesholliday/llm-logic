The statement \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" does not logically imply the opposite statement \"if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nFor example, if the shirt was actually linen and the pants were denim, then the first statement would still be true (the shirt was cotton), but the second statement would not be true (the pants were not denim).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.",
