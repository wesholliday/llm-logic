The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies if the condition in the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. If the condition is false, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) may also be false, even though Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFor example, suppose Lisa did not buy the red shirt because she already had one. In this case, Mark bought the blue shirt, but Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n### Answer: No",
