The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" does not necessarily imply that the opposite is also true. It's possible that Lucy went to the zoo for a different reason than Joe going to the park.\n\nFor example, let's say that Lucy went to the zoo because she wanted to see the monkeys, but Joe went to the park because he wanted to play with his dog. Even though both actions are related to going to a place, they are not necessarily connected in this way.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.",
