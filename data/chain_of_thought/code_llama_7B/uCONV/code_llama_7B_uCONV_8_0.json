This is because there are other possible explanations for why the mummy was awake, such as it being a sentient creature with its own motivations and desires. Additionally, the mummy's awakening could have been caused by external factors, such as a magical spell or an unexpected event.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a general inference that if one creature is awake, then all creatures of the same type are also awake. It is important to consider all possible explanations and evidence before making any conclusions.",
