The first statement simply states that the assumption that the splat was morphed is not true, while the second statement suggests that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the difference:\n\nAssume that it is raining outside. It is not the case that the sky must be blue. However, this does not mean that the sky might not be blue. The first statement simply states that the assumption that the sky was blue is not true, while the second statement suggests that there is a possibility that the sky was blue.\n\nIn the same way, \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" does not logically entail \"The splat might not have been morphed.\" The first statement simply states that the assumption that the splat was morphed is not true, while the second statement suggests that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.",
