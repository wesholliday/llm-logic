In this case, the condition is \"the sprocket must have been cranked,\" which means that if the sprocket was not cranked, then the statement would be false. However, just because the statement is not true does not mean that the opposite of the condition is necessarily true.\n\nFor example, consider a conditional statement like \"If it rains, then the crops will grow.\" This statement is not necessarily true if it doesn't rain, but it does not imply that the crops will not grow if it does rain.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" that \"The sprocket might not have been cranked.\"",
