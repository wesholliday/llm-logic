For example, if we knew that the flob was a rare species that only appeared in certain locations, then it's possible that it might not have been skizzled because it was not found in those locations.\n\nTherefore, while we can make an educated guess based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" with absolute certainty from \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\"",
