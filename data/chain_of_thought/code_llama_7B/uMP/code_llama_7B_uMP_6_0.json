The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the two choices. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Sue's choice of pizza caused Bob's choice of pasta. It is possible that Bob chose pasta for other reasons unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta based on the information provided.",
