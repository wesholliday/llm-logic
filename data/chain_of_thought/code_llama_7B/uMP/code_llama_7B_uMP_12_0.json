This means that if a certain condition is met (i.e., Joe went to the park), then a different condition must also be met (i.e., Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nStep 3: We are given the second statement, which states that Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 4: Based on the first statement and the second statement, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Therefore, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
