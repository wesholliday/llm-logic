The fact that the shirt was cotton does not necessarily mean that the pants were also made of cotton. It is possible that the pants were made of a different material, such as polyester or nylon, which would make them different from the shirt.\n\nHowever, if we know that the shirt was cotton and the pants were denim, then it is more likely that the pants were also made of cotton. This is because denim is a type of fabric that is often made from cotton or a blend of cotton and other materials.\n\nTherefore, if we know that the shirt was cotton and the pants were denim, then it is more likely that the pants were also made of cotton. However, without additional information, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the material of the pants.",
