The first premise states that it is not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy could have been asleep or in any other state of being.\n2. The second premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even conclude that the vampire is asleep or in any other state of being.\n\n### Answer: No",
