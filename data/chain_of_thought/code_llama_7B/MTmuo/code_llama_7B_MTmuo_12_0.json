The first premise states that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that there is no reason to assume that Lucy did go to the zoo.\n2. The second premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then it would be reasonable to infer that Lucy also went to the zoo.\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether Joe went to the park or not. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether Lucy went to the zoo based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" together with \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"",
