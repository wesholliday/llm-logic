The first premise states that it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that there is no necessary connection between the robot visiting Jupiter and the alien visiting Mars.\n2. The second premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien did visit Mars, then it is necessary for the robot to have visited Jupiter.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that the alien may or may not have visited Mars, and that the robot may or may not have visited Jupiter.",
