The first premise states that it is not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that there is no necessary connection between Kate eating salad and her having to do so.\n2. The second premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate would have had to eat salad as well.\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that he did not eat pasta based on the second premise alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\" together with \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"",
