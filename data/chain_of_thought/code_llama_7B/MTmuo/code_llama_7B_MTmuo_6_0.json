The first premise states that it is not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that there is no necessary connection between Bob choosing pasta and the fact that he did not choose pasta.\n2. The second premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have had to choose pasta in order for the conditional statement to be true.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from these two premises. In fact, it is possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob chose something else entirely.\n\n### Answer: No",
