The first premise states that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that there is no necessary connection between the banana being yellow and the apple being red.\n2. The second premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple is red, then the banana will be yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that the apple is red in the first place.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" from these two premises. The absence of a necessary connection between the banana being yellow and the apple being red does not entail the non-existence of a possible connection between the apple being red and the banana being yellow.",
