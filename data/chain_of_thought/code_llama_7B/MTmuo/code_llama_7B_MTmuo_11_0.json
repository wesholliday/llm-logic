The first premise states that it is not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the muffins could have been any flavor, including chocolate.\n2. The second premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n3. However, we are not given any information about the cake's flavor. Therefore, it could be either chocolate or any other flavor.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the two premises.",
