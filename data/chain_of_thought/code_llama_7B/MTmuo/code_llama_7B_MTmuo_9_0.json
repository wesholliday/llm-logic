The first statement says \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" which is a tautology and does not provide any information about whether Mark actually bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nThe second statement, on the other hand, states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This implies that Mark did buy the blue shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In fact, we cannot infer anything about Lisa's purchases based on this information alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt from the given statements.",
