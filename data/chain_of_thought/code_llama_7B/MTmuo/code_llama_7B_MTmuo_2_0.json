This means that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn cannot be in the forest either.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we can infer that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nStep 4: We are given that the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can conclude that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
