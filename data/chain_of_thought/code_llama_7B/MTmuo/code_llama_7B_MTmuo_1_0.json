The first premise states that it is not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that there is no logical reason to conclude that Sue was not at the wedding.\n2. The second premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is necessary that Sue was also at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that Mary may have been at the wedding or that Sue may have been at the wedding but not both.\n\n### Answer: No",
