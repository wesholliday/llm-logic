The first premise states that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that there is no reason to assume that the pants were denim.\n2. The second premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then it is likely that the pants were denim. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these two premises. The first premise does not provide enough information to make such an inference.",
