The first premise states that it is not the case that the book must be a mystery novel, which means that there is no guarantee that the book is a mystery novel. The second premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This premise is conditional, meaning that it only applies if the book was written by James. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
