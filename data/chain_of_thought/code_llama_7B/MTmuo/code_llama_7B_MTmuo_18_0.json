The first premise states that the truck was not made of metal, while the second premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This does not necessarily imply that the doll was not plastic.\n\nFor example, suppose the truck was actually a wooden one, and the doll was made of plastic. In this case, both premises would be true, but we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic from them.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The doll was not plastic\" is not logically supported by the given premises.",
