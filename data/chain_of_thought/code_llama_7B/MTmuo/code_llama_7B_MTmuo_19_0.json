            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from \"Jen must have watched basketball\" and \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement that does not logically entail its contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A,\" but this does not necessarily follow from the original statement.\n\nFor instance, if it rains, then the grass will be wet. However, if the grass is not wet, it does not necessarily mean that it did not rain. Similarly, if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. But if Jen did not watch basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from \"Jen must have watched basketball\" and \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"",
