The first premise states that it is not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means that there is no necessary connection between the color of the truck and its being blue.\n2. The second premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car was red, then it is necessarily true that the truck must have been blue.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The car was not red\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that the car could have been any color, including red.\n\n### Answer: No",
