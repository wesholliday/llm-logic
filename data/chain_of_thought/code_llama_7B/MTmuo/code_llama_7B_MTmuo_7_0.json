The first premise states that it is not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that there is no necessary connection between Chris finishing the race and the fact that Alex did not finish the race.\n2. The second premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris would also have finished the race.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that Chris may or may not have finished the race, depending on whether or not Alex finished the race.",
