It only means that there are other possibilities besides the notebook being in the drawer.\n\nFor example, we might have additional information that suggests the notebook is not in the drawer, such as a note from someone who has already checked the drawer and confirmed that it's not there. In this case, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" would still be true, even though we have additional information that contradicts the possibility of the notebook being in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" that the notebook might or might not be in the drawer. We need to consider other factors and evidence before making any conclusions about the notebook's location.",
