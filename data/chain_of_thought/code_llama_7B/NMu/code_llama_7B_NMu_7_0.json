The first statement simply states that it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race, while the second statement asserts that Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nTo infer \"Alex might not have finished the race\" from \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race,\" we would need to know more information about the situation. For example, if we knew that Alex had started the race and was still in contention, but then encountered an obstacle or lost their way, it might be reasonable to infer that they did not finish the race. However, without this additional information, we cannot make a definitive inference about whether or not Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
