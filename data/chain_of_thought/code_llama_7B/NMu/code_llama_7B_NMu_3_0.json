In other words, just because it is not the case that the book must have been written by James, it does not follow that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nFor example, if I say \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James,\" this does not mean that the book was definitely written by someone else. It could still be the case that the book was written by James, but it is also possible that it was written by someone else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" that the book might not have been written by James. We need more information or evidence to make such an inference.",
