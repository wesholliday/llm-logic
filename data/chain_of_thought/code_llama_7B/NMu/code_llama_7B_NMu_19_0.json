It only means that there is no necessary connection between the watch being charged on the dresser and the fact that the watch is not working properly.\n\nFor example, if we know that the watch is not working properly because it was dropped, then it does not necessarily mean that it was charging on the dresser when it was dropped. Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\n### Answer: No",
