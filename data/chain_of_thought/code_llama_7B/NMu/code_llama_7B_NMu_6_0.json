It could simply mean that there is no evidence to suggest that Sue chose pizza.\n\nFor example, if we know that Sue did not order pizza at a restaurant, but we don't know whether she chose something else, then the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" would still be true, even though we cannot infer that she didn't choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza based on the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"",
