The first statement simply states that the condition of the vampire being awake is not necessary for the event to occur, while the second statement asserts that the vampire was not necessarily awake.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" means that there is no necessary connection between the vampire being awake and the event occurring.\n2. \"The vampire might not have been awake\" is a possible interpretation of the first statement, but it is not logically entailed by it.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The vampire might not have been awake\" from \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\"",
