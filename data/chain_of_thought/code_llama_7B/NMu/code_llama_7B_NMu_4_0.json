In this context, \"not the case\" means that the opposite of what is being asserted is true. So if we say \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars,\" we are asserting that it is possible for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider what it would mean for us to infer that the alien might not have visited Mars based on this statement. If we were to infer that the alien might not have visited Mars, we would be making an assumption about the alien's possible actions based on a logical contradiction. This is not a valid inference, as it relies on a false premise (the logical contradiction).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien might not have visited Mars based on the statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\"",
