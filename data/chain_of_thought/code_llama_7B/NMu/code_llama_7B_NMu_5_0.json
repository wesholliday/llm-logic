It could simply mean that there is no evidence to suggest that Jeff played basketball.\n\nFor example, if we know that Jeff has never been seen playing basketball, then it would be a reasonable inference to make that he did not play basketball. However, if we have no information about Jeff's basketball skills or whether he has ever played the sport, then it is not possible to make such an inference.\n\nTherefore, while \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" does not necessarily mean that Jeff did not play basketball, it does suggest that there may be some doubt about his basketball abilities.",
