The first statement simply states that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, while the second statement asserts that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of why we cannot infer the second statement from the first:\n\n1. The first statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is a negative statement, which means it asserts that there is no necessary connection between the premise and the conclusion.\n2. The second statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means it asserts that if the premise is true, then the conclusion will also be true.\n3. Since the first statement does not logically entail the second, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. This is because the first statement simply states that there is no necessary connection between the premise and the conclusion, while the second statement asserts a conditional relationship between them.",
