This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The consequent of an if-then statement is the statement that follows the \"if\" part, and it is not necessarily true just because the antecedent (the statement before the \"if\") is false.\n\nFor example, if it is not raining, then the grass will be dry. However, this does not mean that the grass will be dry even if it is raining. The consequent is only true if the antecedent is true, and the antecedent can be false even if the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest based on the fact that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.",
