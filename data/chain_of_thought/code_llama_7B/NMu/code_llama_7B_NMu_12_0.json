In other words, just because the condition is not met, it does not necessarily follow that the consequent is false.\n\nFor example, if I say \"It's not the case that the sky is blue,\" this statement does not mean that the sky is not blue. It simply means that there is no necessary connection between the two statements. Similarly, if I say \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair,\" this statement does not necessarily entail that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.",
