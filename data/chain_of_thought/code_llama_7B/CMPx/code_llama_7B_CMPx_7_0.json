    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

The statement \"the nivet likely won't\" is based on the assumption that the nivet will not lead births, which may not be true. Additionally, the fact that the crastin likely will lead births does not necessarily mean that the jomial will not lead births as well.\n\nHere's a counterexample:\n\nSuppose that the crastin leads births with 10 offspring, the nivet leads births with 5 offspring, and the jomial leads births with 2 offspring. In this case, it is likely that the crastin will lead births, but it is not necessarily true that the jomial will not lead births.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will.",
