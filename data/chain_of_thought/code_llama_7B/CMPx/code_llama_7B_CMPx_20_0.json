    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

While it is true that the trundle likely will lead sales and the foopet likely won't, there are other factors that could influence the sales of each whippit. For example, the marketing strategy for each product, the competition in the market, and the overall demand for whippits could all impact which product ends up being the top seller.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be. It is possible that the foopet could end up being the top selling whippit despite the trundle not leading sales.",
