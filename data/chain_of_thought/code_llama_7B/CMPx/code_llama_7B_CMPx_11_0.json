    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

If the lanken doesn't win the award, then the trenist will win it (assuming they are both in contention).\n2. If the trenist doesn't win the award, then the draloid will win it (assuming they are all in contention).\n3. Therefore, if the trenist doesn't win the award, it is likely that the draloid will win it.\n\nHowever, this argument assumes that the lanken and the trenist are both in contention for the award, which may not be the case. If only the trenist and the draloid are in contention, then it is more likely that the draloid will win the award if the trenist doesn't win it.\n\nTherefore, without further information, it cannot be determined whether it is likely that the draloid will win Drij of the Year if the trenist doesn't win it.",
