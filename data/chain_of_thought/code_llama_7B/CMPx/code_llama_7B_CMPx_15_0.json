    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

While it is true that the dribban and snorpul are both longshots, the oddsmakers have given them a lower probability of winning than the fantole, which makes them more likely to win. Additionally, the fact that the fantole is the best-odds contender does not necessarily mean that it will win, as there may be other factors at play that could affect its chances.\n\n### Answer: No",
