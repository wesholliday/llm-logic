    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

The statement \"if the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle\" does not necessarily imply that it is likely that the tomul will be named snarggle if the crinel isn't.\n\nFor example, suppose that the nafiz and the tomul are both equally skilled at snarggling, and that the crinel is much more skilled than either of them. In this case, it is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle, regardless of whether the nafiz or the tomul is also named snarggle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that, if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be. We need to consider other factors as well, such as the skill level of each candidate and their chances of being selected for the team.",
