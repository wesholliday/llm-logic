    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

If the loperit doesn't win, then the frallon will win (under the assumption that the frallon is a heavy underdog).\n2. If the fantug doesn't win, then the loperit won't (since the fantug is the front runner and the loperit is a close second).\n3. Therefore, if the fantug doesn't win, it is likely that the frallon will win (since the frallon is a heavy underdog and the loperit is unlikely to win).\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the information provided. The fact that the frallon is a heavy underdog does not necessarily mean that it is more likely to win than the fantug or the loperit. It could be that all three products are evenly matched and have an equal chance of winning.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether it is likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will.",
