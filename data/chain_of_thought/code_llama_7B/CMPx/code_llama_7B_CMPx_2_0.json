    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

This is because there are other factors at play here, such as the relative qualifications of each applicant and the specific requirements of the zulision. Just because the jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant and the cramen has weaker qualifications, it does not mean that the sulect will automatically get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't.\n\nIn fact, there could be other factors at play here that would affect the outcome. For example, the hiring manager may have a preference for candidates with certain skills or experience, regardless of their qualifications. Additionally, the process of evaluating applications and making hiring decisions is not always straightforward, and there may be other factors that are taken into consideration beyond just qualifications.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to make a simple inference about the likelihood of the sulect getting the zulision based solely on the relative qualifications of the three applicants.",
