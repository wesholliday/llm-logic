    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

The argument is based on the assumption that the crongle won't bafwidge the most, which is not necessarily true. If the crongle does bafwidge the most, then it would be unlikely for the narzil to bafwidge the most, even if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most.\n\nHere's a counterexample: suppose that the blimfet, crongle, and narzil all have equal chances of bafwiding the most. In this case, it would be possible for the narzil to bafwidge the most even if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that it's likely that, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.",
