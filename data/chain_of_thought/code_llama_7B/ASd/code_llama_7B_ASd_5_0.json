However, it does not necessarily mean that if the check bounces, the services will continue. The check bouncing could be due to a variety of reasons unrelated to the payment of the bill, and it may not affect the continuation of the services.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue\" from \"If the bill is paid, then the services will continue.\"",
