The statement \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" implies that the match will only light if it is struck, without any other conditions or circumstances. However, the statement does not mention anything about soaking the match in water, which could potentially affect its ability to light. Therefore, we cannot infer that the match will light even if it has been soaked in water based on this statement alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
