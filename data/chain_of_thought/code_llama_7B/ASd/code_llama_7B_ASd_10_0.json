The statement \"If the order is placed, then the item will ship\" implies that if an order is placed, the item will be shipped regardless of whether it is in stock or not. However, the statement does not provide any information about the availability of the item before the order is placed. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, it will ship based solely on this statement.\n\n### Answer: No",
