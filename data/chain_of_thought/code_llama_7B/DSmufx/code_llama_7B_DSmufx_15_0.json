The first premise states that either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed. This means that if the dreb is not spent, then it must be vroombed.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the dreb must be spent. This means that the dreb can be spent without being vroombed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dreb is vroombed from these two premises. In fact, we have evidence that the dreb can be spent without being vroombed.\n\n### Answer: No",
