The first premise states that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. This means that there are two possible cases: (a) the splat must be quanked, or (b) the splat is morphed.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked. This means that the first premise cannot be true in its entirety.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the splat must be quanked, since the second premise rules out the possibility of it being morphed.\n\n### Answer: No",
