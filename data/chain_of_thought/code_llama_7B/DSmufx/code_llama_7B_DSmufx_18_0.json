The first premise states that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked. This means that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged. This means that the shank can be either nugged or plooked, but it cannot be both.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The shank is plooked\" from these two premises. The first premise only allows us to conclude that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked, but it does not guarantee that the shank is actually plooked.\n\n### Answer: No",
