The first premise states that either the sneg must be sproted or it is cramped. This means that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be cramped.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the sneg must be sproted. This means that the sneg can be sproted even if it is not required to do so.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sneg is cramped based on these two premises alone. The first premise only establishes a necessary condition for the sneg to be cramped, while the second premise negates this condition.\n\n### Answer: No",
