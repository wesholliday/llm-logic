The first premise states that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. This means that there are two possible outcomes for the zinger: it can be smoogled or it can be fraggled.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This means that the zinger cannot be smoogled, regardless of whether it is fraggled or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zinger is fraggled based on these two premises alone. The first premise only provides information about the possible outcomes for the zinger, while the second premise states that the zinger cannot be smoogled.\n\n### Answer: No",
