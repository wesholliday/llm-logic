The first premise states that either the flob must be moved or it is skizzled. This means that if the flob is not moved, it must be skizzled.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the flob must be moved. This means that the flob can be moved without being skizzled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flob is skizzled based on these two premises. In fact, we have no reason to believe that the flob is skizzled at all.",
