The first premise states that either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled. This means that there are two possible outcomes for the fribble: it can be crinked or it can be snurgled.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This means that the fribble cannot be crinked, regardless of whether it is snurgled or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble is snurgled based on these two premises alone. The first premise only provides information about the possible outcomes for the fribble, while the second premise tells us that one of those outcomes (crinkling) is not possible.\n\n### Answer: No",
