The first premise states that either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped. This means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the smip must be lupped. This means that the smip can be lupped even if it is not logically necessary to do so.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The smip is shripped\" from these two premises. The first premise only establishes a logical possibility for the smip's state, while the second premise allows for other possibilities.",
