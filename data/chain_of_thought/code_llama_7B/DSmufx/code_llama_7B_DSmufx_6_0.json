The first premise, \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed,\" states that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This means that there are two possible outcomes for the grommet: it can be plopped or it can be sploffed.\n2. The second premise, \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped,\" states that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped. This means that there is no requirement for the grommet to be plopped.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from these two premises. The first premise states that the grommet can be either plopped or sploffed, while the second premise states that there is no requirement for the grommet to be plopped. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the grommet is sploffed.\n\n### Answer: No",
