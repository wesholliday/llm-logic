The first premise states that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the glip must be tragged. This means that the glip can be tragged or it can be slogged, but it cannot be both.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The glip is slogged\" from these two premises. The first premise implies that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged, while the second premise states that the glip can be tragged or it can be slogged, but it cannot be both. These two statements are contradictory, so we cannot logically infer \"The glip is slogged\" from them.\n\n### Answer: No",
