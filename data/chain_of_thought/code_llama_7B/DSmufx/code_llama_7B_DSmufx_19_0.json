The first premise states that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This means that the smonk cannot be plagged, regardless of whether it is vreebled or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the smonk is vreebled in general. It could simply be that the smonk is not plagged and therefore not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\" together with \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\"",
