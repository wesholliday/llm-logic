The first premise states that either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed. This means that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the flugel must be zargled. This means that the flugel can be zargled without necessarily being blimmed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the flugel may not even be blimmed at all.\n\n### Answer: No",
