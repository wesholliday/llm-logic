The first premise states that either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered. This means that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the fleeg must be surned. This means that the fleeg may not need to be surned in order for it to be bluttered.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered based on these two premises alone. The first premise only establishes a necessary condition for the fleeg to be bluttered, while the second premise negates this condition.\n\n### Answer: No",
