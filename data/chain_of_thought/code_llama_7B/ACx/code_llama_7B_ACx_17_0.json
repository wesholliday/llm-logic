Therefore, we cannot infer that the flob was skizzled from the fact that the flob moved.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\nNo, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The conclusion is a statement about the flob's past state, while the premises are statements about the flob's current state. Therefore, it is not possible to infer the conclusion from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
