The premise \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" implies that if the fleeg was bluttered (i.e., had its wings blunted), then it would have surned (i.e., flown away).\n2. The conclusion \"The fleeg surned\" states that the fleeg did in fact fly away, which contradicts the premise.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was bluttered\" from \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" and \"The fleeg surned.\"\n\n### Answer: No",
