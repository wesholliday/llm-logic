If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled. (Premise 1)\n2. The wug was garpled. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, if the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nIn this case, we can determine that the conclusion \"The wug was sproonged\" does not logically follow from the premises \"If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was garpled.\" This is because the conclusion is a specific instance of the premise \"If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled,\" while the premises are general statements about the wug's behavior. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug was sproonged from the premises alone.\n\nStep 5: Write your answer.\nAnswer: No.",
