If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. (Premise 1)\n2. The whiffle tinked. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the whiffle was shanked. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the argument using logical reasoning.\nWe can evaluate the validity of the argument using logical reasoning as follows:\n\n1. The conclusion \"The whiffle was shanked\" logically follows from the premises \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" and \"The whiffle tinked.\" (Conclusion)\n2. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The whiffle was shanked' from 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' together with 'The whiffle tinked'?\" is yes.",
