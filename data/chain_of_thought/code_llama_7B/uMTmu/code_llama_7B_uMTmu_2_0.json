In this case, the antecedent is \"the griffin was in the forest.\" If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn could have been anywhere, and we cannot infer anything about its location based on the fact that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"",
