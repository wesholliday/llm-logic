It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have had to eat salad (by the first statement). However, since it is not the case that Kate must have eaten salad (as stated in the second statement), it follows that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
