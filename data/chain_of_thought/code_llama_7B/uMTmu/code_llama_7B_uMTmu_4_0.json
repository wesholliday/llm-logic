(Premise 1)\n* It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. (Negated Premise 2)\n\nWe can infer that the alien did not visit Mars if we can show that:\n\n1. The negation of Premise 1 is true, and\n2. Premise 2 is false.\n\nTo prove the first point, let's assume that the negation of Premise 1 is true. This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. If this is the case, then we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars, since the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nTo prove the second point, let's assume that Premise 2 is false. This means that it is possible for the robot to have visited Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars. If this is the case, then we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars, since the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, if the negation of Premise 1 and Premise 2 are both true, then we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n### Answer:\n\nYes",
