It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that:\n\n1. If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n2. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then she did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n1. If Joe did not go to the park, then he did not go to the zoo.\n2. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then she did not go to the park.\n\nNow, let's consider the given information:\n\n* Joe went to the park.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that:\n\n1. Joe did go to the park.\n2. If Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n3. Therefore, Lucy did go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, we also know that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n2. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then she did not go to the park.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Joe did not go to the park?\n\nYes, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park because if he did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo, and it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.",
