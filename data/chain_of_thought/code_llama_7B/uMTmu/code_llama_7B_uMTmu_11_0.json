The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the cake was chocolate and the muffins were not blueberry. However, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the fact that the muffins were not blueberry. This is because there could be other possibilities for the muffins' flavor that do not involve blueberry.\n\n### Answer: No",
