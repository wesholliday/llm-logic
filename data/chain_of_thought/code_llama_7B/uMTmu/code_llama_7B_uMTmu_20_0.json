In this case, it asserts that the banana cannot be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the first part of the statement: \"If the apple was red.\" This statement asserts that the apple was red.\n\nBased on these three statements, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on this information alone. In fact, it's possible that the apple was not red and the banana was still yellow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based solely on the given information.",
