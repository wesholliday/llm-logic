Therefore, we cannot infer that Q(B) is true or false.\n\nHowever, if P(B) is true, then it is possible that Q(B) is false. For example, the book could be written by James but not be a mystery novel. This is because the proposition \"the book was written by James\" does not entail the proposition \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on the information provided. We need more information to make a conclusion about this.\n\n### Answer: No",
