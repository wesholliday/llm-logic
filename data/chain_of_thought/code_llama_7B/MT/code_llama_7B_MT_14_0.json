This means that if the bear is in the cave, it implies that the wolf is also in the den.\n\nStep 4: The second premise states that the wolf was not in the den. This contradicts the first premise, as it implies that the wolf is not in the den.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave based on these two premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
