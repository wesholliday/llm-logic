This means that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"The muffins were not blueberry\". This contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the muffins were blueberry even though the first statement states they cannot be blueberry if the cake is chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.",
