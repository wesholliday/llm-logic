The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether we can infer that \"The book was not written by James\" from these two statements. To do this, we need to analyze the relationships between the statements and see if they are consistent with each other.\n\nStep 3: The first statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n\nStep 4: The second statement states that the book is not a mystery novel. This contradicts with the first statement, as it implies that the book was written by James and is therefore a mystery novel.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that \"The book was not written by James\" from these two statements. This is because the first statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but the second statement states that the book is not a mystery novel, which contradicts with this assumption.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
