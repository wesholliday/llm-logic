This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nStep 3: We are also given the fact that Erin did not take a train. This means that she did not take a train, regardless of whether or not Sam took a plane.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane, because if he had taken a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. However, since Erin did not take a train, it follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
