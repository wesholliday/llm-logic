This means that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck cannot be metal.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"The truck was not metal\". This contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the truck is not metal even if the doll is plastic.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
