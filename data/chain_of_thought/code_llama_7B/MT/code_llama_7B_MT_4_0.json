            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien visited Mars, there must be a connection between the two planets such that the robot was able to visit Jupiter as well.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars. This is because if the alien had visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter as well, but since the robot did not visit Jupiter, it follows that the alien did not visit Mars either.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
