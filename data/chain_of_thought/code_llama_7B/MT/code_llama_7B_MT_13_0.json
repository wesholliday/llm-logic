In this case, the condition is that the car was red.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an affirmative statement, which means that it asserts something to be true. In this case, it states that the truck was not blue.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the car was not red because if the car was red and the truck was blue, then the conditional statement would imply that the truck was not blue, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
