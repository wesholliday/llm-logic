This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo as well.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This contradicts the assumption made in step 2, which implies that Lucy did go to the zoo if Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
