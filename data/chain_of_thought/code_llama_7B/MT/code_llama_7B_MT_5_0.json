This means that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 5: The second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. This means that Amy did not play tennis, regardless of whether or not Jeff played basketball.\n\nStep 6: Based on the information given, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball because if he had played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis. However, since Amy did not play tennis, it follows that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
