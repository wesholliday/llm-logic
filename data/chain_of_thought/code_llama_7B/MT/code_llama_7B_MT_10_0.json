In this case, the antecedent is \"If the dog was inside,\" and the consequent is \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nStep 3: The second statement is a negative statement, which means that if the statement is false, then it must be true. In this case, the statement is \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the dog was inside based on the first statement and the fact that the cat was not outside. This is because if the dog was inside and the cat was outside, then the first statement would be true, but since the second statement is false, we know that the dog must have been inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The dog was inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' together with 'The cat was not outside'?\" is yes.",
