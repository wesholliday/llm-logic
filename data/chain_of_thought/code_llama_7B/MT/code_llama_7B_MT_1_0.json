This means that if Mary is not at the wedding, then Sue is not at the wedding either.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"Sue was not at the wedding\". This contradicts the first statement, as it implies that Sue was at the wedding even though she was not.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
