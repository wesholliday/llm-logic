This implies that the pants are not denim.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the pants were not denim.\n\nStep 4: Based on the two statements, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim, but since the pants are not denim, it follows that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' together with 'The pants were not denim'?\" is yes.",
