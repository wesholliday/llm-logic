The first premise states that the flight was not blummed (i.e., it did not happen).\n2. The second premise states that if the flight was blummed (i.e., it happened), then it was zimmed (i.e., it was done).\n3. The conclusion states that the flight was not zimmed (i.e., it was not done).\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premises because there is no logical connection between the two premises. If the first premise is true, then the second premise may or may not be true, and vice versa. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the flight was not zimmed based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
