The first premise states that \"the grommet did not sploff.\" The second premise is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" Based on these premises, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, it would have plopped the frink. Therefore, since the grommet did not sploff, it is likely that it did not plop the frink.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
