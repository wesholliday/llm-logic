The first premise states that the dreb was not vroombed. This means that the dreb did not have its wheels vroomed.\n2. The second premise states that if the dreb had its wheels vroomed, then the dreb was spended. This means that if the dreb's wheels were vroomed, it would be spent.\n3. However, we are given the first premise that the dreb was not vroombed. This means that the dreb did not have its wheels vroomed, and therefore it cannot be inferred that the dreb was spended.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not spended\" from \"The dreb was not vroombed\" and \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\"",
