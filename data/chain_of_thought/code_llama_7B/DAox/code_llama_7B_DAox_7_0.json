To do this, we need to consider the possible outcomes of each premise and their logical relationships.\n\nPremise 1: The whiffle was not shanked. This means that the whiffle did not have a sharp edge or point, which is consistent with the fact that it did not tink.\n\nPremise 2: If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. This premise implies that if the whiffle had a sharp edge or point, it would have tinked. However, we know from Premise 1 that the whiffle did not have a sharp edge or point, so this premise is not applicable in this case.\n\nStep 3: Based on our analysis, we can conclude that we cannot infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from the given premises. This is because Premise 2 is not applicable in this case, and we have already established that the whiffle did not have a sharp edge or point based on Premise 1.\n\n### Answer: No",
