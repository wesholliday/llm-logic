The statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" does not necessarily mean that the smip did not lup the zoint if it was not shripped.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning:\n\n1. The given information is \"The smip was not shripped.\" This means that the smip was not shrunk, which means that it did not have its size reduced.\n2. The second statement is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This statement implies that if the smip was shrunk, then it would lick the zoint. However, we know from step 1 that the smip was not shrunk.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smip did not lup the zoint based on the given information. The second statement only applies if the smip was shrunk, and we know that it was not shrunk.\n\n### Answer: No",
