The first premise states that the clug was not fleeked. This means that it is possible for the clug to have been snugged without being fleeked.\n2. The second premise states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged. This means that if the clug was fleeked, it would necessarily be the case that the clug snugged.\n3. However, we are given no information about whether the clug was fleeked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug was not snugged based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not snugged\" from \"The clug was not fleeked\" together with \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"",
