The first premise states that the sprocket was not cranked, and the second premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nFor example, suppose the sprocket was cranked but not daggled. In this case, the first premise would be true (the sprocket was not cranked), but the second premise would also be true (if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled). Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not daggled from these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The sprocket was not daggled\" is not logically implied by the given premises.",
