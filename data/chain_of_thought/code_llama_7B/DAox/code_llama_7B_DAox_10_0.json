The first premise states that the wug was not sproonged, and the second premise states that if the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled. However, these two premises do not necessarily imply that the wug was not garpled.\n\nFor example, suppose the wug was sproonged but not garpled. In this case, the first premise would still be true (the wug was not sproonged), but the second premise would not be true (the wug was not garpled). Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not garpled based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
