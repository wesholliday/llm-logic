It does not necessarily mean that the glip was not tragged, as \"tragged\" can have a broader meaning than just being dragged or pulled along the ground.\n\nOn the other hand, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" means that if the glip was dragged or pulled along the ground, then it must also be tragged (i.e., it must have been dragged or pulled along the ground). This statement does not necessarily entail that the glip was not tragged, as there may be other ways in which the glip could have been tragged without being slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that the glip was not tragged.",
