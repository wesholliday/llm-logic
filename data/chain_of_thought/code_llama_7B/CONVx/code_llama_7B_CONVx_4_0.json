The conclusion states that if the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled, but this is not necessarily true. For example, it could be that the fribble crinked and then later became snurgled.\n\nStep 3: Explain why the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked, but this is not a necessary condition for the fribble to become snurgled. The fribble could have been snurgled without first being snurgled.\n\nAnswer: No",
