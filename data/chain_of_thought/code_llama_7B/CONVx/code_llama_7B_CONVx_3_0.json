The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nThe first statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" implies that if the splat was transformed into a different form, it would also produce a quanking sound. This is a causal relationship between the two events.\n\nOn the other hand, the second statement \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" implies that if the splat produced a quanking sound, it must have been transformed into a different form before doing so. This is not necessarily true, as the sound of the splat could have been produced by other means, such as being hit or thrown in a certain way.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the second statement logically follows from the first one.",
