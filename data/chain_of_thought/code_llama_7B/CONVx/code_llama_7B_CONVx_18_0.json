The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nThe first statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the premise (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the conclusion (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the premise is \"If the shank was plooked,\" and the conclusion is \"Then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nThe second statement \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked\" is also a conditional statement, but it is the opposite of the first statement. It means that if the conclusion (the part after the \"then\") is true, then the premise (the part before the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"If the shank was nugged,\" and the premise is \"Then the shank was plooked.\"\n\nWhile both statements are conditional statements, they have different meanings and are not logically equivalent. The first statement implies that if something is plooked, then it will also be nugged, while the second statement implies that if something is nugged, then it will also be plooked. These two statements do not contradict each other, but they have different implications and are not interchangeable.",
