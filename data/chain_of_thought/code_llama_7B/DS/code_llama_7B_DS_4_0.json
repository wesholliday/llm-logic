The first statement suggests that either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom. The second statement states that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. Based on these two statements, we can infer that if the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
