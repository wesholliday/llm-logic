The first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. The second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. Based on these two premises, we can infer that if the book isn't resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
