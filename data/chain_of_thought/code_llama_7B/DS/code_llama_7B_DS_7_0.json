This means that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. This contradicts with the first statement, as we have just established that the umbrella cannot be in the closet if it is not there.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
