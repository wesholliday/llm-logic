The first premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch. The second premise states that the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch. Based on these two premises, we can infer that if the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
