This means that if the shoes are not in the closet, then they are lined up by the door.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the shoes aren't lined up by the door. This contradicts with the first statement, as it implies that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
