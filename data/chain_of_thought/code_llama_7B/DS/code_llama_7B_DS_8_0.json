The remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. (Given statement)\n2. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch. (Given statement)\n3. If the remote control is on the coffee table, then it cannot be hiding under the couch.\n4. Therefore, if the remote control is not on the coffee table, then it must be hiding under the couch.\n5. Since we know that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch, we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
