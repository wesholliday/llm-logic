This can be written as \"If the toy is not in the toy box, then it is sitting on the shelf.\"\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the toy is not sitting on the shelf.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be sitting on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\n### Answer: Yes",
