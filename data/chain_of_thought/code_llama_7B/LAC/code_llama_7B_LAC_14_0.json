            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and \"The wolf was in the den\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies something only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that the wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 4: We want to know whether we can logically infer that the bear was in the cave based on these two statements.\n\nStep 5: To determine this, we need to look at the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nStep 6: We also know that the wolf was in the den based on the second statement.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we can logically infer that the bear was not in the cave based on these two statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
