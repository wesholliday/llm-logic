This means that if the alien did visit Mars, it is likely that the robot also visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 4: Based on the first and second statements, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, if the robot visited Jupiter, it is likely that the alien also visited Mars.\n\nStep 5: We have established a logical inference from the given statements. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we logically infer 'The alien visited Mars'?\" is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
