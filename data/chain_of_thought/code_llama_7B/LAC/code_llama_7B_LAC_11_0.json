            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The muffins were blueberry\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the cake was chocolate,\" and the consequent is \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it simply states a fact without any conditions or implications. In this case, the statement is \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nStep 4: We can logically infer \"The cake was chocolate\" from the first statement because if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, if \"If the cake was chocolate,\" is true, then \"The muffins were blueberry\" must also be true. Since we know that \"The muffins were blueberry\" is true, and the antecedent is true, it follows that \"The cake was chocolate\" must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can logically infer \"The cake was chocolate\" from the two statements given.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
