            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies something only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is true regardless of any conditions. In this case, the statement is \"The truck was metal\".\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the truck was metal because we have been given a factual statement about the truck's materiality.\n\nStep 5: Based on the conditional statement and the unconditional statement, we can logically infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, we are not given any information about the doll's materiality, so we cannot logically infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot logically infer \"The doll was plastic\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal\".",
