If the condition is true and the implication is false, then we cannot logically infer the conclusion. However, if the condition is false or the implication is true, then we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\nStep 6: In this case, we need to determine whether the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true or false. If it is true, then we can logically infer that Mark bought the blue shirt, but we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nStep 7: However, if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false, then we can logically infer that Mark bought the blue shirt and Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
