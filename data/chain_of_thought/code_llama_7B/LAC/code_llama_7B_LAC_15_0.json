In this case, the antecedent is \"If Sam took a plane\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an assertion, which means that it is a fact that Erin took a train.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that if the first statement is true (i.e., if Sam took a plane), then the second statement must also be true (i.e., Erin took a train). This is because the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can logically infer \"Sam took a plane\" from the given statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
