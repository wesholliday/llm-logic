This means that if the vampire was awake, it would logically follow that the mummy was also awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that the vampire was actually awake.\n\nThe second premise states that the mummy was awake. This is a factual statement and has no bearing on whether or not the vampire was actually awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The vampire was awake\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not follow logically from the given premises.",
