If the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. Since we know that the unicorn was indeed in the forest, and the conditional statement implies that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, it follows that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we logically infer 'The griffin was in the forest' from 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' together with 'The unicorn was in the forest'?\" is yes.",
