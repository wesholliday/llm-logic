            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a certain outcome if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding\", and the outcome is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that Mary was at the wedding because of the conditional statement. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also have been at the wedding. Since Sue was at the wedding, it follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
