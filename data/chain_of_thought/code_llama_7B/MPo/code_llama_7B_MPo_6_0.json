The statement \"Sue chose pizza\" and \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" do not necessarily imply that Bob chose pasta. It is possible that Bob chose something else, or that there was no choice made by either person.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements: \"Sue chose pizza\" and \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n2. The first statement states that Sue chose pizza.\n3. The second statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n4. However, we are not given any information about what Sue or Bob actually chose.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta based on the information provided.",
