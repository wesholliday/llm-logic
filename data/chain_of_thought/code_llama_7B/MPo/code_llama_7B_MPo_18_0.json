The statement \"The doll was plastic\" does not provide any information about the material of the truck. It only provides a piece of information about the doll. Similarly, the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between the two objects based on their materials, but it does not provide any information about the material of the truck. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was metal based on this information alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
