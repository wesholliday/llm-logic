The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The vampire was awake (Premise 1)\n2. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake (Conclusion)\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The mummy could have been asleep and the vampire could have woken it up without the mummy being awake. In other words, there are other possible explanations for the mummy's state that do not involve the vampire's awakening.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The mummy was awake\" from \"The vampire was awake\" and \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"",
