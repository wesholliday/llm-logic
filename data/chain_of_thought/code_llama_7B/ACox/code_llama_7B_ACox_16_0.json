The premise \"The grommet was plopped\" is true.\n2. The conclusion \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped\" is also true.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The grommet was sploffed.\"\n\nIn other words, just because a conclusion follows from a premise, it does not mean that the premise must be true. In this case, the premise \"The grommet was plopped\" is false, and therefore we cannot infer that \"The grommet was sploffed.\"",
