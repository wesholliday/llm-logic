The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Premise 1: \"The twonk was varnished\"\n2. Premise 2: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\"\n3. Conclusion: \"The twonk was plinked\"\n\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premise \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is a conditional statement that only implies that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. It does not necessarily mean that the twonk was actually plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The twonk was plinked\" from \"The twonk was varnished\" and \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"",
