The first premise states that the wug was garpled.\n2. The second premise states that if the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies when the condition is true. In this case, the condition is that the wug was sproonged.\n3. The conclusion states that the wug was sproonged. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. It is possible that the wug was garpled but not sproonged, or that it was sproonged but not garpled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The wug was sproonged\" from \"The wug was garpled\" together with \"If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\"",
