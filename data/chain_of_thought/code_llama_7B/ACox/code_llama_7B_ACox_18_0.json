The premise \"The sprocket was daggled\" does not logically entail that the sprocket was cranked. Daggling a sprocket is a process that can be done for various reasons, and it doesn't necessarily mean that the sprocket was cranked.\n2. The premise \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is not necessarily true. It is possible that the sprocket was daggled for a reason other than being cranked.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from \"The sprocket was daggled\" and \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is an example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\n### Answer: No",
