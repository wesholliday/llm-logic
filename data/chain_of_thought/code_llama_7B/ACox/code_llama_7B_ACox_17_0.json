The first premise states that the whiffle was tinked.\n2. The second premise states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it was also tinked.\n3. From these two premises, we cannot infer that the whiffle was shanked. In fact, we can deduce that the whiffle was not shanked because the second premise only states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it was also tinked. It does not say that the whiffle was shanked in this case.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The whiffle was shanked\" cannot be logically inferred from the given premises.",
