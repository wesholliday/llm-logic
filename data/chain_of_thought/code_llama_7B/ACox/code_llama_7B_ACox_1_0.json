The first premise states that the flugel was zargled.\n2. The second premise states that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n3. The conclusion is that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nHowever, this conclusion cannot be drawn from the given premises. The first premise does not imply that the flugel was blimmed, and the second premise does not logically follow from the first premise. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel was blimmed\" from these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
