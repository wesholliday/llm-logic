This is a tautology, which means it is always true.\n2. The second premise states that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This is a possibility that is not explicitly ruled out by the first premise.\n3. The conclusion states that the cookies are in the jar. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, but it does not necessarily follow that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
