This means that if Fido is not inside, then it must be in the garden.\n2. The second premise states that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, even if the first premise is true.\n3. The conclusion states that Fido is inside. This means that if the first premise is true and the second premise is false (i.e., Fido might be in the garden), then the conclusion must also be true.\n4. However, the second premise is false, as Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
