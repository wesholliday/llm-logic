This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. This statement is a possibility that is not necessarily true.\n3. The conclusion states that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. This statement is based on the first premise, which implies that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it uses a disjunction to establish a conclusion that follows from the premises. The first premise provides a necessary condition for the conclusion, while the second premise provides an additional possibility that can help to support the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
