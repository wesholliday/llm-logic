Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"The pen might not be on my desk\" is not sufficient to establish the conclusion \"The pen is in my bag.\" If the pen is not on my desk, then it could be anywhere else, including in my bag. Therefore, this argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because it is not sound and not complete.",
