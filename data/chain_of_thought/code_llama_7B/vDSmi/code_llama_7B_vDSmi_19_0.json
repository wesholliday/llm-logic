The first premise states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This premise is a tautology, which means that it is always true regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, this premise does not provide any new information and can be safely ignored.\n2. The second premise states that the watch might not be on his wrist. This premise is also a tautology, as it is always true. However, it does provide some additional information about the situation.\n3. The conclusion states that the watch is charging on the dresser. This conclusion follows logically from the second premise, as if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
