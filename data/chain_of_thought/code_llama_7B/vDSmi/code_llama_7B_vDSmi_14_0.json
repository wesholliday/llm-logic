This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. This is a possibility that is not explicitly ruled out by the first premise.\n3. The conclusion states that the milk is on the counter. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, as it is possible for the milk to be on the counter without being chilling in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
