This is a biconditional, which means that if the book is on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table, and if it is not on the shelf, then it must not be resting on the table.\n2. The second premise states that the book might not be resting on the table. This is a possibility that is not explicitly ruled out by the first premise.\n3. The conclusion states that the book is on the shelf. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, but it does not necessarily follow that the book must be on the shelf. In fact, if the second premise is true, then the book might not be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
