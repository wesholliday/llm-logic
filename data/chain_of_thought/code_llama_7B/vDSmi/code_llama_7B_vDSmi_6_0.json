Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The phone is in the living room\" is based on the second premise \"The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen,\" but we cannot infer this conclusion from the first premise alone. Therefore, this argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is neither sound nor complete, and it is therefore logically invalid.",
