This is a tautology, as the two possibilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Therefore, this premise is valid.\n2. The second premise states that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This premise is also valid, as it allows for the possibility that the notebook is in the drawer or somewhere else entirely.\n3. The conclusion states that the notebook is in the drawer. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, as if the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, then the second premise would be false and the conclusion would also be false. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
