This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This is a possibility that is not explicitly ruled out by the first premise.\n3. The conclusion states that the sunglasses are in her bag. This statement is based on the assumption that the sunglasses must be in her bag, since they cannot be perched on her head if they are not there.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it does not rely on any false assumptions or contradictions. The first premise provides a sufficient condition for the conclusion to hold true, and the second premise does not contradict the first premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
