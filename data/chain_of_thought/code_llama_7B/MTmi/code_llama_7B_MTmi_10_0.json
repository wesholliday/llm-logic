This means that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must also not be outside.\n\nFrom P2, we know that the cat might not have been outside. This means that it is possible that the cat was not outside, even if the dog was not inside.\n\nStep 4: We can now use the premises and the conclusion of the argument to make the inference.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
