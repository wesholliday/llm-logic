The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars. It only means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter.\n\nThe second premise states that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This does not contradict the first premise, as it is possible for the robot to have visited Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given premises.",
