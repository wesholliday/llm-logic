This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris must not have finished the race either. However, we also know that Chris might not have finished the race. Therefore, it is possible that Chris did not finish the race even though Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on these premises alone. We need more information to make a conclusion about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\n### Answer: No",
