This is a logical implication and does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThe second statement simply states that the pants might not have been denim, which does not contradict the first statement. It is possible that the pants were not denim even if the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on these two statements alone.",
