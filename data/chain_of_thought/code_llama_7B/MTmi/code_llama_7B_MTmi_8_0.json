The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire is not awake.\n\nThe statement \"The mummy might not have been awake\" suggests that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state of being. Therefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on this information alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"No\".",
