Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from these two statements.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we need to analyze the first statement and see if it logically implies that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 4: The first statement states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have also gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 5: Now, we need to analyze the second statement and see if it logically contradicts the first statement.\n\nStep 6: The second statement states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park because if he had gone to the park, then Lucy would have also gone to the zoo. However, since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it is possible that Joe did not go to the park either.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, we can conclude that \"Joe did not go to the park\" based on the given statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
