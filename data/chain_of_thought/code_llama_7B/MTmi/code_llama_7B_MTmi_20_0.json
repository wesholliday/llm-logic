(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Determine the validity of each premise.\n\n* Premise 1 is a logical consequence of the given information and is therefore valid.\n* Premise 2 is a possibility that cannot be ruled out, but it does not necessarily follow from the given information. Therefore, it is not necessarily valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion can be logically deduced from the premises.\n\n* The conclusion \"The apple was not red\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises because Premise 2 does not provide sufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the banana was yellow, which would make it impossible to conclude that the apple was not red. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically deducible from the premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
