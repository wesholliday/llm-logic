The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck was actually metal. It could have been made of any material.\n2. The second statement simply states that the truck might not have been metal, but it does not provide any additional information about the material of the truck.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on these two statements alone. We need more information to make a conclusion about the material of the doll.",
