The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" does not logically entail that Sue did not choose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (premise)\n2. Bob might not have chosen pasta (hypothetical assumption)\n3. Therefore, it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza (conclusion)\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. It is possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta, but also possible that Sue did not choose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta. The statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" does not provide any information about whether or not Sue chose pizza.",
