This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis either.\n\nHowever, we are also given the possibility that Amy might not have played tennis. This means that even if Jeff did not play basketball, Amy might still have played tennis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jeff did not play basketball based solely on the premises provided.\n\n### Answer: No",
