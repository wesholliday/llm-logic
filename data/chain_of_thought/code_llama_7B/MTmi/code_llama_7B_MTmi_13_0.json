The truck might not have been blue.\n\nStep 2: We want to infer whether the car was red or not.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. If the first statement is true and the second statement is false, then we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nStep 4: Let's evaluate the truth of each statement:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. (This statement is true.)\n2. The truck might not have been blue. (This statement is false.)\n\nStep 5: Based on the above evaluation, we can conclude that the car was not red. Therefore, our answer is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
