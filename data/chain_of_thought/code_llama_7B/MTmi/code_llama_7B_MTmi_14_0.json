However, this combination does not necessarily imply that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nCombination 2: If the bear was in the cave and the wolf was definitely not in the den, then it is certain that the bear was not in the cave. This combination implies that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nStep 4: Based on the possible combinations of the two premises, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave if the wolf was definitely not in the den. However, we cannot infer this conclusion based solely on the first premise alone.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
