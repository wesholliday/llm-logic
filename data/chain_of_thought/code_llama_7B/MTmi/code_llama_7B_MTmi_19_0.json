Premise 1 is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\" Premise 2 is also a conditional statement of the form \"If not B, then not A,\" where A is \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" and B is \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nStep 5: Now, we need to see if the two conditional statements are consistent with each other. To do this, we need to analyze the conditions of both premises.\n\nStep 6: In Premise 1, if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen would definitely have watched basketball.\n\nStep 7: In Premise 2, Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, even if Tom did watch football.\n\nStep 8: Now, we need to see if the two premises are consistent with each other. To do this, we need to consider the possibility that Tom did not watch football. If Tom did not watch football, then it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball either. In this case, Premise 1 would be false, and Premise 2 would still hold true.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
