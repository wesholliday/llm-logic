This means that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins can still be blueberry or they may not be blueberry at all.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means that even if the cake was chocolate, the muffins could still not have been blueberry.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" because if the cake is not chocolate, then it must be blueberry (if the muffins are blueberry) or it may not be blueberry at all (if the muffins are not blueberry).\n\n### Answer: Yes",
