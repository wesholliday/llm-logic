The second statement does not necessarily contradict this implication, as it only suggests that the book might not meet those criteria. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was not written by James based on these two statements alone.\n\nTo draw a conclusion about the authorship of the book, we would need additional information or evidence.",
