The first statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that if the apple were red, then the banana would also be yellow. This is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that the apple is actually red.\n2. The second statement \"The banana was yellow\" simply states that the banana is indeed yellow, without any additional information about its color.\n3. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the apple was red based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to support this conclusion.",
