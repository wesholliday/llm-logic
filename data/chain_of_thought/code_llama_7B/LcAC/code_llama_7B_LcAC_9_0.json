The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, meaning that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt as well. However, the statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not necessarily imply that Lisa bought the red shirt, as there may be other possible explanations for why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the information provided.",
