The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies a causal relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it does not necessarily mean that Sue's choice was the cause of Bob's choice.\n\nFor example, suppose that Bob chose pasta because he likes Italian food, regardless of what Sue chose. In this case, Bob's choice of pasta would be independent of Sue's choice of pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sue chose pizza based on the information provided.",
