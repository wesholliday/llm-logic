This means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, but it does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was metal. This does not provide any information about the doll's material.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the doll was plastic based on these two premises alone.",
