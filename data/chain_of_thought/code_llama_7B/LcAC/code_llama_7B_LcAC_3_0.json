The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James. It could have been written by someone else who happens to be a mystery writer.\n2. The second premise simply states that the book is a mystery novel. This does not provide any information about who wrote the book.\n3. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"The book was written by James\" from these two premises. We need additional information or evidence to make this conclusion.",
