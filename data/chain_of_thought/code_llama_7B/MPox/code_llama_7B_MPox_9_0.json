The first premise states that a twonk was plinked, but it does not provide any information about whether or not it was varnished. The second premise assumes that if a twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished, but this is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It was varnished\" from the given premises.",
