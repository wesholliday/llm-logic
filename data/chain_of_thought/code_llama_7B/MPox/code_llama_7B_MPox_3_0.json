The first premise states that the splat was morphed, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the splat quanked. The second premise provides a conditional statement that if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked, but this statement is not necessarily true in all cases. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat quanked\" from these two premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
