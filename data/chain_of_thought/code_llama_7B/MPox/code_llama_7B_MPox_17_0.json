The first premise states that the flob was skizzled, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the flob moved. The second premise assumes that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved, but this is a conditional statement that is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob movated\" from \"The flob was skizzled\" and \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"",
