The second premise, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended,\" is an assumption that if the dreb was used for a particular purpose, it must have been spent. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, and it does not follow from the first premise that the dreb was spent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was spended\" from these two premises.",
