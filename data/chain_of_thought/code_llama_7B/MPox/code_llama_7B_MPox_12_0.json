The first premise states that the smip was shripped. This means that the smip has been shrunk or reduced in size.\n2. The second premise states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip is shrunk, it will also lick the zoint.\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether or not the smip has actually been shrunk. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smip has licked the zoint based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip lupped the zoint\" from \"The smip was shripped\" together with \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"",
