The premise \"The fribble was snurgled\" states that the fribble was in some state of being snurgled.\n2. The premise \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" states that if the fribble is in a certain state (snurgled), then it will also be in another state (crinked).\n3. The conclusion \"The fribble crinked\" states that the fribble is in the state of being crinked.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the fribble was snurgled and therefore crinked. It could have been crinked for other reasons, such as it being a natural state or having undergone some other process.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fribble crinked\" from \"The fribble was snurgled\" together with \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"",
