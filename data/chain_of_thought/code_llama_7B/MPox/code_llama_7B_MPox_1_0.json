The first two statements do not logically entail the third statement, so we cannot infer it from them.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"The flugel was blimmed\" - This statement is true.\n2. \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" - This statement is a conditional statement that implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it would also be zargled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flugel was actually zargled.\n3. \"The flugel was zargled\" - This statement is false, as we have not established that the flugel was actually zargled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel was zargled\" from \"The flugel was blimmed\" and \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"",
