The first premise states that \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n2. The second premise states that \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that it only logically follows from the first premise if the condition stated in the antecedent (i.e., \"the sprocket was cranked\") is true.\n3. The conclusion states that \"The sprocket was daggled.\" This conclusion does not follow logically from the first two premises, because the second premise only applies if the condition stated in the antecedent (i.e., \"the sprocket was cranked\") is true.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was daggled\" from \"The sprocket was cranked\" together with \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"",
