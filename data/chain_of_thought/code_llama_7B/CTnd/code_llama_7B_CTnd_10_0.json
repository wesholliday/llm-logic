The statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" does not necessarily mean that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. It only means that if advice was offered and it was not helpful, then it was not offered.\n\nFor example, imagine a situation where someone offers you unsolicited advice on how to improve your job performance. Although the advice may not be helpful, it is still considered as \"advice\" being offered. In this case, the statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" would still hold true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered based on the given statement alone.",
