However, this does not necessarily mean that if you did buy vegetables, then you did not go to the store. There could be other reasons why you bought vegetables without going to the store.\n\nFor example, you may have bought vegetables from a different store or from a grocery delivery service. Or, you may have already had vegetables in your fridge and simply chose to buy them again instead of going to the store.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you bought vegetables, then you did not go to the store based on this single statement.",
