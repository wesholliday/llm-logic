This does not necessarily mean that the customer was not served at all. It could be that the customer was served but not in a timely manner.\n\nFor example, let's say that the customer was served with a meal, but it took 30 minutes for the server to bring the food to the table. In this case, the customer was served promptly (the food arrived within the allotted time), but they were not served promptly in terms of the overall service experience.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served from the given statement alone.",
