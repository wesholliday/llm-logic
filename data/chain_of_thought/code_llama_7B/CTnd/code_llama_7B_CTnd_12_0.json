However, it does not necessarily mean that she did not study at all. It could be that she studied for a short period of time but still managed to learn something.\n\nFor example, let's say Jane studied for 30 minutes and learned a lot. The first statement would still hold true, as she did not study for a long time. However, the second statement would not necessarily be true, as she did study for a short period of time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jane studied long, then she did not study from the given statement alone.",
