This does not necessarily mean that he did not study at all, but rather that he did not study with great effort or dedication.\n\nFor example, Ben may have studied for a few hours each day, but not with the same level of focus and commitment as someone who studies for longer periods of time. In this case, Ben would still be considered to have studied, even if he did not study diligently.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not study from the given statement alone.",
