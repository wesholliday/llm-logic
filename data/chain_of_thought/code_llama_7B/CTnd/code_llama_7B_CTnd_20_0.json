This does not necessarily mean that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. It could be that a strong recommendation was made and it was still not a recommendation.\n\nFor example, let's say that a company makes a strong recommendation to its customers to buy their product. However, the company also provides some additional information about the product, such as its features and benefits, which are not necessarily related to the recommendation itself. In this case, the company has made a strong recommendation, but it is still not a recommendation in the classical sense, as it does not solely rely on the recommendation to make a purchase decision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made based on the given statement alone.",
