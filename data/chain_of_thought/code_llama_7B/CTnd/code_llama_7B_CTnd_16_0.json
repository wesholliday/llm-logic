The given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a relationship between two conditions or propositions. In this case, the first condition is \"if the job was completed,\" and the second condition is \"then it was not completed well.\" This implies that if the job was completed, then it was not completed with good quality or performance.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed based on this statement alone. The statement does not provide enough information to make such an inference. It only provides a counterfactual scenario where the job was completed but not well. To draw such an inference, we would need additional information or context.",
