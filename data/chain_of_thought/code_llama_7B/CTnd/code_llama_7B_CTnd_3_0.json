This means that if you did eat a meal, then you also did not eat a large meal. However, this does not necessarily mean that if you did not eat a meal, then you also did not eat a large meal.\n\nFor example, let's say you ate a small meal. Then, according to the first statement, you did not eat a large meal. But this does not necessarily mean that you did not eat any meal at all. You could have eaten a small meal and then also eaten a large meal later on.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you did not eat a meal, then you also did not eat a large meal from the given statement.",
