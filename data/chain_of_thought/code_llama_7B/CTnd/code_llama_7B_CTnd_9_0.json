The two statements are contradictory and cannot be logically deduced from each other.\n\nThe first statement implies that if instructions were given, they were not explained clearly, which means that the instructions were not provided in a clear or understandable manner. This does not necessarily mean that the instructions were not given at all.\n\nOn the other hand, the second statement suggests that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given. This implies that if the instructions were explained clearly, it would mean that they were not necessary to be given in the first place. However, this is a false assumption, as clear instructions can still be necessary even if they are already known or understood.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer one statement from the other and must consider both statements separately.",
