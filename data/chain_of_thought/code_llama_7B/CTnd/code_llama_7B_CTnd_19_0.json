The two statements are contradictory and cannot be logically deduced from each other.\n\nThe first statement implies that if directions were provided, they were not explained clearly. This means that the directions were provided but were not clear or easy to understand.\n\nThe second statement implies that if directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided. This means that the directions were not provided in the first place, and therefore, it is impossible for them to have been explained clearly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer one statement from the other.",
