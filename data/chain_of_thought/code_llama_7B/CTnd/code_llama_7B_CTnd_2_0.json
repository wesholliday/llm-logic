This means that if Ann does not exercise at all, or only exercises lightly, then she did not exercise strenuously. However, it does not necessarily mean that she did not exercise at all.\n\nFor example, if Ann only exercises for a short period of time each day, but still manages to get some physical activity in, then she may have exercised strenuously without realizing it. In this case, the premise would be true, but the conclusion would not necessarily hold.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Ann exercises strenuously, then she did not exercise from the given premise alone.",
