The statement \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\" implies that the issue was indeed addressed, but the addressing was not effective in achieving the desired outcome. It does not necessarily mean that the issue was not addressed at all.\n\nFor example, if a doctor prescribes medication for a patient's condition, but the medication has no effect, it does not necessarily mean that the doctor did not address the issue effectively. The issue may have been addressed, but the solution may not have been effective in achieving the desired outcome.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\" Instead, we can only conclude that the issue was addressed, but the addressing was not effective in achieving the desired outcome.",
