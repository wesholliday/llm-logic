The given statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly. However, this does not imply that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\n\nFor example, let's say we have two sets of clothes: one set is clean and well-maintained, and the other set is dirty and in need of laundry. If we assume that the first set of clothes was washed properly, then it does not necessarily follow that the second set of clothes was not washed. In fact, it's possible that both sets of clothes were washed, but one set was washed properly while the other set was not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.",
