The first statement implies that Alex did not exercise much, but it does not necessarily mean that he did not exercise at all. It could be that Alex only exercised a little bit or that he did not exercise for some other reason.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\nSuppose Alex is a busy person who works long hours and has no time to exercise. If we say \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much,\" it would be true because Alex did not exercise much (he didn't exercise at all). However, if we say \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise,\" it would also be true because Alex did not exercise much (he didn't exercise at all).\n\nSo, while the first statement implies that Alex did not exercise much, the second statement does not necessarily imply that he did not exercise at all.",
