The first statement implies that the issue was not discussed in depth, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not discussed at all. It could have been discussed briefly or superficially, without going into much detail.\n\nFor example, if someone asked a question and you provided a brief answer, that would not necessarily mean that you did not discuss the issue in depth. You may have given a general overview of the topic, but you may not have gone into as much detail as you could have.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that from the first statement alone. We need more information or context to make an accurate inference.",
