The first premise, \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf,\" states that the toy is not in its usual location, which is on the shelf.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf,\" implies that the toy could be either in the toy box or on the shelf.\n3. Since we know that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, it must be in the toy box. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The toy is in the toy box\" from \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" together with \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\"",
