This is because the second statement provides an alternative explanation for the presence of the book, and the first statement asserts that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The book is on the shelf' from 'The book isn't resting on the table' together with 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table'?\" is yes.",
