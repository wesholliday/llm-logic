The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" implies that the notebook is either in a different location or it is not present at all. The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" does not provide any additional information about the location of the notebook, and therefore cannot be used to infer its location.\n\n### Answer: No",
