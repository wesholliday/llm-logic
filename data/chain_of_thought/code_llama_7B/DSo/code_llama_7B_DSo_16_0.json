This means that if the pen were to be on my desk, then the statement would be false.\n\nStep 3: The second statement says that either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk. This means that if the pen were to be in my bag, then the statement would be true.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the pen is not on my desk based on the first statement. Therefore, if the pen were to be in my bag, then the second statement would also be true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can conclude that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
