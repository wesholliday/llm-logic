The statement \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" implies that the remote control is not located under the couch, which means it could be anywhere else in the room. Additionally, the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" suggests that there are two possible locations for the remote control, but it does not provide any information about its actual location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
