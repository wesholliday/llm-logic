If the premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is true, then we can conclude that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that the statement \"The cat was outside\" implies that the dog was inside.\n2. However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of \"The cat was outside\" (i.e., \"The dog was inside\") is true. It's possible that the cat was outside and the dog was inside, even if the premise is true.\n3. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The dog was inside\" is true based on the given information. The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement, and it only implies that the cat was outside if the dog was inside. It does not necessarily imply that the dog was inside.\n\n### Answer: No",
