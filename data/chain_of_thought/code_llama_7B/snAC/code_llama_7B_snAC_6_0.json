The statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta as well. However, this does not guarantee that Sue actually chose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose something else instead of pizza, and Bob chose pasta in response to that choice.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Suppose 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is true. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta as well.\n2. Now suppose 'Bob chose pasta' is true. This means that Bob actually chose pasta.\n3. From step 1 and 2, we can conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose something else instead of pizza, and Bob chose pasta in response to that choice.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'Sue chose pizza' is true.",
