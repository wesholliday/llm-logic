In this case, both premises are true, so the conclusion follows logically from the premises and the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is true or false\n\nThe argument is true because it is a valid argument that leads to a logical conclusion. Therefore, \"The cake was chocolate\" is true.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
