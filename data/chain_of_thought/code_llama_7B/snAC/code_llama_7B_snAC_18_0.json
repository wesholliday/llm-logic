If the doll was plastic and the truck was metal, then we can conclude that the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true.\n2. However, this does not necessarily mean that the original statement \"The doll was plastic\" is true. It could be false, even if the other two statements are true.\n3. For example, suppose the doll was made of a different material altogether (e.g., wood or glass), and the truck was metal. In this case, the first two statements would still be true, but the third statement \"The doll was plastic\" would be false.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is true based on the fact that the other two statements are true. We need to have additional information or evidence to support this conclusion.",
