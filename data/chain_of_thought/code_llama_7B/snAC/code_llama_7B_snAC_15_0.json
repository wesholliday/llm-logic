The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, this does not mean that Sam necessarily took a plane. It could be that Sam took a different mode of transportation or did not take any trip at all.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (premise)\n2. Erin took a train (hypothetical assumption)\n3. Therefore, if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (modus ponens)\n4. However, it does not necessarily follow that Sam took a plane (conclusion)",
