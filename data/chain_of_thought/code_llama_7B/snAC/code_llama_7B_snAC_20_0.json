This means that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow.\n2. The premise \"The banana was yellow\" is also true. This means that the banana actually was yellow.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not necessarily red. It could have been any color, including green or blue.\n\nSo, while it is true that the banana was yellow, it does not follow that the apple was red.",
