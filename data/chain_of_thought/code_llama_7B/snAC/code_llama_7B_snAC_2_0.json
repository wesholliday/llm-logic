In this case, both premises are true (the griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was in the forest), so the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is sound\n\nThe argument is sound because it uses a valid conditional statement and the premises are both true. Therefore, the conclusion is also true.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
