This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Now suppose 'Chris finished the race is true'. This means that Chris finished the race.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race. It could be that Alex did not finish the race but Chris did.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'Alex finished the race' is true.",
