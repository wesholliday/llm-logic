The first sentence suggests that the dreb must be spent in order to be vroombed, but it does not provide any information about whether the dreb is actually spent.\n2. The second sentence suggests that the dreb might not be spent, which means that it could still be vroombed even if it is not spent.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from these two sentences alone. We need additional information to determine whether the dreb is actually vroombed or not.",
