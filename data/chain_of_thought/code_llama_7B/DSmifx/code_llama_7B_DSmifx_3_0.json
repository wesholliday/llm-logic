The first statement implies that the splat must be quanked, which means it cannot be morphed.\n2. The second statement suggests that the splat might not be quanked, but this does not necessarily mean that it is morphed. It could still be a splat that is not quanked.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed based on these two statements alone. We need more information or context to make an accurate inference.",
