The first statement suggests that either the sneg must be sproted or it is cramped, while the second statement suggests that the sneg might not be sproted. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the sneg is cramped.\n\nFor example, if the sneg is not sproted, then it is not cramped either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sneg is cramped based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
