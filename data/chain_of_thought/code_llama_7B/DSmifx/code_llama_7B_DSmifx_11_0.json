The first premise states that either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed. This means that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n2. The second premise states that the flug might not be zimmed. This means that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed, even though it must be blummed according to the first premise.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flug is blummed\" from these two premises. The second premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the flug is blummed.",
