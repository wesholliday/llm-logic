The first statement suggests that either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered, while the second statement states that the fleeg might not be surned. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nFor example, if the fleeg is not surned, then it is not bluttered either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
