The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first premise:\n\nIf the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nThis means that if the alien did visit Mars, then it is necessary for the robot to have visited Jupiter as well. This implies that the robot did visit Jupiter if the alien did visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second premise:\n\nThe robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nThis means that the robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter. It is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter even if the alien did visit Mars.\n\nSo, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars if the robot did not visit Jupiter. This is because if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars either.\n\n### Answer:\n\nYes",
