However, we cannot be certain that the truck is definitely metal, as there may be other materials that could also be used to make a truck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based solely on the information given in the problem. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the material of the doll.\n\n### Answer: No",
