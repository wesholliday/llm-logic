The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first premise:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nThis means that if the griffin is present in a certain location (forest), then it logically follows that the unicorn is also present in that same location (forest). This is because the griffin and the unicorn are both animals that live in forests, so they must be found together in those locations.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second premise:\n\nThe unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nThis means that it is possible that the unicorn was not present in the forest, even if the griffin was. This possibility is introduced to avoid a logical contradiction, as it would be absurd for both the griffin and the unicorn to be in the forest at the same time if they are both animals that live in forests.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\nCan we infer that the griffin was not in the forest?\n\nYes, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the first premise and the second premise. If the unicorn might not have been in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin was not present in the forest either. This is because if the unicorn was not in the forest, then it is also possible that the griffin was not in the forest, as they are both animals that live in forests.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
