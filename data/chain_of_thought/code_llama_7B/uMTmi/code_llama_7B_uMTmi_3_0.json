In this case, we can infer that the book is either a mystery novel or it is not a mystery novel. If the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the book was not written by James, then it is either a mystery novel or it is not a mystery novel. This means that we cannot infer anything about the authorship of the book based on the fact that it is not a mystery novel.\n\n### Answer: No",
