The banana might not have been yellow.\n3. Can we infer that the apple was not red?\n\nNow, let's consider each of these statements in turn and see if we can draw any conclusions:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This statement is a logical implication, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true and the consequent (the banana being yellow) is also true.\n2. The banana might not have been yellow. This statement is a possibility, but it does not contradict the previous statement. It simply means that there are other possibilities besides the banana being yellow.\n3. Can we infer that the apple was not red? This statement asks whether we can draw a conclusion from the given information. The answer is yes, we can infer that the apple was not red based on the first two statements. If the apple was red and the banana might not have been yellow, then it is possible that the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is yes, we can infer that the apple was not red based on the given information.",
