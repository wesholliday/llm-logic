This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. Erin might not have taken a train. This means that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, even if Sam did not take a plane.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information. We can only conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but we cannot say for certain whether or not Sam took a plane.\n\n### Answer: No",
