Can we infer that the car was not red?\n\nNow, let's consider each of these statements in turn and see if we can draw any conclusions:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This statement is a logical implication, which means that it is true only if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"the car was red\" and the consequent is \"the truck must have been blue.\" If we assume that the car was indeed red, then it follows logically that the truck must have been blue.\n2. The truck might not have been blue. This statement is a possibility, but it does not contradict the first statement. It simply means that there is no guarantee that the truck was blue.\n3. Can we infer that the car was not red? Based on the first two statements, we can conclude that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, we cannot infer that the car was not red based solely on these two statements. The third statement is a possibility, but it does not provide any additional information about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer that the car was not red?\" is no. We cannot draw any conclusions about the color of the car based solely on the first two statements.",
