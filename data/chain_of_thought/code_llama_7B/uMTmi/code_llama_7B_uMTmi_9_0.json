This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, we can conclude that Mark also bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This statement does not contradict our previous conclusion, but it adds an additional possibility: Mark might not have bought the blue shirt even if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n3. Can we infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt? Yes, we can infer this because if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then he must have bought the red shirt (since Mark must have bought the blue shirt if Lisa bought the red shirt). Therefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
