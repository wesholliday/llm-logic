In this case, both the vampire and the mummy are aware of each other's presence.\n2. The vampire is awake but the mummy is not. In this case, the vampire is aware of its own presence but not aware of the mummy's absence.\n3. The vampire is not awake and the mummy is also not. In this case, neither the vampire nor the mummy are aware of each other's presence.\n\nFrom these possible scenarios, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well. However, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on the fact that the mummy might not have been awake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\n### Answer: No",
