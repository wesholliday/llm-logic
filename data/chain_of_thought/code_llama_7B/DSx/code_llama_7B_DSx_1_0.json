This means that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the flugel is not zargled. This contradicts with the first statement, as we have just established that the flugel must be blimmed if it is not zargled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
