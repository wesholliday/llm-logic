The first premise, \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned,\" states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned.\n2. The second premise, \"The fleeg is not surned,\" states that the fleeg is not surned. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must not be surned.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises. The first premise states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned, but it does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered. Similarly, the second premise states that the fleeg is not surned, but it does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned\" and \"The fleeg is not surned.\"",
