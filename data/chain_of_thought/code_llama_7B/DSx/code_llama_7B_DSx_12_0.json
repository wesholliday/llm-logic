The first statement, \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped,\" is a logical contradiction. It implies that the smip can be both shripped and lupped at the same time, which is impossible.\n2. The second statement, \"The smip is not lupped,\" states that the smip is not lupped, but we already know from the first statement that it cannot be lupped because it is either shripped or lupped. Therefore, this statement is redundant and does not provide any new information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip is shripped\" from these two statements.",
