This means that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the flob is not movated.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can infer that the flob is skizzled. This is because if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled by the first statement.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
