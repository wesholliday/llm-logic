The first premise, \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged,\" states that the glip can be either slogged or tragged.\n2. The second premise, \"The glip is not tragged,\" states that the glip is not tragged.\n3. The conclusion, \"The glip is slogged,\" states that the glip is slogged.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises. If the glip is not tragged, then it cannot be slogged. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The glip is slogged\" from these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"No.\"",
