This can be written as \"If A, then B\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the wug is not bimmed.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the wug is flooped because of the first statement and the fact that the wug is not bimmed. This can be written as \"If A, then B\" and \"not B\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is flooped based on the given statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
