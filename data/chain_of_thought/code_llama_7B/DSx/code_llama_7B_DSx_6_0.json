The sentence \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" means that either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped, but not both.\n2. The sentence \"The grommet is not plopped\" means that the grommet is not plopped, which contradicts with the first sentence.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed based on the given information.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
