In this case, if the apple was red and the banana was yellow, then it logically follows that the apple was red. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is true or false\n\nThe argument is true because it is a logical consequence of the premises. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and therefore the argument is true.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
