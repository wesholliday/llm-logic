In this case, if the muffins were blueberry and the cake was chocolate, then the conclusion follows logically. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is sound\n\nThe argument is sound because it uses a logical consequence and the premises are both true. Therefore, the argument is sound.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
