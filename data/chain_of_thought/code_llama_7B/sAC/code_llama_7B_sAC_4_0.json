The premises are both true, and the conclusion logically follows from them. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is sound or unsound\n\nThe argument is sound because it uses a valid conditional statement and the premises are both true. Therefore, the argument is sound.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
