This means that if the alien did visit Mars, it is likely that the robot also visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 4: Since we know that the robot visited Jupiter, and the first statement implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, it is likely that the alien also visited Mars.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can logically deduce that \"The alien visited Mars\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
