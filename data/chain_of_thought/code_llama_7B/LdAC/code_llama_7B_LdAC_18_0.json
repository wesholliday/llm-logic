This implies that the truck being metal does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it simply states that the truck was metal without any conditions or implications.\n\nStep 4: Based on the two statements given, we cannot logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" because the first statement implies that the doll being plastic does not necessarily mean that the truck was metal, and the second statement simply states that the truck was metal without any conditions or implications.\n\n### Answer: No",
