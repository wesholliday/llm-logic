However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue actually chose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose something else or that she did not make a choice at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Sue chose pizza based on the premises \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta.\"",
