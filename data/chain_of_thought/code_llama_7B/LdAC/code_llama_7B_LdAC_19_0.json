This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nStep 3: We are also given the fact that Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball, and since she watched basketball, it follows that she did not watch football.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements.",
