This means that if Ben ate pasta, then there must be some reason why Kate ate salad.\n\nStep 5: The second premise simply states that Kate ate salad. This does not provide any information about whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Ben ate pasta\" from these two premises alone. We need additional information to make this conclusion.\n\n### Answer: No",
