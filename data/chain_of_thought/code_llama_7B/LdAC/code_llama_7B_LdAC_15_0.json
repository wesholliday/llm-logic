            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Erin took a train\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is an implication, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If Sam took a plane,\" and the consequent is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nStep 3: The second statement is simply a fact that Erin took a train.\n\nStep 4: We can combine these two statements by using logical deduction to arrive at a new conclusion. If the antecedent of the implication is true, and the consequent is also true, then we can logically deduce that the entire implication must be true. In this case, if \"If Sam took a plane\" is true (i.e., Sam did take a plane), then it follows that Erin took a train (since the implication is true).\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can logically deduce that \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
