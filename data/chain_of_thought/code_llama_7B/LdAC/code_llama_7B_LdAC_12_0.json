This means that if a certain condition is met (i.e., Joe went to the park), then a different condition must also be met (i.e., Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nStep 3: We are given the second statement, \"Lucy went to the zoo\". This statement does not provide any information about whether or not Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that Joe went to the park based on the two statements provided. The first statement only provides a condition for Lucy going to the zoo, and the second statement does not provide any information about Joe's actions.",
