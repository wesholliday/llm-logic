            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it has a condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) and an implication (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it does not have any conditions.\n\nStep 4: We want to determine whether we can logically deduce \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the two statements given.\n\nStep 5: To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa bought the red shirt. However, the second statement simply states that Mark bought the blue shirt without any conditions.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the two statements given. The first statement implies a condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) and an implication (Mark buying the blue shirt), while the second statement is an unconditional statement that does not provide any information about Lisa's purchase.\n\n### Answer: No",
