The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy will also be awake. However, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire is awake.\n2. The second premise states that the mummy was awake. This means that the mummy is awake, regardless of whether the vampire is awake or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"The vampire was awake\" from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The mummy was awake.\" We can only conclude that the mummy was awake based on the given information.\n\n### Answer: No",
