            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies that if the premise (in this case, \"the car was red\") is true, then the conclusion (in this case, \"the truck was blue\") must also be true.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it simply states a fact without any conditions or implications.\n\nStep 4: We can logically deduce \"The car was red\" from the first statement alone, but we cannot logically deduce \"The car was red\" from the second statement alone.\n\nReasoning: The first statement implies that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, the second statement simply states that the truck was blue without any conditions or implications. Therefore, we can logically deduce \"The car was red\" from the first statement alone, but not from the second statement alone.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
