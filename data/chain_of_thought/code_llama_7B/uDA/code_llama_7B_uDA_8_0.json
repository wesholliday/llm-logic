The statement \"the vampire was not awake\" does not necessarily mean that the mummy was also not awake. It is possible that the vampire and mummy were both asleep or that there was some other reason why the vampire was not awake while the mummy was.\n\nTo determine whether the mummy was awake or not, we would need more information. For example, if we knew that the vampire had been sleeping for a long time and the mummy had been awake for a shorter period of time, it might be inferred that the mummy was still awake. However, without additional information, we cannot make any conclusions about the mummy's state of being.\n\n### Answer: No",
