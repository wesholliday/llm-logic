The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest (by the first statement). However, since the griffin was not in the forest, it follows that the unicorn was not in the forest either.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
