The cake was not chocolate. (This is a factual statement.)\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the muffins were blueberry:\n\n* If the cake was chocolate and the muffins were blueberry, then the muffins would have been blueberry even if the cake was not chocolate. (This is a logical consequence of the conditional statement.)\n* However, we know that the cake was not chocolate, so it is unlikely that the muffins were blueberry. (This is a factual statement based on our initial knowledge.)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry if the cake was not chocolate.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
