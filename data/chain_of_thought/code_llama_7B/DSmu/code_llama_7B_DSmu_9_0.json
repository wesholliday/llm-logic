The first premise states that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. The second premise states that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nIf we assume that the missing puzzle piece is in the box, then the first premise is satisfied because the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box. However, if we assume that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then the second premise is satisfied because it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor (i.e., it could be anywhere).\n\nTherefore, based on these two premises, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.",
