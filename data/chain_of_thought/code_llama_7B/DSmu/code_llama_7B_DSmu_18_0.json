The first premise states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that there are two possible scenarios: either the notebook is in the drawer, or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that we cannot assume that the notebook is necessarily sitting on the nightstand.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The notebook is in the drawer\" from these two premises. The notebook could be in either the drawer or on the nightstand, depending on the specific circumstances.",
