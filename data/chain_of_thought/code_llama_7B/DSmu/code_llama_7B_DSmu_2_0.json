The first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This means that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book cannot be resting on the table, regardless of whether it's on the shelf or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be somewhere else (e.g., in a drawer or on a chair). This means that we cannot infer \"The book is on the shelf\" from the given premises.",
