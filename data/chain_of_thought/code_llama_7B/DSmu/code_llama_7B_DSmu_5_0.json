The first premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n3. However, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar from these two premises alone. The first premise only rules out the possibility that the cookies are hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar. Similarly, the second premise only rules out the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, but it does not necessarily mean that they are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar\" from \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" together with \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"",
