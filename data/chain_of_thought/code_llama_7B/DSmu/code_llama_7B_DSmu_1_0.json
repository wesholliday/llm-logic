We need to use these two statements to infer whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement. It says either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. This means that if Fido is inside, then it is true that Fido is inside. If Fido is not inside, then it is also true that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. It says it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that if Fido must be in the garden, then it is false that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nSo, we can infer that if Fido is inside, then it is true that Fido is inside and it is also false that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is not inside.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
