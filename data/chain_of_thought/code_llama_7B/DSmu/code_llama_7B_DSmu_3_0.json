This means that if the keys are not in the drawer, then they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n* The second premise states that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This means that if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they can be in the drawer or somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" from these two premises. The keys could be in the drawer, but we don't know for sure because we have no evidence that they must be there.",
