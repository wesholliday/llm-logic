The first premise states that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that there may be a situation where the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, even if it's not in the toy box.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The toy is in the toy box\" from these two premises. The toy could be sitting on the bookshelf, but not necessarily in the toy box.",
