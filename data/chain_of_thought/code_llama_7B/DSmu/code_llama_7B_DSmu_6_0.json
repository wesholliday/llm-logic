The first premise states that either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that there may be other possibilities for where the phone could be.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The phone is in the living room\" from these two premises. We need more information to make this inference.",
