The first premise states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch, while the second premise states that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nFor example, suppose the remote control is actually hidden under the couch, and the first premise is true (i.e., either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch). In this case, the second premise would not be true (since it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch), but we would still have to conclude that the remote control is hidden under the couch.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table from these two premises alone. We need additional information or a different set of premises to make this inference.",
