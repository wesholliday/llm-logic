The first premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. This means that if the milk is not on the counter, then it must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge, even if it's not on the counter.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is not on the counter, which means that it must be chilling in the fridge. This contradicts the first premise, so our conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The milk is on the counter\" from \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" together with \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"",
