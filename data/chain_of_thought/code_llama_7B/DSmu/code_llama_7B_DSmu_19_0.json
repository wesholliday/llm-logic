Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the watch is charging on the dresser. (Conclusion)\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not follow logically from the given premises. The first premise states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist, but it does not provide any information about whether the watch is actually charging on the dresser. The second premise states that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist, which means that the watch may be charging on the dresser even if it's not actually on his wrist. Therefore, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on these two premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
