In this case, the consequent (the result) is also false, so the entire statement is false.\n\nHere's how we can reason through this:\n\n1. If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\n2. The wug was sproonged.\n3. Therefore, it was garpled (this is a contradiction, so the statement is false).\n\nSo, we cannot infer \"It was garpled\" from \"If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was sproonged.\"",
