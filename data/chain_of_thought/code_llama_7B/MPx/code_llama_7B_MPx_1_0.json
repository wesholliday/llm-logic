In this case, the first premise entails the second premise, so the conclusion follows logically.\n\nStep 3: Explain your reasoning in detail.\nThe argument is valid because it uses a logical consequence rule to infer the conclusion from the premises. The first premise states that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. This means that if the flugel was blimmed, there must be some connection between being blimmed and being zargled. The second premise states that the flugel was blimmed. This means that the flugel was indeed blimmed, which implies that it must also be zargled. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from both premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
