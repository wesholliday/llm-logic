The fact that the splat was morphed does not necessarily mean that it will quank.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked. (This is the premise.)\n2. The splat was morphed. (This is the assumption.)\n3. Therefore, the splat quanked. (This is the conclusion.)\n\nHowever, this reasoning does not hold water because there are many possible scenarios where the splat could have been morphed but still not quanked. For example, the splat could have been morphed into a different shape or form that does not allow it to quank. In such cases, the conclusion \"The splat quanked\" would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat quanked\" from \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" and \"The splat was morphed.\"",
