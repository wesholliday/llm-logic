The statement \"The sneg sproted the frink\" does not necessarily follow from this, as it is possible for a cramped sneg to still move or stretch.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg sproted the frink\" from \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg was crampled.\"",
