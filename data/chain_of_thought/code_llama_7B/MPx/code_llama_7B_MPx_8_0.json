The first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n2. The second premise states that the sprocket was cranked.\n3. However, we cannot infer from these two premises that the sprocket was daggled. This is because the conditional statement in the first premise only applies if the sprocket was cranked, but it does not necessarily follow that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The sprocket was daggled\" based on these two premises alone. The conclusion must be drawn from additional information or reasoning.",
