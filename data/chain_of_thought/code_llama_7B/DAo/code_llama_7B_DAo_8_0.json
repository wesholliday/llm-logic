The statement \"The vampire was not awake\" does not necessarily mean that the mummy was also not awake. It is possible that the vampire was not awake but the mummy was still awake.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"The vampire was not awake\" means that the vampire was in a state of sleep or unconsciousness.\n2. If the vampire is not awake, then it is possible that the mummy is also not awake.\n3. However, there is no information given to suggest that the mummy was not awake.\n4.
