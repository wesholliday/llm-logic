The statement \"The shirt was not cotton\" does not provide any information about the type of fabric used in the pants. It only provides information about the type of fabric used in the shirt.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. We are given that \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This means that the shirt was made of a different type of fabric than cotton.\n2. We are also given that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This statement is a conditional statement that implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. However, it does not provide any information about the type of fabric used in the pants.\n3. Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim. We only know that the shirt was not cotton and that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. However, we do not know what type of fabric was used in the pants.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim based on the information provided.",
