If Tom watched football, it would mean that he also watched basketball.\n\nStep 3: We are asked to infer whether \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This means that we need to determine whether the opposite of watching basketball is true for Jen.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football. Therefore, it is possible that Jen watched basketball. However, this does not necessarily mean that she did not watch basketball. There could be other factors at play that we are not aware of.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'Jen did not watch basketball'?\" is no. We cannot make a definitive statement about Jen's watching habits based on the information provided.",
