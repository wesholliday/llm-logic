This means that she did not purchase the item in question.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This implies that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (i.e., she did not purchase it), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt either.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is equivalent to saying that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
