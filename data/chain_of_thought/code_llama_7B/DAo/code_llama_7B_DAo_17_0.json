The second premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. Based on these two premises, we can infer that Kate did not eat salad because if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have also eaten salad (since the second premise implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad). Therefore, we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
