The statement \"Sue did not choose pizza\" does not necessarily mean that Bob did not choose pasta. It is possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, or that neither of them chose either option.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. We are given the information \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This means that Sue did not select pizza as her choice.\n2. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob will also choose pasta.\n3. We are asked to infer whether it is true that Bob did not choose pasta based on the given information. However, we cannot make this inference without more information.\n4. Therefore, the answer is \"no,\" we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta based solely on the given information.",
