The statement \"The book was not written by James\" does not necessarily imply that the book is not a mystery novel. It only means that James did not write the book.\n\nTo infer that the book is not a mystery novel, we would need additional information such as the genre of the book or the content of the book. For example, if the book was written by James and it is a romance novel, then we can infer that it is not a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"No\".",
