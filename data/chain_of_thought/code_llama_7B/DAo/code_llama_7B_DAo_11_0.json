This means that it is possible that the cake was chocolate, but we cannot infer that it was not chocolate based on this statement alone.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. However, we do not know whether the cake was chocolate or not.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry based on these two statements alone. We need more information to make a conclusion about this matter.\n\n### Answer: No",
