In this case, the condition is that the cake is chocolate, and the outcome is that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it implies a certain outcome if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the cake is not chocolate, and the outcome is that the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the premise and conclusion logically entail each other.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion logically entail each other, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, we can do so by using a truth table.\n\nTruth Table:\n\n| Cake | Muffins |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chocolate | Blueberry |\n| Not Chocolate | Not Blueberry |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. However, if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are not blueberry. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" logically follows from the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTherefore, the premise and conclusion logically entail each other.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
