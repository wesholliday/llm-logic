The fact that Lucy went to the zoo does not necessarily imply that she did so because Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Explain your reasoning.\nBased on the given statement, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, and it is not necessarily related to whether or not Joe went to the park.\n\n### Answer: No",
