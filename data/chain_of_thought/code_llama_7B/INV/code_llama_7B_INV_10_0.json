It does not necessarily mean that the dog was not inside or that the cat was not outside.\n\nFor example, suppose the dog and cat were both outside when the statement was made. Then, the first statement would be true, but the second statement would not be true. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.\n\n### Answer: No",
