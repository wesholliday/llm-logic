If Alex finished the race, it means that they both finished the race. Therefore, if Alex did not finish the race, it is likely that Chris did not finish the race as well. However, there could be other factors that caused Alex to not finish the race, such as an injury or a mechanical issue, which may not have affected Chris's performance.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
