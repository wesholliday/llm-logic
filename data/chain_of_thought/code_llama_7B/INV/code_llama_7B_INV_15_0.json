They are two different types of statements, and they cannot be directly compared or inferred from each other.\n\nFor example, if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane. There could be other factors that led to Erin taking a train instead of a plane. Similarly, if Sam did not take a plane, there could be other reasons why he did not take a plane, and it is not necessarily related to Erin taking a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.",
