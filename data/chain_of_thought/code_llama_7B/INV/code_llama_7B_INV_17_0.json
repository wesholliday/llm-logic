In this case, the condition is \"Ben ate pasta.\" If Ben did not eat pasta, then the first statement would be false, and we could not infer anything about Kate's eating habits.\n\nHowever, if we know that Ben did not eat pasta, then we can infer that Kate did not eat salad because the two statements are negations of each other. If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad, and vice versa.",
