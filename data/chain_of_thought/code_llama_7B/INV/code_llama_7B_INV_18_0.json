The first statement is a conditional statement, and it does not logically follow that the second statement is also true.\n\nFor example, if the doll was made of plastic, then it is possible that the truck was made of metal, but it is also possible that the truck was made of something else entirely. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was metal based solely on the fact that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'no'.",
