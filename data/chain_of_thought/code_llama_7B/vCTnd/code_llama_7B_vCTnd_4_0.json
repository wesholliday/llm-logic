If Ben studied, then it is impossible for him to have studied diligently, since studying and studying diligently are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, if the premise 1 is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHowever, this argument is a tautology, which means that it is always true regardless of the truth values of its premises. This is because the premises are incompatible with each other, and therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Therefore, the argument is both logically valid and a tautology.",
