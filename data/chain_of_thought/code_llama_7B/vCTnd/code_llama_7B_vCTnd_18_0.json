However, this statement does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support its conclusion. It simply states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth without offering any explanation or justification for this claim.\n\nPremise 2: If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement that asserts that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. However, this statement is logically contradictory to Premise 1, which states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid because it contains a logical contradiction.\n\nConclusion: If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\n\n* This conclusion is based on the premises of the argument and states that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. However, this conclusion is logically contradictory to Premise 1, which states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid because it contains a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
