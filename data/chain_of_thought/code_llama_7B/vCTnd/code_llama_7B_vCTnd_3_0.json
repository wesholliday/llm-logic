The first premise states that if you ate a meal, then you did not eat a large meal. This means that if you did eat a meal, then you did not eat a large meal. On the other hand, the second premise states that if you ate a large meal, then you did not eat a meal. This means that if you did eat a large meal, then you did not eat a meal.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is also logically valid because it follows from the premises. If you ate a meal, then you did not eat a large meal, and if you ate a large meal, then you did not eat a meal. Therefore, if you ate a meal, then you did not eat a large meal.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it has mutually exclusive premises and a logical conclusion.",
