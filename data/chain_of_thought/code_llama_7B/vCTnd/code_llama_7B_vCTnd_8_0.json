The first premise states that if the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively. This means that if the issue was addressed, then there must be some aspect of its addressing that was not effective. The second premise states that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This means that if the issue was addressed effectively, then there must be some aspect of its addressing that was not effective.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is a restatement of the first premise, which implies that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows from the premises to a logical conclusion.",
