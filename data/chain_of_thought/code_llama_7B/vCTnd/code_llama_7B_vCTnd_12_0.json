The first premise states that if Jane studied, then she did not study long. This means that if Jane did study, then she did not study for a long time.\n\nThe second premise states that if Jane studied long, then she did not study. This means that if Jane studied for a long time, then she did not study at all.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is simply a restatement of the first premise. It does not add any new information or make any contradictory statements. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
