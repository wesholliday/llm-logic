However, this does not necessarily mean that the directions were not provided. For example, someone might provide directions without explaining them clearly, or they might provide directions and explain them clearly at a later time.\n\nPremise 2: If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement that asserts that if something (in this case, directions) was explained clearly, then it must have been accompanied by something else (the directions themselves). However, this does not necessarily mean that the directions were not provided. For example, someone might provide directions and explain them clearly without providing the actual directions themselves.\n\nConclusion: If directions were not provided, then they were explained clearly.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement that asserts that if something (in this case, directions) was not provided, then it must have been accompanied by something else (explaining the directions clearly). However, this does not necessarily mean that the directions were not provided. For example, someone might provide directions and explain them clearly without providing the actual directions themselves.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it assumes that if directions were provided, then they must have been accompanied by explanations for those directions. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as there may be cases where directions are provided without any accompanying explanations.",
