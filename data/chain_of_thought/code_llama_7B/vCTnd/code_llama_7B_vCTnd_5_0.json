The first premise states that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This means that if the room was cleaned, then there must be some condition or circumstance that prevents it from being cleaned thoroughly.\n\nThe second premise states that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. This means that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then there must be some condition or circumstance that prevents it from being cleaned again.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is simply a restatement of the first premise. If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This conclusion follows logically from the premises because if the room was cleaned, then there must be some condition or circumstance that prevents it from being cleaned thoroughly.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a straightforward and logical pattern from its premises to its conclusion.",
