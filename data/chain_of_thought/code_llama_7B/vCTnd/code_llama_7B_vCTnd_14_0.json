It is a valid argument because it is based on a correct assumption and it is possible to determine whether the meal was prepared carefully or not.\n\nPremise 2: If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement that asserts that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. However, this premise is logically contradictory to Premise 1 because it implies that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared at all. This means that the conclusion of the argument cannot be drawn, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because its premises are contradictory and cannot be reconciled with each other.",
