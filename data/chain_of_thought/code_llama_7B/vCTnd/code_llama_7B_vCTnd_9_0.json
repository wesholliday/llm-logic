It is not necessarily true that instructions were given, so it is possible for the conclusion to be false even if this premise is true.\n\nPremise 2: If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement that asserts that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given. It is not necessarily true that instructions were explained clearly, so it is possible for the conclusion to be false even if this premise is true.\n\nConclusion: If instructions were not given, then they were explained clearly.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement that asserts that if instructions were not given, then they were explained clearly. It is not necessarily true that instructions were not given, so it is possible for the conclusion to be false even if this premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because there are two possible worlds in which the conclusion could be false: (1) instructions were given but not explained clearly, and (2) instructions were explained clearly but not given. In both cases, the conclusion would be false.",
