If Ann exercises, then it is impossible for her to have exercised strenuously, since the two statements contradict each other. Therefore, if the premise 1 is true, then the conclusion cannot be true as well.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it leads to a logical contradiction when the premises are both true.",
