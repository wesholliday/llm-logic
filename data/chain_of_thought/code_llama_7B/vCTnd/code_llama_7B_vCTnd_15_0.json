The first premise states that if the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly. This means that if the room was tidied, then there must be some condition or circumstance under which it was not tidied thoroughly.\n\nThe second premise states that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. This means that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then there must be some condition or circumstance under which it was not tidied.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is simply a restatement of the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises in a straightforward manner.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
