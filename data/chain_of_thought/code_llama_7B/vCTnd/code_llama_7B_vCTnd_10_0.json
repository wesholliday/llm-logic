            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and the validity of each step. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Premise 1: If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\n2. Premise 2: If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\n3. Conclusion: If advice was not offered, then helpful advice was not offered.\n\nLet's evaluate each step in turn:\n\n1. Premise 1: This premise is a conditional statement, which means it has two parts: the antecedent (if advice was offered) and the consequent (it was not helpful advice). The antecedent is true if advice was offered, and the consequent is true if the advice was not helpful.\n2. Premise 2: This premise is also a conditional statement, with an antecedent (if helpful advice was offered) and a consequent (then advice was not offered). The antecedent is true if helpful advice was offered, and the consequent is true if advice was not offered.\n3. Conclusion: This conclusion is a conditional statement, with an antecedent (if advice was not offered) and a consequent (then helpful advice was not offered). The antecedent is true if advice was not offered, and the consequent is true if helpful advice was not offered.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of each step:\n\n1. Premise 1: This premise is logically valid because it is a conditional statement with a clear antecedent and consequent. The antecedent is \"if advice was offered,\" which means that if advice was offered, then the conclusion must be true (i.e., the advice was not helpful).\n2. Premise 2: This premise is also logically valid because it is a conditional statement with a clear antecedent and consequent. The antecedent is \"if helpful advice was offered,\" which means that if helpful advice was offered, then the conclusion must be true (i.e., advice was not offered).\n3. Conclusion: This conclusion is logically valid because it is also a conditional statement with a clear antecedent and consequent. The antecedent is \"if advice was not offered,\" which means that if advice was not offered, then the conclusion must be true (i.e., helpful advice was not offered).\n\nIn summary, all three premises are logically valid, and the conclusion follows from them. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.",
