This means that we can assume that the book was written by someone else, and that person could be James or someone else entirely.\n\nThe conclusion of this argument is also a negative statement, which suggests that the book might not have been written by James. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. It is possible that the book was written by James, but it is also possible that it was written by someone else.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.",
