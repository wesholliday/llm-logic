This means that we can assume that the vampire was not necessarily awake.\n\nThe conclusion of this argument is also a negative statement, which suggests that the vampire might not have been awake. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise only asserts that it is not the case that the vampire must have been awake, and does not provide any information about whether or not the vampire was actually awake.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.",
