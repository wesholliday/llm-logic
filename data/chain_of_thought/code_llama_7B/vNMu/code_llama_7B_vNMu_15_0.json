This means that the assumption being made is that the shoes are not necessarily in the closet.\n\nThe conclusion of this argument is also a negative statement, which suggests that the shoes might not be in the closet. This conclusion follows logically from the premise, as it implies that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because it starts with a false assumption and leads to a true conclusion.",
