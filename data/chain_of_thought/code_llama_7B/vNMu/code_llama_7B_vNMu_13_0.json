This means that the toy may or may not be in the toy box.\n\nThe conclusion of this argument is also a negative statement, which suggests that the toy might not be in the toy box. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only asserts that it is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, and it does not provide any information about whether or not the toy actually is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.",
