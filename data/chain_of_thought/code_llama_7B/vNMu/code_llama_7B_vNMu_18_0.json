This means that the notebook may or may not be in the drawer, and we cannot conclude with certainty that it is not in the drawer based on this premise alone.\n\nThe conclusion of this argument is also a negative statement, which asserts that the notebook might not be in the drawer. This means that the argument is logically valid if the premise is true and the conclusion follows from it. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that the notebook is not in the drawer based on this argument alone, because the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
