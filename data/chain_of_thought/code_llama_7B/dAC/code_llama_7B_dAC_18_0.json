In this case, the condition is that the doll was plastic. Therefore, we can deduce that the truck was metal only if the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 3: We are also given the fact that the truck was metal. This means that the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can deduce that the doll was plastic.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
