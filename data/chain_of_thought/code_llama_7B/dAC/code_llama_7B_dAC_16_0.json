This implies that the shirt being cotton does not necessarily mean that the pants are denim.\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that the pants were denim.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we cannot deduce that the shirt was cotton based solely on the fact that the pants were denim. This is because the first statement does not necessarily imply that the shirt being cotton implies that the pants are denim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot deduce that the shirt was cotton based on the information provided in the two statements.",
