In this case, the condition is that the car was red.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is true regardless of any conditions. In this case, the statement is \"The truck was blue\".\n\nStep 4: We can deduce that the car was red because the first statement implies that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since we know that the truck was blue, and the first statement implies that the truck was blue only if the car was red, it follows that the car must have been red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can deduce that the car was red from the given statements.",
