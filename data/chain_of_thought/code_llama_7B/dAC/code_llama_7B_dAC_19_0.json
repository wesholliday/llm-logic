This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nStep 3: We are also given the fact that Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball, which implies that she did not watch football (since the first statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball).\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we have deduced that Tom did not watch football.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
