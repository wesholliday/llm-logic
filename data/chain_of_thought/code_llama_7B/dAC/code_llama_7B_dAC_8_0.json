The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies that if the vampire were to become awake, it would cause the mummy to also become awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that the vampire is currently awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the vampire is awake based on these two statements alone. We need additional information or evidence to support the conclusion that the vampire is awake.",
