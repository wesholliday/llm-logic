            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This means that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow.\n\nStep 3: We are also given that the banana is yellow.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can deduce that the apple is not red, since the first statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, and we have already established that the banana is yellow.\n\nStep 5: Since the apple is not red, it must be some other color. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the apple is green.\n\nStep 6: Now, let's consider the first statement again. If the apple was red, then the banana would have been yellow. But since we know that the apple is not red (we assumed it to be green), and we also know that the banana is yellow, this means that if the apple were red, then the banana would not be yellow.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we can deduce that the apple is not red, since the first statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, and we have already established that the apple is not red (we assumed it to be green).\n\nStep 8: Since we have deduced that the apple is not red, and we also know that the banana is yellow, this means that the apple must be green.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the apple is green, since we have established that it is not red, and we have also established that it is yellow (since the banana is yellow).\n\n### Answer: Yes",
