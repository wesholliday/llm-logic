However, it does not necessarily follow that the antecedent is also true if the consequent is true.\n\nFor example, suppose Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta because they both like spicy foods. In this case, the conditional statement would still be true, even though Sue did not choose pizza specifically because she likes spicy foods.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that Sue chose pizza from the premises \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta.\"",
