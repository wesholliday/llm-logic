This statement is independent of the first one and does not affect our ability to deduce anything from it.\n\nStep 4: Based on the two statements we have been given, we cannot deduce that Ben ate pasta. The first statement only implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but it does not state that Ben actually ate pasta. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
