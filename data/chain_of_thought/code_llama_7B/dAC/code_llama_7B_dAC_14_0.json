In this case, the condition is that the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is true regardless of any conditions. In this case, the statement is simply \"The wolf was in the den\".\n\nStep 4: We can deduce that the wolf was in the den because the second statement is true.\n\nStep 5: If the wolf was in the den, then it must have been in a den.\n\nStep 6: The bear was not in the cave, so it cannot be in the den.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we can deduce that the bear was not in the cave.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
