            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies something only if the condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"Jeff played basketball\", and the implication is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 4: We want to deduce whether Jeff played basketball or not. To do this, we need to look at the conditional statement and see if it implies anything about Jeff playing basketball.\n\nStep 5: Since the conditional statement implies that Amy played tennis only if Jeff played basketball, we can conclude that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball. This means that we can deduce \"Jeff played basketball\" from the information given in the two statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
