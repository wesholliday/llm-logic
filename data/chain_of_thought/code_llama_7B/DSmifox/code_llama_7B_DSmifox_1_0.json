The first premise states that the flugel might not be zargled, which means it could be either zargled or blimmed.\n2. The second premise states that either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed. This implies that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n3. However, the first premise does not necessarily imply that the flugel is blimmed. It could be zargled, but still not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from these two premises.",
