The first statement suggests that the splat might not be quanked, which means it could be in a different state than being quanked.\n2. The second statement states that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed, which implies that the splat is in a specific state (either quanked or morphed).\n3. However, the first statement does not provide any information about the state of the splat, so we cannot infer that it is morphed based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"no.\"",
