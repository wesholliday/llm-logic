The first statement suggests that the twonk might not be plinked, while the second statement states that either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished. This creates a logical contradiction, as both statements imply that the twonk is varnished. Therefore, we cannot infer that the twonk is varnished based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
