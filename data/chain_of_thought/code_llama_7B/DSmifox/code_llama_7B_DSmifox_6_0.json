The first premise, \"The grommet might not be plopped,\" suggests that the possibility of the grommet being plopped does not exist.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed,\" implies that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from these two premises because the first premise rules out the possibility of the grommet being plopped, and the second premise only applies if the grommet is not plopped.\n\n### Answer: No",
