The first statement suggests that the sneg might not be supported, but it does not necessarily mean that it is cramped. It could simply mean that the sneg is not being properly supported, which could be due to various reasons such as a lack of foundation or insufficient support.\n2. The second statement states that either the sneg must be supported or it is cramped. This implies that if the sneg is not supported, then it must be cramped. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sneg is cramped just because it is not supported. It could simply mean that the sneg is not being properly supported, which could be due to various reasons such as a lack of foundation or insufficient support.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg is cramped based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make this conclusion.",
