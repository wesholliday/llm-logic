The first premise states that the shank might not be nugged, which means it could be either nugged or plooked.\n2. The second premise states that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked. This implies that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n3. However, the first premise does not necessarily imply that the shank is plooked. It could still be nugged, even if it might not be nugged according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank is plooked\" from these two premises.",
