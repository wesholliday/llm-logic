The first premise states that the glip might not be tragged, which means it could be either tragged or slogged.\n2. The second premise states that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n3. However, we are given no information about whether the glip is actually tragged or slogged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip is slogged based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The glip is slogged\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.",
