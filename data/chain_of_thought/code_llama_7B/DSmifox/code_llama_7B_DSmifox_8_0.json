The first premise states that the sprocket might not be daggled, and the second premise states that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nHere's a counterexample to disprove the inference:\n\n1. The sprocket might not be daggled.\n2. Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\n3. The sprocket is not cranked.\n\nIn this scenario, the first premise states that the sprocket might not be daggled, but the second premise states that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. However, the third premise states that the sprocket is not cranked, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket is cranked from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
