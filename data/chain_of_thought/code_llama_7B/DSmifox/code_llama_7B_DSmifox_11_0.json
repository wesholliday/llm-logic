The first premise states that the flight might not be zimmed, which means it could be either zimmed or blummed.\n2. The second premise states that either the flight must be zimmed or it is blummed. This means that if the flight is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n3. However, the first premise also states that the flight might not be zimmed, which means that it could still be zimmed.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flug is blummed\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given information.",
