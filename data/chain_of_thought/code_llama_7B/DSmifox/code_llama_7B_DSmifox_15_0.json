The first sentence suggests that the dreb might not be spent, which means it could still have value or be useful in some way.\n2. The second sentence states that either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed. This implies that if the dreb is not spent, then it is vroombed.\n3. However, the first sentence does not necessarily imply that the dreb is not vroombed. It could still be vroombed even if it is not spent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from these two sentences alone.",
