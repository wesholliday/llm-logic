The first premise, \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged,\" states that the glip can either be slogged or tragged.\n2. The second premise, \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged,\" states that it is not true that the glip must be tragged.\n3. The conclusion, \"The glip is slogged,\" states that the glip is slogged.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premises because the second premise does not logically entail the conclusion. In other words, it is possible for the glip to be tragged even if it must not be tragged. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the glip is slogged based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"no.\"",
