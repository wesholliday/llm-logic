The first premise states that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. This means that if the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the smip must be lupped. This means that the smip cannot be lupped, regardless of whether it is shripped or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the smip is not shripped, then it is not possible for it to be lupped. This means that \"The smip is shripped\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
