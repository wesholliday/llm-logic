The first premise, \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned,\" states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surged. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surged.\n2. The second premise, \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned,\" states that it is not the case that the fleeg must be surged. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it does not have to be surged.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" is false.\n\n### Answer: No",
