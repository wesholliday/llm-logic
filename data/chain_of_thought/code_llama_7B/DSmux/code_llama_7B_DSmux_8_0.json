The first premise states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. This means that if the sprocket is not cranked, then it must be daggled.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that if the sprocket is not cranked, then it cannot be daggled.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the sprocket is not cranked, then it must be cranked. This is a contradiction, since we have been given that the sprocket is not cranked and therefore cannot be cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" from \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" together with \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\"",
