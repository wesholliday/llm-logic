The first premise states that either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. This means that there are two possible cases: (a) the fribble is snurgled, or (b) the fribble must be crinked.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This means that the fribble cannot be crinked, regardless of whether it's snurgled or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the fribble is snurgled, then it must be snurgled and not crinked. However, if the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked.\n4. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises. In fact, the conclusion is a tautology, which means that it follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" from \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" together with \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\"",
