The first premise states that either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. The second premise states that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\nBased on the given premises, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked. This is because if the whiffle must be tinked, then it cannot also be shanked (as stated in the second premise). Therefore, the only possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
