The first premise states that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This means that there are two possible cases: (a) the splat is morphed, or (b) the splat must be quanked.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked. This means that the splat cannot be quanked, regardless of whether it's morphed or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the splat is morphed, then it must be morphed and not quanked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat is morphed. It could also be that the splat is not morphed but still cannot be quanked.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from the given premises.",
