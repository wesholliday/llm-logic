The first premise states that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This means that the smonk cannot be plagged, regardless of whether it is vreebled or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it cannot be plagged. This does not necessarily mean that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from these two premises.",
