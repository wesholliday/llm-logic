The first premise states that either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. This means that if the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the shank must be nugged. This means that the shank cannot be nugged, regardless of whether it's plooked or not.\n3. Therefore, if the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged. But this contradicts the second premise, which states that the shank cannot be nugged.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The shank is plooked\" from \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" together with \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n\n### Answer: No",
