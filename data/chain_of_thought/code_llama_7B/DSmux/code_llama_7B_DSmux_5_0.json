The first premise states that either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled. This means that there are two possible cases: either the zinger is fraggled, or it must be smoogled.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This means that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the zinger is fraggled. It could also be that the zinger is both fraggled and smoogled at the same time.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger is fraggled\" from \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" together with \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\"",
