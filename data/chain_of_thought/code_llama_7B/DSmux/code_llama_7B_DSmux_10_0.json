The first premise states that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. This means that if the wug is not sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that the wug cannot be garpled, regardless of whether it's sproinged or not.\n3. Therefore, if the wug is not sproinged, then it cannot be garpled, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled\" together with \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n\n### Answer: No",
