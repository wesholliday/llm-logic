The first premise states that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. This means that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the flob must be movated. This means that the flob cannot be movated, regardless of whether it's skizzled or not.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated. However, this conclusion does not necessarily mean that the flob is skizzled. In fact, it could be that the flob is not skizzled and cannot be movated.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated\" together with \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\"",
