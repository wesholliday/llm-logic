The first premise states that \"the whiffle is not tinked.\" This means that the whiffle is not made of tin, which is a metal that is often used in the production of whiffles.\n\nThe second premise states that \"either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\" This means that either the whiffle is made of tin (tinked) or it is not made of tin (shanked).\n\nNow, we need to consider the conclusion that we are trying to draw. The conclusion states \"the whiffle is shanked.\" This means that the whiffle is not made of tin, which was already established in the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked based on the given premises.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
