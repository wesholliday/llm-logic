The first premise states that the sprocket is not daggled, which means it does not have a daggle (a small hole or indentation).\n2. The second premise states that either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n4. However, this conclusion does not necessarily mean that the sprocket is cranked. It could also be that the sprocket is not cranked but has a daggle instead.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" from \"The sprocket is not daggled\" together with \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\"",
