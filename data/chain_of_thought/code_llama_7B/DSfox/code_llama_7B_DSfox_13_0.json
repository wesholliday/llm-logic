The first premise states that the glip is not tragged, which means it cannot be both tragged and slogged at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the glip is tragged or it is slogged. This statement is a tautology, as it simply restates what we already know about the glip's properties.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The glip is slogged\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given information.",
