The first premise states that the smip is not lupped. This means that the smip is not in a state of being lumped, which is one of the possible states described by the second premise.\n2. The second premise states that either the smip is lupped or it is shripped. This means that if the smip is not lupped (as stated in the first premise), then it must be shripped.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The smip is shripped\" from the given premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
