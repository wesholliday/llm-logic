The first premise states that the splat is not quanked, which means it cannot be both quanked and morphed at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed. This implies that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat is both quanked and morphed at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from \"The splat is not quanked\" and \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"",
