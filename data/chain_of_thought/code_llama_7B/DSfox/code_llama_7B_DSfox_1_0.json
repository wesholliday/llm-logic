Therefore, if we combine these two statements, we get a logical contradiction: if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed, but if it is not blimmed, then it cannot be zargled. This means that neither statement can be true, and we have reached a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from \"The flugel is not zargled\" and \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\"",
