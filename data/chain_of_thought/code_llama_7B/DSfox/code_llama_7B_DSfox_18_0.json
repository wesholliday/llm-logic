The first premise states that the shank is not nugged, which means it is not being nugged at all.\n2. The second premise states that either the shank is nugged or it is plooked. This implies that the shank could be both nugged and plooked simultaneously.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shank is plooked based on these two premises alone. It's possible that the shank is not plooked but is instead being nugged.\n\n### Answer: No",
