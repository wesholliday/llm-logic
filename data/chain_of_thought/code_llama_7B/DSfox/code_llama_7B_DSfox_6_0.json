The first premise states that the grommet is not plopped, which means it cannot be both plopped and sploffed at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed. This implies that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from these two premises because the first premise states that the grommet is not plopped, which contradicts the second premise.\n\n### Answer: No",
