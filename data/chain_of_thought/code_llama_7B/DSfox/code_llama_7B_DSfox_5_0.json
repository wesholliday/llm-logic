The first premise states that the zinger is not smoogled, which means it cannot be both smoogled and fraggled at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled. This statement implies that the zinger can be either smoogled or fraggled, but not both.\n3. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The zinger is fraggled\" from these two premises. The first premise states that the zinger is not smoogled, and the second premise only allows for one of two possibilities (smoogled or fraggled), but it does not rule out the possibility of the zinger being both smoogled and fraggled at the same time.\n\n### Answer: No",
