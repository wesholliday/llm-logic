The first premise states that the sneg is not sproted, which means it cannot be supported.\n2. The second premise states that either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled. This means that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n3. However, we know from the first premise that the sneg is not sproted, so we cannot conclude that it is crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg is crampled\" from these two premises.",
