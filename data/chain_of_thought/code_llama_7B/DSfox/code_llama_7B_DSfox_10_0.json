The first premise states that the wug is not garpled, which means it cannot be both garpled and sproinged at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged. This means that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given information.",
