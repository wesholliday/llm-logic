The first statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it would plop the frink. However, the second statement states that the grommet did not plop the frink, which contradicts the assumption made in the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
