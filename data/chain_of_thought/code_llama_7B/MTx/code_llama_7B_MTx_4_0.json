Therefore, this premise is valid.\n\nPremise 2 is also logically consistent with the definition of \"crinkle.\" The fribble did not crinkle, so it cannot have been snurgled. Therefore, this premise is valid as well.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nBased on our evaluation of the premises, we can conclude that the conclusion \"The fribble was not snurgled\" logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
