In this case, the antecedent is \"If the smonk was vreebled,\" and the consequent is \"The smonk plagged.\"\n\nPremise 2: The smonk did not plagged.\nThis premise is a negative statement, which means that it is true if the opposite of what is stated in the statement is true. In this case, the opposite of \"The smonk plagged\" is \"The smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate whether these two premises are consistent with each other:\n\n* If the antecedent (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the consequent (the smonk plagged) must be false. However, we know that the smonk did not plagged, which means that the antecedent is false. Therefore, this premise is not consistent with the conclusion.\n* If the consequent (the smonk plagged) is true, then the antecedent (the smonk was vreebled) must be true. However, we know that the smonk did not plagged, which means that the consequent is false. Therefore, this premise is also not consistent with the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, neither of these premises are consistent with the conclusion, and we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from them.\n\n### Answer: No",
