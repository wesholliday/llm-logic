MP states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then we can infer the consequent as true. In other words, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then we can infer Q as true.\n\nStep 4: We apply MP to the given premises:\n\nP1: If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled. (True)\nP2: The wug was not garpled. (True)\n\nStep 5: We check whether we can infer \"The wug was not sproonged\" from these premises using MP.\n\nStep 6: We conclude that we cannot infer \"The wug was not sproonged\" from the given premises because the conditional statement in P1 is false (i.e., it does not logically follow that if a wug was sproonged, then it was garpled). Therefore, we write:\n\n### Answer: No",
