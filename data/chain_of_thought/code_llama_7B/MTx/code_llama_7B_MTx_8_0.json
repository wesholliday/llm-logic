The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies that if the sprocket is cranked, it will be daggled. However, the statement \"The sprocket was not daggled\" does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not cranked. It could have been cranked but not daggled for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked based on the given information.",
