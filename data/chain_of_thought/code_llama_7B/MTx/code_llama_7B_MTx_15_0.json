The conclusion states that the dreb was not vroombed, but it is not necessarily true that the dreb was not vroombed if the dreb was spended. In fact, it is possible that the dreb was vroombed even though it was spended. Therefore, the argument does not logically follow from the premises and cannot be used to infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\n### Answer: No",
