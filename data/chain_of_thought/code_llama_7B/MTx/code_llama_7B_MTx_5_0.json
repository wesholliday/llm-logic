To do this, we need to apply the rules of inference.\n\nRule of Inference: If A implies B and A is false, then B must be false.\n\nApplying the rule of inference, we can conclude that if the zinger was fraggled, then it would have been smoogled. However, since the zinger was not smoogled, it follows that it was not fraggled. Therefore, we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\n### Answer: Yes",
