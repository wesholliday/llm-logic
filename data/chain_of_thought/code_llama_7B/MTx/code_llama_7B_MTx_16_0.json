The statement \"If the sneg was cramped, then the sneg sprouted the frink\" implies that if the sneg was cramped, it would have sprouted the frink. However, the statement \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" does not necessarily mean that the sneg was not cramped. It could be that the sneg was cramped but did not sprout the frink for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg was not cramped based on the given information.",
