If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. (Premise 1)\n2. The fleeg did not surn. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the fleeg was not bluttered. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the argument using logical reasoning.\nWe can evaluate the validity of the argument using logical reasoning as follows:\n\n1. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n2. The premise \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have surned.\n3. The premise \"The fleeg did not surn\" is a negative statement that asserts that the fleeg did not surn.\n4. Therefore, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true, and we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nStep 5: Formulate an answer based on the evaluation of the argument using logical reasoning.\nBased on the evaluation of the argument using logical reasoning, we can formulate an answer as follows:\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered from the premises \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" and \"The fleeg did not surn.\"",
