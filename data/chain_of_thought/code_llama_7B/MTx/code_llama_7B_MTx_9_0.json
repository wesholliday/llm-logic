If we assume that \"The twonk was plinked\", then we know that it must have been varnished, since the first statement implies that if the twonk is plinked, then it is varnished. Therefore, if we assume that \"The twonk was not plinked\", then we can conclude that it must not have been varnished, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that \"The twonk was not plinked\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
