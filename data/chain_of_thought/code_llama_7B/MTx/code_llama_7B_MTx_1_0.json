The flugel was not zargled.\n\nStep 2: We can infer that the flugel was not blimmed because if the flugel was blimmed, then it would have been zargled by premise 1. However, since the flugel was not zargled, it cannot have been blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
