The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" implies that if the shank was plooked, it would have been nugged. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shank was not plooked.\n\nFor example, suppose the shank was plooked but not nugged. In this case, the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" would still be true, even though the shank was not actually nugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked based on the given information.",
