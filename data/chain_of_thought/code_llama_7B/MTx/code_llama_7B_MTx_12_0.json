The first statement implies that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lifted the zoint. However, the second statement states that the smip did not lift the zoint, which means that the smip was not shripped. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the smip was not shripped based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
