The first premise, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" states that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer,\" states that either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n3. From these two premises, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer. In fact, we can only conclude that the notebook is either sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer, but we cannot rule out the possibility that it is both.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The notebook is in the drawer\" cannot be logically inferred from these two premises.",
