The first premise, \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen,\" states that the phone cannot be ringing in the kitchen.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room,\" states that either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n3. The conclusion, \"The phone is in the living room,\" states that the phone is in the living room.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer this conclusion from the given premises because the first premise states that the phone cannot be ringing in the kitchen, while the second premise states that either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. This means that the phone could be in the living room even if it is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The phone is in the living room\" from \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\" together with \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\"",
