This means that the pen may be on my desk, but it does not have to be.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag. This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second premises, we can infer that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
