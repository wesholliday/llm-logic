The first premise states that it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that there may be other reasons why the cookies could be in the jar, such as being brought directly from the oven or being stored in a different location.\n2. The second premise states that either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cookies are in the jar, as there may be other reasons why they could be in the jar (e.g., being brought directly from the oven).\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar\" from these two premises.",
