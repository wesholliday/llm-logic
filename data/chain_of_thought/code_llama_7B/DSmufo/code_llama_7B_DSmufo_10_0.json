The first premise states that the missing sock must not be under the bed, and the second premise states that either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. This creates a logical contradiction, as both statements are true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
