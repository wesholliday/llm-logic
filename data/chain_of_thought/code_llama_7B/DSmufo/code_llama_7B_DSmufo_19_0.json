The first premise, \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist,\" states that the watch cannot be on his wrist.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser,\" states that either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n3. From these two premises, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser. In fact, we can only conclude that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" does not logically follow from the given premises.",
