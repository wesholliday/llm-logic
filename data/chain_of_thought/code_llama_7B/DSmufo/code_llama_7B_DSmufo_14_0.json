The first premise, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" states that the condition of the milk being chilled in the fridge is not necessary for its presence to be on the counter. This means that there are other possibilities, such as the milk being on the counter, which are not ruled out by this premise.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter,\" states that either the milk must be chilled in the fridge or it must be on the counter. This means that there is a necessary connection between the two possibilities: if the milk is not chilled in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n3. However, the first premise does not necessarily imply that the milk is on the counter. It only implies that the condition of the milk being chilled in the fridge is not necessary for its presence to be on the counter. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The milk is on the counter\" from these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The milk is on the counter\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.",
