This means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n\nStep 2: The second premise states that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n\nStep 3: From the first and second premises, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
