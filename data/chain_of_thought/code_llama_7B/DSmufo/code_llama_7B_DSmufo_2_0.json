This means that there are other possibilities for the location of the book, such as being on the shelf.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This means that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second premises, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
