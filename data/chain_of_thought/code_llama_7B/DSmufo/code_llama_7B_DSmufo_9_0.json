The first premise states that the missing puzzle piece does not have to be blending in on the floor, which means it could still be in the box or somewhere else entirely. The second premise states that either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box, but it does not necessarily mean that it is in the box. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
