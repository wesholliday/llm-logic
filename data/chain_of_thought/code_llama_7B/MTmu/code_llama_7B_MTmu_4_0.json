The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars. It could be that the alien visited Mars and the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter, even if the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given premises.",
