The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This means that if the dog was inside, it is necessary that the cat was outside.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the cat must have been outside. This means that there are cases where the cat could have been outside even if the dog was inside.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The dog was not inside\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the dog was inside or outside.\n\n### Answer: No",
