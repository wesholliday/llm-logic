            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two premises to consider. The first premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" The second premise is \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether we can infer the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from these two premises. To do this, we need to analyze the relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary is not at the wedding, then Sue cannot be at the wedding either.\n\nStep 4: The second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue may or may not have been at the wedding, but we cannot conclude that she was definitely at the wedding.\n\nStep 5: Based on these two premises, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding if and only if Sue was not at the wedding. If Sue was not at the wedding, then it is possible that Mary was also not at the wedding. However, if Sue was at the wedding, then it is not possible for Mary to have been at the wedding as well.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from these two premises if and only if Sue was not at the wedding. If Sue was at the wedding, then we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
