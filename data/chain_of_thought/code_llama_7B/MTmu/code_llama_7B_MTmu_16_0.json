This does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton. It could be that the shirt was not cotton but still had a denim pant.\n\nFor example, let's say the shirt was made of a blend of cotton and polyester. The pants were also made of denim, but they were not necessarily cotton. In this case, both statements would be true: if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim, and it's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the given premises.",
