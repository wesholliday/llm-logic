The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" does not logically entail the conclusion \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This is because the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is true even if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of why we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (premise)\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (conclusion)\n3. Therefore, it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza (inference)\n\nIn this argument, we can see that the conclusion \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\" does not logically entail the conclusion \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This is because the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is true even if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given premises.",
