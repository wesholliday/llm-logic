            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" and \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This means that if the apple is red, there is a logical connection between the apple and the banana, and therefore, it is not necessarily true that the apple was not red.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This does not necessarily mean that the banana was not yellow. It could be that the banana was yellow, but there is no logical connection between the apple and the banana.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" from these two premises. The first premise only establishes a logical connection between the apple and the banana if the apple is red, while the second premise does not necessarily rule out the possibility that the banana was yellow even if the apple was red.\n\n### Answer: No",
