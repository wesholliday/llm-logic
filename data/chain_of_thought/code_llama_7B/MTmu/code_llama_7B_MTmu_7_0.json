This means that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must also have finished the race.\nPremise 2 states that it is not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris may or may not have finished the race.\n\nStep 4: Now we need to consider how these two premises relate to each other. If Alex did finish the race, then Chris must have finished the race by the first premise. However, if Chris did not finish the race, then it is not the case that he must have finished the race by the second premise.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" from these two premises. This is because if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must have finished the race, but if Chris did not finish the race, then it is not the case that he must have finished the race.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
