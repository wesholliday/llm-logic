            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" and \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the cake was chocolate\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement is a negative statement, which means it asserts that the opposite of what is being said in the first statement is not true. In this case, the opposite of \"the muffins must have been blueberry\" is \"the muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nStep 4: We can infer from the first statement that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must be true.\n\nStep 5: We can infer from the second statement that it is not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the opposite of what was said in the first statement is not true.\n\nStep 6: Based on the two statements, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. However, it is also not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the cake was not chocolate.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
