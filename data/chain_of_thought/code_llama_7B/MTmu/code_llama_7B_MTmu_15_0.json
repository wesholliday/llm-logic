The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin must not have taken a train.\n\nStep 4: The second premise states that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that Erin may or may not have taken a train.\n\nStep 5: Based on these two premises, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. This is because if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin must not have taken a train (as stated in the first premise). However, it is also possible that Erin may have taken a train (contrary to the second premise).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane\" from these two premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
