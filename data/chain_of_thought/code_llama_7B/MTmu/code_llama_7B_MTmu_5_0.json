This does not necessarily mean that Jeff did not play basketball. It only means that if he did play basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This does not contradict the first premise, as it only means that there are other possible scenarios where Amy may or may not have played tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on the given premises.",
