The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy will also be awake.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that there are cases where the mummy may not have been awake even if the vampire was awake.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the vampire is awake or asleep. All we know is that there are cases where the mummy may not have been awake even if the vampire was awake.\n\n### Answer: No",
