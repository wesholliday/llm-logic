This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then it is necessary that Kate also ate the salad. However, the second premise states that it is not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad. This does not necessarily mean that Ben did not eat pasta, as there may be other possible explanations for why Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from these two premises alone.",
