This does not necessarily mean that the doll is not plastic. In fact, it could be the case that the doll is plastic and the truck is also plastic.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that there are other possibilities for what the truck might have been made of, such as wood or glass. It does not necessarily mean that the truck was not metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on these premises alone. We would need additional information to make a conclusion about the matter.",
