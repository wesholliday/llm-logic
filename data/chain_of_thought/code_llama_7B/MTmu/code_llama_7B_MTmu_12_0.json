            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" and \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have also gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that Lucy may or may not have gone to the zoo, but it is not a necessary condition for her to have done so.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the first statement and the fact that Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo based on the second statement. This means that we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park, but it is possible that Lucy may or may not have gone to the zoo.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
