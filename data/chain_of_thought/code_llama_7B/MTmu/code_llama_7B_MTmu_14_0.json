To do this, we need to analyze the relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This means that if the bear is in the cave, it logically follows that the wolf is also in the den.\n\nStep 4: The second premise states that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This means that it's possible for the wolf to be in a different location than the den.\n\nStep 5: Based on these two premises, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in a different location than the den. This implies that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
