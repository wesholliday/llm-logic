            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" and \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second premise states that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football.\n\nFor example, suppose Tom did watch football and Jen did not watch basketball. Then, the first premise would be true (since Tom watched football), but the second premise would be false (since Jen did not watch basketball). Therefore, we cannot infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" is not logically implied by the given premises.",
