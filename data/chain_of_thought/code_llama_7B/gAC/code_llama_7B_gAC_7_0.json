The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, but it does not necessarily mean that one event caused the other. It is possible that both events occurred independently of each other.\n\nFor example, suppose that Alex and Chris are both running in a race, and they both finish at the same time. In this case, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" would be true, but it would not necessarily mean that one event caused the other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true based solely on the fact that \"Chris finished the race\" is true and \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true.",
