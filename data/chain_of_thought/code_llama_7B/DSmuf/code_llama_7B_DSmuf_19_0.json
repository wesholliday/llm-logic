The first premise states that either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. This means that there are two possible scenarios: either the watch is on his wrist, or it is charging on the dresser.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that the watch cannot be on his wrist, which implies that it must be charging on the dresser.\n3. However, we are given no information about whether the watch is actually charging or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.",
