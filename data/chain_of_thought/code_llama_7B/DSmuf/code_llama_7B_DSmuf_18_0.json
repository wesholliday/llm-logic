The first premise states that either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. This means that there are two possible scenarios: either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, or it is in the drawer.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand, even if it is in the drawer.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer, but we cannot infer that it is sitting on the nightstand.\n\n### Answer: No",
