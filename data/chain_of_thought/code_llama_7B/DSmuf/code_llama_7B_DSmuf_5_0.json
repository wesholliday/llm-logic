The first premise states that either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that there is a possibility that the cookies are in the jar, even if they are not necessarily hidden in the pantry.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that the assumption that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry is false.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the cookies may be in either the pantry or the jar, but we cannot say for certain where they are without further information.",
