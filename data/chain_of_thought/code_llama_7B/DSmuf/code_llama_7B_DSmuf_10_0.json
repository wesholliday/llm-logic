The first premise states that either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. This means that there are two possible locations for the missing sock: under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that we cannot conclude that the missing sock is necessarily under the bed, even if the first premise suggests that it might be there.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\" from these two premises alone. We need additional information or evidence to support this conclusion.",
