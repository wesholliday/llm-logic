The first premise states that either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box. The second premise states that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nIf we assume that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box. This is because if the missing puzzle piece were blending in on the floor, then the first premise would be false (since the missing puzzle piece cannot be both blending in on the floor and in the box). Therefore, if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the given premises.",
