The first premise states that either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This means that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, which was already established by the first premise.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair, but we cannot infer that it is not draped over the chair based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
