The first premise states that either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. This means that there are two possible scenarios: (a) the phone is ringing in the kitchen, or (b) the phone is not ringing in the kitchen and is instead in the living room.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that there is at least one scenario where the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, even if it is in the living room.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The phone is in the living room\" from these two premises. The first premise only rules out the possibility that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen, but it does not necessarily mean that the phone is in the living room.",
