The first premise states that either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. This means that there is a possibility that the keys are in the drawer, even if they are not dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet, regardless of whether they are in the drawer or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" from these two premises. The absence of a possibility does not necessarily mean that it is certain that the keys are in the drawer.",
