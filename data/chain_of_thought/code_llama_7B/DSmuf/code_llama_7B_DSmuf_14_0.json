The first premise states that either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. This means that there are two possible situations: (a) the milk is chilling in the fridge, or (b) the milk is on the counter.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the situation described in the first premise cannot occur.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter, but we cannot infer that it is chilling in the fridge.\n\n### Answer: No",
