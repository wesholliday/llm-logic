This means that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book cannot be on the table.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf. Therefore, \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
