The first premise states that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that there may be a situation where Fido is not in the garden, even though he must be inside.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that Fido may be outside the garden, even if he must be inside.\n\n### Answer: No",
