The first statement implies that either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf. It does not rule out the possibility that the book is on the shelf but not resting on the table.\n2. The second statement suggests that the book might not be resting on the table, which means it could be on the shelf or somewhere else entirely.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on these two statements. We need additional information to make this inference.",
