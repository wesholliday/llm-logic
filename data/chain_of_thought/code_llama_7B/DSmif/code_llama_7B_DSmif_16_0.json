This can be inferred from the word \"either\" in the first statement.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the pen might not be on my desk.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that the pen is definitely in my bag. However, we can infer that it is more likely to be in my bag than on my desk.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
