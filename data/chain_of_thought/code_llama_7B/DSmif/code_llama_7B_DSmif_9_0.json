Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box (premise 1)\n2. The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor (premise 2)\n3. If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box (logical deduction)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
