If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer. This is because if the keys were dangling in the cabinet, it would contradict the fact that they are not dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this inference does not necessarily mean that the keys are in the same position as when they were first placed in the drawer. They may have been moved or rearranged since then.",
