The first premise states that there is a possibility that the jacket may not be draped over the chair, while the second premise states that it is not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair. The conclusion then logically follows from these two premises by stating that it is possible for the jacket to be on the floor instead of being draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
