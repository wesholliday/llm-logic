The first premise states that there is a possibility that the toy may not be in the toy box, which is a reasonable assumption. The second premise states that it is not necessarily the case that the toy must be in the toy box, which is also a reasonable assumption. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from these two premises and is a valid argument.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
