The first premise states that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, which means that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag. The second premise states that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, which means that there is no necessary connection between the sunglasses being in her bag and any other statement. Therefore, the conclusion that the sunglasses could be somewhere else follows logically from the premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
