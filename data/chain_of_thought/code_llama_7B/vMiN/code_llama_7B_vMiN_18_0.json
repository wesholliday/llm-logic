The first premise states that the notebook might not be in the drawer, which means that there is a possibility that it is not in the drawer. The second premise states that it is not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer, which means that there is no necessary connection between the two statements. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises and is a valid argument.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
