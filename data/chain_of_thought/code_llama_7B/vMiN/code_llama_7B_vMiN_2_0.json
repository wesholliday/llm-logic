The first premise states that the griffin might not have been in the forest, which means that there is a possibility that the griffin was not actually in the forest. The second premise states that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, which means that there is no necessary connection between the two statements. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises and is a valid argument.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
