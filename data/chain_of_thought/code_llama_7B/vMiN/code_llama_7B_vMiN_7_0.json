The first premise states that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, while the second premise states that it is not necessary for Alex to have finished the race. The conclusion then asserts that it is possible for Alex to have not finished the race, which is consistent with both premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
