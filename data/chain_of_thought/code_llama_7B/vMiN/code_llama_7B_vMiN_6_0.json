It is not necessarily true, but it is a possible scenario.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\nThis conclusion is a statement that it is not logically necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza. It is a possibility that she did not choose pizza, and it is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate whether this argument is logically valid. The argument is logically valid if the premises entail the conclusion. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. However, it is not necessarily true, and it does not entail the conclusion \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
