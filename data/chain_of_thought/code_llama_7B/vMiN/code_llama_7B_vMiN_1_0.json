However, it does not necessarily follow that she must have been at the wedding. In fact, if we assume that Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it is possible that she was not at the wedding after all.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because it does not establish a necessary connection between the premise and conclusion. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and there are other possibilities that could have led to the conclusion.",
