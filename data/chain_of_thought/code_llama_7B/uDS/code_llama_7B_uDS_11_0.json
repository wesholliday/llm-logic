The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the newspaper must be in the driveway. This is because if the newspaper were sitting on the porch, then it would not be possible for it to also be in the driveway (since it is not sitting on the porch). Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
