In this case, it is not under the bed, as we have already established that the missing sock is not under the bed. Therefore, if the missing sock is in the laundry basket, it must be in a location other than under the bed.\n2. The missing sock is not in the laundry basket. In this case, it could be under the bed or in any other location that is not the laundry basket.\n\nSince we have already established that the missing sock is not under the bed, and there are only two possible locations for the missing sock (the laundry basket and any other location), we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
