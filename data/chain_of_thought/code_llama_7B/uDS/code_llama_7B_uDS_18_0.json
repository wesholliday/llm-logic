The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer. This is because if the notebook were sitting on the nightstand, then it would not be sitting on the nightstand, which contradicts our second statement. Therefore, if the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
