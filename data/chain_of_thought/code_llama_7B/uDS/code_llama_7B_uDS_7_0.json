The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car. This is because if the umbrella were tucked away in the closet, then it would not be possible for it to be in the car at the same time. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
