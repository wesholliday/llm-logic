The first statement simply states that the splat might not have quanked, while the second statement states that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the splat was not morphed.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a splat that is not morphed but still quanks. In this case, the first statement would be true (the splat might not have quanked), while the second statement would also be true (if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked). Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that the splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
