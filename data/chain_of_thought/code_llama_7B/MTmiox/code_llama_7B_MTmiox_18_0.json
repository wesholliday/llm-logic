The first statement is a possibility that the shank was not nugged, but it does not necessarily mean that the shank was not plooked.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement that states if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. This statement does not provide any information about whether the shank was plooked or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked based on these two statements alone.",
