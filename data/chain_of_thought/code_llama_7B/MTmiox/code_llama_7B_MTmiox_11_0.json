The first statement is a possibility that the flight was not hijacked, but it does not necessarily mean that the flight was not bombed.\n2. The second statement is a conclusion that if the flight was hijacked, then it must have been bombed. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the first statement.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flight was not bombed based on these two statements alone.",
