The first statement suggests that the smip might not have lulled the zoint, while the second statement states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lulled the zoint. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the smip was not shripped.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the smip was shripped but still managed to lull the zoint. In this case, both statements would be true, and we could not infer that the smip was not shripped based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
