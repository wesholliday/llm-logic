The first statement does not provide any information about whether the smonk was vreebled or not. The second statement only states that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged, but it does not say anything about whether the smonk was actually vreebled or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled based on these two statements alone. We would need additional information to make this inference.",
