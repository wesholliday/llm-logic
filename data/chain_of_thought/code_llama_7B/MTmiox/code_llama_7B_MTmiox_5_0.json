The first statement is a hypothetical scenario, so it does not necessarily imply that the zinger was not smoogled. It simply means that there is a possibility that the zinger was not smoogled.\n2. The second statement is a logical consequence of the first statement. If the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. This does not necessarily mean that the zinger was not fraggled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zinger was not fraggled based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a definitive conclusion about the zinger's status.",
