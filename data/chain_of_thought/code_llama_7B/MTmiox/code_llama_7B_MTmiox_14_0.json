The first statement is a possibility that the clug was not snugged, but it does not necessarily mean that the clug was not fleeked.\n2. The second statement is an assumption that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors at play that prevented the clug from being snugged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a definitive conclusion about the clug's fleeking status.",
