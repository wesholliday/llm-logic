The first statement is a possibility that the wug was not garpled, but it does not necessarily mean that the wug was not sproonged.\n2. The second statement is an assumption that if the wug was sproonged, then it must have been garpled. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as there could be other factors at play that led to the wug being sproonged but not garpled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not sproonged based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a definitive conclusion.",
