The first statement is a possibility that the flob did not move, but it does not necessarily mean that the flob was not skizzled.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement that states that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the flob was skizzled or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled based on these two statements alone. We need more information to make a conclusion about the flob's status.",
