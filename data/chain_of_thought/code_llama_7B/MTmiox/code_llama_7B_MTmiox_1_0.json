The first statement does not provide any information about whether the flugel was blimmed or not. The second statement only provides a conditional statement that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. This does not necessarily mean that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nFor example, let's say the flugel was indeed blimmed and zargled. Then, based on the second statement alone, we would conclude that the flugel was not blimmed. However, this conclusion is based solely on the assumption that the flugel must have been zargled if it was blimmed. It does not necessarily follow that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was not blimmed based on these two statements alone. We would need additional information or evidence to make such an inference.",
