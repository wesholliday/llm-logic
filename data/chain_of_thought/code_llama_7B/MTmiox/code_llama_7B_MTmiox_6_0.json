The first statement suggests that the grommet might not have plopped the frink, while the second statement states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the grommet was sploffed but did not plopp the frink. In this case, the first statement would still be true (the grommet might not have plopped the frink), while the second statement would also be true (if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed based on these two statements alone.",
