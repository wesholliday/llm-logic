The first premise states that the sprocket might not have been daggled, and the second premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nFor example, suppose the sprocket was cranked but not daggled. In this case, the first premise would be true (the sprocket might not have been daggled), and the second premise would also be true (if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled). However, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked based on these two premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked from the given premises. ### Answer: No",
