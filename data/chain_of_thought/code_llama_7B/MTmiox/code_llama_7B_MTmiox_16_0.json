The first statement suggests that the sneg might not have sprouted the frink, while the second statement implies that if the sneg was cramped, then it must have sprouted the frink. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the sneg was not cramped.\n\nFor example, suppose the sneg was cramped but still managed to sprout the frink. In this case, both statements would be true, and we could not infer that the sneg was not cramped based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg was not cramped based on the two statements provided.",
