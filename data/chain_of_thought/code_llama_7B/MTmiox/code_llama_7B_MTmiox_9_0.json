The first statement suggests that the twonk might not have been varnished, while the second statement states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nFor example, suppose the twonk was indeed plinked and was therefore varnished. In this case, both statements would be true, but we could not infer that the twonk was not plinked based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid.",
