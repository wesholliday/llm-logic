The first statement simply states that the fleeg might not have been surnamed, while the second statement states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surnamed. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nFor example, suppose the fleeg was indeed bluttered but was not surnamed. In this case, the first statement would still be true (the fleeg might not have been surnamed), while the second statement would also be true (if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surnamed). Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
