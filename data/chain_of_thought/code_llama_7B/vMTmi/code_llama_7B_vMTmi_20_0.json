This is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is false.\n2. The second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow. This is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or false.\n3. The conclusion states that the apple was not red. This is also an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or false.\n4. Therefore, if we assume that the first premise is true (i.e., the apple was red), then the second premise must be false (i.e., the banana was not yellow). This leads to a logical contradiction, which means that the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
