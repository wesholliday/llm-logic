The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. For example, Tom might have watched football but Jen might not have watched basketball. Therefore, this premise is not necessarily true.\n2. The second premise states that Jen might not have watched basketball. This premise is a conditional statement as well, and it is not necessarily true that Jen might not have watched basketball. For example, Jen might have watched basketball but Tom might not have watched football. Therefore, this premise is not necessarily true.\n3. The conclusion states that Tom did not watch football. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises if they are both true. However, if either of the first two premises is false, then the conclusion does not follow logically from them. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
