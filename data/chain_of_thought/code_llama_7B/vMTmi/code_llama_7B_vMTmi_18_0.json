This means that if the doll is plastic, it follows that the truck must also be metal.\n2. The second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This does not necessarily contradict the first premise, as it only provides a possibility for the truck to not be metal.\n3. The conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This means that the first premise is false, since if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal.\n4. Therefore, this argument is logically invalid because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: No.",
