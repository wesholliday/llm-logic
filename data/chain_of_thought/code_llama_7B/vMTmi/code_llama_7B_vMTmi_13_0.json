This is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is true.\n2. The second premise states that the truck might not have been blue. This is an unconditional statement, meaning that it is always true regardless of whether the car was red or not.\n3. The conclusion states that the car was not red. This is also an unconditional statement, meaning that it is always true regardless of whether the car was red or not.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from both premises, even if one of the premises is false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
