This is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true and the consequent (Chris finishing the race) is true.\n2. The second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This is an uncertain statement, which means that it is possible for Chris to have finished the race or not.\n3. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race. This is a negative statement, which means that it is false if the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true and the consequent (Chris finishing the race) is true.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the first premise is true, the second premise is uncertain, and the conclusion is false. This means that the argument is not logically invalid, but it may be semantically invalid if the second premise is actually false.\n\nAnswer: No",
