This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. For example, if Mary was at the wedding but Sue was not, then this would be a counterexample to the first premise.\n2. The second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This is also a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that Sue might not have been at the wedding. For example, if Sue was at the wedding, then this would be a counterexample to the second premise.\n3. The conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. This is a simple statement, and it is not necessarily true that Mary was not at the wedding. For example, if Mary was at the wedding, then this would be a counterexample to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because there are possible counterexamples that can disprove both premises and the conclusion.",
