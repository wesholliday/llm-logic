The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake. For example, the vampire could have been asleep while the mummy was awake.\n2. The second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake. This premise is a possibility that is not necessarily true. It is possible that the mummy was indeed awake, and this possibility should be taken into account when evaluating the argument's validity.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that the vampire was not awake. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, but it does not necessarily follow from the second premise. If the mummy was indeed awake, then the vampire could have been asleep, and this possibility should be taken into account when evaluating the argument's validity.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because it relies on a conditional statement that may not be true, and it does not take into account all possible scenarios.",
