The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn being in the forest. However, this does not mean that the argument is invalid.\n2. The second premise states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This premise is a possibility that is not necessarily true. It is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest even if the griffin was there.\n3. The conclusion states that the griffin was not in the forest. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, but it does not follow logically from the second premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
