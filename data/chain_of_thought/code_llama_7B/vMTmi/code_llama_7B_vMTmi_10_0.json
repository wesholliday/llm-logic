The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. For example, the dog could have been inside but the cat could have been outside as well.\n2. The second premise states that the cat might not have been outside. This premise is a possibility that is not necessarily true. It is possible that the cat was outside even if the dog was inside.\n3. The conclusion states that the dog was not inside. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, but it does not follow logically from the second premise. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
