This means that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nStep 3: We are given the additional information that the book was not written by James.\n\nStep 4: Based on the previous steps, we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel because it was not written by James and the first statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' together with 'The book was not written by James'?\" is yes.",
