            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The car was not red\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies something only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the car was red.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an affirmative statement, which means that it asserts something to be true. In this case, it states that the car was not red.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the truck was blue if the first statement is true and the second statement is false. This is because if the car was red and the truck was blue, then the conditional statement would imply that the truck was blue. However, since the car was not red, the conditional statement does not apply, and we cannot infer anything about the truck's color.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
