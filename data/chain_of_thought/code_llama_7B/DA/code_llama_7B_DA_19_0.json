The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and there are no logical fallacies in the argument.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is true or false.\n\nThe argument is true because it is a valid inference drawn from the given premises. If Tom did not watch football, then it is likely that Jen did not watch basketball either, as they are both sports-related activities. However, this conclusion does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball at all; there may be other factors that could have influenced her watching habits.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
