            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was not plastic\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies something only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an affirmative statement, which means that it asserts something to be true. In this case, it states that the doll was not plastic.\n\nStep 4: Based on the first statement and the second statement, we can infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would also be metal. However, since the doll was not plastic, it is possible that the truck could still be metal or non-metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the truck was not metal based solely on these two statements. We need more information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Answer: No",
