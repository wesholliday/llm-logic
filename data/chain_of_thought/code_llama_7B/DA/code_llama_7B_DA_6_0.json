The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies a causal relationship between the two choices, but it does not necessarily mean that Bob did not choose pasta if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFor example, suppose Sue and Bob are both vegetarians and they both want to order a pizza. In this case, Sue might choose pizza because she is a vegetarian and wants to avoid meat, but Bob might choose pasta because he likes pasta and does not care about being vegetarian.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta based on the given information.",
