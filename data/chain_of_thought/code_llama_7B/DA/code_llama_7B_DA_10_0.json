In this case, the antecedent is \"If the dog was inside\" and the consequent is \"The cat was outside\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement is a simple statement that states that the dog was not inside.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the cat was not outside if the first statement is true, because then the consequent (the cat being outside) must be false. However, we are given no information about whether the first statement is true or false, so we cannot make a definitive inference about the cat's location based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The cat was not outside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' together with 'The dog was not inside'?\" is no. We cannot make a definitive inference about the cat's location based on these two statements alone.",
