            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a certain outcome if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"Alex finished the race\", and the outcome is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement is an affirmative statement, which means that it asserts something to be true. In this case, it asserts that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nStep 4: Based on the two statements given, we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either. This is because the first statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and the second statement asserts that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
