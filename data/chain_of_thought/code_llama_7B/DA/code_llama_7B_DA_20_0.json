(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the conclusion can be logically inferred from the premises.\n\n* Can we infer that the banana was not yellow based on the information provided?\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based on the information provided. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies if the condition stated in the antecedent (if clause) is true. In this case, the antecedent states that the apple was red, but we are given no information about the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot infer that the banana was yellow based on this statement alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
