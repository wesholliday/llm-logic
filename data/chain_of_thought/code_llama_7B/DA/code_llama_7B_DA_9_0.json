Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 2: We need to determine if we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on these two statements.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we need to analyze the first statement and see if it is logically consistent with the second statement.\n\nStep 4: The first statement states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 5: We are given a third statement: Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This contradicts the first statement, as it implies that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
