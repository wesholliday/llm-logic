This means that if the apple is not red, then the banana cannot be yellow.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the banana is not yellow.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the apple must not be red.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
