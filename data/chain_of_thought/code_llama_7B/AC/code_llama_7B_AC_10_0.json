In this case, the antecedent is \"If the dog was inside,\" and the consequent is \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nStep 3: The second statement is a simple statement that states that the cat was outside.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the dog was inside because if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was inside based on the given information.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
