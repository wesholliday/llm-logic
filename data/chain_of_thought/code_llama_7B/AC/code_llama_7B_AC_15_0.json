This means that if the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: We are given the second statement, \"Erin took a train\". This statement is independent of the first statement and does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane based on the two statements alone. The fact that Erin took a train does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\n### Answer: No",
