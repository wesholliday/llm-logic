            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"Sue was at the wedding\". This means that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since Sue was at the wedding, it follows that if Mary was there, then she must have been as well. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is a logical conclusion from the given statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
