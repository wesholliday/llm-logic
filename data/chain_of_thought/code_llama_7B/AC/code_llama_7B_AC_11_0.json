In this case, we do not have enough information to determine whether the cake was chocolate or not, so we cannot say for sure whether Premise 1 is valid or not.\nPremise 2 is a simple statement that is always true if the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, it is valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion that can be logically inferred from the given premises.\nSince we cannot determine whether Premise 1 is valid or not, we cannot logically infer anything about the cake being chocolate based on the information provided. However, since Premise 2 is always true if the muffins were blueberry, it follows that the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, the conclusion that can be logically inferred from the given premises is \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n### Answer: Yes",
