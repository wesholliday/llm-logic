            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This means that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck does not have to be metal.\n\nStep 3: We are given a third statement: \"The truck was metal\". This statement tells us that the truck is indeed metal.\n\nStep 4: From statements 1 and 2, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, since we have been given a third statement that states the truck is metal, it follows that the doll cannot be plastic. Therefore, the correct answer is \"no\".\n\n### Answer: No",
