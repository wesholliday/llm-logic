In this case, the condition is that the car was red.\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that the truck was blue.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the car was red because the first statement implies that the truck was blue, and we have already established that the truck was blue. Therefore, if the car was red, then the truck would also be blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
