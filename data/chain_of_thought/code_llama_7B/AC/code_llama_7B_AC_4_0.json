This means that if there is a connection between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter, then we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: We are given the second statement, \"The robot visited Jupiter\". This means that the robot did indeed visit Jupiter.\n\nStep 4: From statements 1 and 2, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since we have already established that the robot visited Jupiter (statement 2), we can conclude that the alien must have visited Mars (inference).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The alien visited Mars\" from \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
