In this case, the condition is that the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 3: The second statement simply states that the wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the bear was in the cave because the first statement implies that the wolf was in the den only if the bear was in the cave. Therefore, if we know that the wolf was in the den, we can conclude that the bear must have been in the cave as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
