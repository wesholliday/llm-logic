The premise \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled\" implies that if the tizzer is on, then the goom will be snurpled. However, the additional premise \"and the plink light is out\" does not necessarily imply that the goom will be snurpled. In fact, it could be that the plink light is out for a reason other than the tizzer being on. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom will be snurpled.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: No",
