The first statement only provides a condition for the second statement to be true, but it does not logically imply the second statement on its own.\n\nFor example, if the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will indeed be glonked. However, this does not mean that the snarf will be glonked simply because the krimp is in the zool. The second statement requires additional information about the zool being zapped, which is not provided in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one alone.",
