The premise \"If the fribble is in the snarp, then it is flugged\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the fribble is in the snarp, then it will be flugged. However, the conclusion \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged\" is a more specific conditional statement that requires both the fribble to be in the snarp and the snarp to be flooping for the fribble to be flugged. This additional condition makes the conclusion more restrictive than the premise, which means that the argument is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
