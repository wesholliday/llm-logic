The additional condition of \"the quib being squinked\" does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon. (Given)\n2. The quib is squinked. (Additional condition)\n3. Therefore, if the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon. (Inference)\n\nHowever, this inference does not hold water. The additional condition of \"the quib being squinked\" does not logically follow from the original statement, so we cannot infer that it must be true in all cases where the first statement is true.",
