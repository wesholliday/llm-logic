The additional assumption of \"zooned\" in the second premise is not mentioned in the first premise and therefore cannot be inferred.\n\nTherefore, we can infer: If the ploofle is blorped, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\nBut we cannot infer: If the ploofle is blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple.",
