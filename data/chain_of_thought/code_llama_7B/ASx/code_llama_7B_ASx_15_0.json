The additional clause \"and the troon is zibbled\" does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of why:\n\n1. The original statement is \"If the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked.\"\n2. We can infer that if the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked. This is because the word \"then\" in the original statement implies a causal relationship between the two events.\n3. The additional clause \"and the troon is zibbled\" does not logically follow from the original statement. It is not necessary for the blip to be floinked, and it is not implied by the original statement.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked.",
