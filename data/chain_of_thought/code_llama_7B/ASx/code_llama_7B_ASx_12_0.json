The additional information about the \"crungle\" and its \"splooting\" does not affect the outcome of the previous statement. The relationship between the splotch and the bloop is solely based on the action of bringingle the splotch, which has no bearing on whether or not the crungle is splooted. Therefore, we cannot make a general inference about the floosh of the bloop based on the presence or absence of the crungle.\n\n### Answer: No",
