The klank is a type of object that can be hooped, and the wuggy is a type of creature that can sink. If the klank is hooped, then it will have a rounded shape, which could potentially cause it to sink in water. Therefore, if the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat (i.e., it is not floating), then the wuggy will sink.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
