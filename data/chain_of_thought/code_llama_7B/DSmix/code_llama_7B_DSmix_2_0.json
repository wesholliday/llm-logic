We can infer that the wug is flooped because if it were not flooped, then it would have to be bimmed (according to the first premise). However, we are given that the wug might not be bimmed (according to the second premise), which means that it could also be flooped.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
