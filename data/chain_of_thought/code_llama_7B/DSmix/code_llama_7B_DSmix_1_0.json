The first premise states that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This means that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n2. The second premise states that the flugel might not be zargled. This does not necessarily mean that the flugel is blimmed. It could simply mean that the flugel is not zargled for some other reason.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from these two premises. The first premise only establishes a necessary condition for the flugel to be blimmed, while the second premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support that conclusion.",
