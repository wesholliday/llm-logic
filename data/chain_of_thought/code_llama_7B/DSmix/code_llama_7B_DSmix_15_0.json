The first sentence suggests that the dreb can either be vroombed or spent, but does not provide any information about its current state.\n2. The second sentence implies that the dreb might not be spent, but it does not necessarily mean that it is vroombed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dreb is vroombed based on these two sentences alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
