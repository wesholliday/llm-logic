The first sentence states that either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped. This means that there are two possible outcomes: either the grommet is sploffed, or it must be plopped.\n2. The second sentence states that the grommet might not be plopped. This means that there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped, even if it must be plopped according to the first sentence.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from these two sentences alone. The first sentence only provides a general rule for what can happen with the grommet, while the second sentence introduces an exception that could cause the grommet not to be plopped even if it must be.\n\n### Answer: No",
