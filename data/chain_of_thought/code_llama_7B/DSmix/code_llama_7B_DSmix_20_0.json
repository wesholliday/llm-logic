The first premise states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned.\n2. The second premise states that the fleeg might not be surned. This does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered. It could simply mean that the fleeg is not surned for some other reason.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from these two premises. The first premise only establishes a necessary condition for the fleeg to be bluttered, while the second premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support that conclusion.",
