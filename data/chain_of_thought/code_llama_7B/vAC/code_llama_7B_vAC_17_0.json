There is no evidence or reason to believe that Ben ate pasta, so this premise is not true in all possible worlds.\n\nPremise 2: Kate ate salad\nThis premise is true in all possible worlds because it is a factual statement about what Kate did eat.\n\nConclusion: Ben ate pasta\nBased on the first premise, we can infer that Ben ate pasta if Kate ate salad. However, since the first premise is not logically valid, this conclusion does not follow from the premises and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
