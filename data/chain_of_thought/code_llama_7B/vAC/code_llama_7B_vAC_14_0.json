The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the bear were in the cave, the wolf would be in the den. However, we can assume that this premise is true for the sake of argument.\n2. The second premise states that the wolf was in the den. This premise is a simple statement and is therefore true by definition.\n3. The conclusion states that the bear was in the cave. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, since if the bear were in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den (by assumption). Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
