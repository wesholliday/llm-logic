This premise is sound because it is based on a reasonable assumption about the relationship between the book and its author.\n\nThe second premise \"The book is a mystery novel\" is also a factual statement that is independent of the first premise. It is sound because it is based on a reasonable observation about the book's genre.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The book was written by James\" is also a factual statement that is independent of the first two premises. Therefore, this argument is complete.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it has both sound and complete premises.",
