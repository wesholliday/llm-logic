            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its validity step by step.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the first premise.\nThe first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. For example, if the shirt was made of a different type of fabric, such as polyester or silk, then the pants could still be denim. Therefore, this premise is not logically valid.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise.\nThe second premise states that the pants were denim. This premise is a simple statement and is therefore logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states that the shirt was cotton. This conclusion follows from the first premise, which states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Therefore, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, we have already established that this is not necessarily true based on the first premise. Therefore, this conclusion is also not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the first premise is not logically valid and the conclusion follows from an untrue premise.",
