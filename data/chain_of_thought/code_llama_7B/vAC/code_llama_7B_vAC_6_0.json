The if-clause states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the if-clause and the then-clause separately.\n\t+ If-clause: Is it true that Sue chose pizza?\n\t\t- No, because we are not given any information about what Sue chose.\n\t+ Then-clause: Is it true that Bob chose pasta?\n\t\t- Yes, because we are told that Bob chose pasta.\n* Therefore, the if-clause is false and the then-clause is true, which means that this premise is not logically valid.\n\nPremise 2: Bob chose pasta.\n\n* This premise is a simple statement that states that Bob chose pasta.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement.\n\t+ Is it true that Bob chose pasta?\n\t\t- Yes, because we are told that Bob chose pasta.\n* Therefore, this premise is logically valid.\n\nConclusion: Sue chose pizza.\n\n* This conclusion is a simple statement that states that Sue chose pizza.\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the statement.\n\t+ Is it true that Sue chose pizza?\n\t\t- No, because we are not given any information about what Sue chose.\n* Therefore, this conclusion is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
