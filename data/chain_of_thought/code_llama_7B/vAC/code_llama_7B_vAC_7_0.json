This means that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must have also finished it.\n2. The second premise states that Chris finished the race is true. This means that Chris actually did finish the race.\n3. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the first two premises. If Alex finished the race and Chris did too, then we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
