However, it is not necessarily true that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. There could be other factors that led to Sue's attendance at the wedding without necessarily involving Mary. Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a necessary condition for the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\". However, it is not sufficient on its own to establish the conclusion. There could be other factors that led to Mary's attendance at the wedding without necessarily involving Sue. Therefore, this argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
