The if-clause states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the antecedent and the validity of the consequent.\n\t+ Antecedent: If Jeff played basketball, then the antecedent is true. However, it is not specified in the argument that Jeff actually played basketball. Therefore, this premise is not logically valid.\n\t+ Consequent: If Amy played tennis, then the consequent is also true. However, it is not specified in the argument that Amy actually played tennis. Therefore, this premise is not logically valid.\n\nPremise 2: Amy played tennis.\n\n* This premise is a simple statement that states that Amy played tennis.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the statement itself.\n\t+ Statement: If Amy played tennis, then the statement is true. Therefore, this premise is logically valid.\n\nConclusion: Jeff played basketball.\n\n* This conclusion is a simple statement that states that Jeff played basketball.\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the statement itself.\n\t+ Statement: If Jeff played basketball, then the statement is true. However, it is not specified in the argument that Jeff actually played basketball. Therefore, this conclusion is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the premises are not logically valid and the conclusion is not logically valid given the premises.",
