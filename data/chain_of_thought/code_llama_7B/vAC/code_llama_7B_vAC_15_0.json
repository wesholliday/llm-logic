The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This premise is true because it is possible for Sam to have taken a plane and Erin to have taken a train.\n2. The second premise states that Erin took a train. This premise is also true because Erin did indeed take a train.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Sam took a plane. This conclusion is based on the first premise, which implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Therefore, if the first premise is true (i.e., Sam took a plane), then the second premise must also be true (i.e., Erin took a train).\n4. The argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement in the first premise and an unconditional statement in the second premise, which allows for the conclusion to be drawn.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
