This means that if the assumption (A) that the apple was red is true, then the conclusion (B) that the banana was yellow must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that the banana was yellow. This means that the assumption (B) that the banana was yellow is true.\n3. The conclusion states that the apple was red. This means that if the assumption (A) that the apple was red is true, then the conclusion (C) that the apple was red must also be true.\n4. Therefore, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
