This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise.\n\n* The second premise states that the mummy was awake.\n* This premise is a simple statement, which means it has only one part: an antecedent (the mummy was awake).\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth value.\n\nTruth Value of Premise 2: T\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the second premise is also logically valid. This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* The conclusion states that the vampire was awake.\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement, which means it has two parts: an antecedent (the mummy was awake) and a consequent (the vampire was awake).\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table.\n\nTruth Table for Conclusion:\n\n| Mummy Awake | Vampire Awake |\n| --- | --- |\n| T | T |\n| F | T |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the conclusion is logically valid if the mummy was awake. However, since the second premise states that the mummy was indeed awake, this means that the conclusion is also true in this case.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
