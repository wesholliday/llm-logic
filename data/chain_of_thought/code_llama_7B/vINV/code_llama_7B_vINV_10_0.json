The conditional statements are structured as follows: \"If A, then B\" (premise 1) and \"If not A, then not B\" (premise 2). The conclusion also uses a conditional statement, but it is structured differently than the premises.\n\nThe argument is valid because it does not rely on any false assumptions or contradictory statements. The premises are both true, and the conclusion logically follows from them. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
