            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its premises and conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\nConclusion: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement in both premises and the conclusion. The conditional statements are structured as follows:\n\n* Premise 1: If P (the vampire was awake), then Q (the mummy was awake).\n* Premise 2: If not P (the vampire was not awake), then not Q (the mummy was not awake).\n* Conclusion: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premises because it is a restatement of the second premise in terms of the negation of the first premise. This type of argument is known as a \"reductio ad absurdum\" argument, which relies on the assumption that the negation of the premise leads to an absurd conclusion. In this case, if the vampire was not awake, then it would be impossible for the mummy to be awake because the vampire's state of being is incompatible with the mummy's state of being. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
