The conditional statements are structured as \"if...then\" clauses, which means that each premise states a condition that must be met for the conclusion to follow. In this case, the condition is that the doll was plastic or not plastic, respectively.\n\nThe argument also uses a logical equivalence between the two conditional statements in the premises and the conclusion. This means that if the first premise is true (i.e., the doll was plastic), then the second premise must be false (i.e., the truck was not metal). Similarly, if the second premise is true (i.e., the doll was not plastic), then the first premise must be false (i.e., the truck was not metal).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement in both premises and the conclusion, and it establishes a logical equivalence between them.",
