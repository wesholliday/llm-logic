The if-clause states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the if-clause and the truth of the then-clause.\n\t+ If the if-clause is true (i.e., if Sue did choose pizza), then the then-clause must also be true (i.e., Bob did choose pasta).\n\t+ However, we don't know whether Sue actually chose pizza or not, so we can't say for sure that the if-clause is true.\n* Therefore, this premise is not logically valid because it relies on an unverifiable assumption (i.e., that Sue did choose pizza).\n\nPremise 2: If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the antecedent) and a then-clause (the consequent).
