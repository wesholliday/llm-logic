The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen must have watched basketball as well. The second premise states that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball either. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
