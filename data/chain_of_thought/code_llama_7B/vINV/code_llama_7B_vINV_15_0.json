The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This is exactly what the second premise says. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows from the premises in a straightforward and obvious way.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
