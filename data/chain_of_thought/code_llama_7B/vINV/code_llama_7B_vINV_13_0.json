            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its premises and conclusion separately.\n\nPremise 1: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\n* This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the part before the \"then\") and a consequence (the part after the \"then\"). In this case, the if-clause is \"If the car was red,\" and the consequence is \"Then the truck was blue.\"\n* The if-clause states that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue. This means that if the car is red, we can infer that the truck must also be blue.\n\nPremise 2: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement, with an if-clause (\"If the car was not red\") and a consequence (\"Then the truck was not blue\").\n* The if-clause states that if the car was not red, then the truck would not be blue. This means that if the car is not red, we can infer that the truck must also not be blue.\n\nConclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement with an if-clause (\"If the car was not red\") and a consequence (\"Then the truck was not blue\").\n* The if-clause states that if the car was not red, then the truck would not be blue. This means that if the car is not red, we can infer that the truck must also not be blue.\n\nNow, let's evaluate whether this argument is logically valid or not. To do so, we need to consider whether the premises are true and whether they entail the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\n* This premise is a conditional statement, and it is based on an assumption that the car is red. However, we don't know for sure if the car is actually red or not. Therefore, this premise is not necessarily true.\n\nPremise 2: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement, and it is based on an assumption that the car is not red. However, we don't know for sure if the car is actually not red or not. Therefore, this premise is not necessarily true.\n\nConclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement, and it is based on the assumption that the car is not red. However, we don't know for sure if the car is actually not red or not. Therefore, this conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because the premises are not necessarily true, and they do not entail the conclusion.",
