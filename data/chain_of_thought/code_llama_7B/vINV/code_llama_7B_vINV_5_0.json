The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. The second premise states that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
