The conditional statements are structured as follows:\n\n* Premise 1: If P, then Q. (P implies Q)\n* Premise 2: If \u00acP, then \u00acQ. (\u00acP implies \u00acQ)\n* Conclusion: If \u00acP, then \u00acQ. (\u00acP implies \u00acQ)\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premises because it is a restatement of the second premise. The argument is valid because it does not rely on any false assumptions or contradictory statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
