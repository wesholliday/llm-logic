The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. The second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, by modus tollens (a logical rule), we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows from the given premises and leads to a logical conclusion.",
