In this case, the if-clause states that the apple was red, and the implication states that the banana was yellow.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of values for the variables in the argument and indicates whether each combination leads to a true or false conclusion.\n* In this case, the truth table for the first premise would look like this:\n\t+ Apple red | Banana yellow | Conclusion (if-clause) | Conclusion (implication)\n\t+ Yes | Yes | True | True\n\t+ Yes | No | False | True\n\t+ No | Yes | True | True\n\t+ No | No | True | True\n* As you can see, the truth table shows that all four combinations lead to a true conclusion. Therefore, this premise is logically valid.\n\nConclusion: If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\n* This conclusion is also a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the part before the \"then\") and an implication (the part after the \"then\"). In this case, the if-clause states that the apple was not red, and the implication states that the banana was not yellow.\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of values for the variables in the argument and indicates whether each combination leads to a true or false conclusion.\n* In this case, the truth table for the second premise would look like this:\n\t+ Apple red | Banana yellow | Conclusion (if-clause) | Conclusion (implication)\n\t+ Yes | Yes | False | True\n\t+ Yes | No | False | True\n\t+ No | Yes | True | True\n\t+ No | No | True | True\n* As you can see, the truth table shows that all four combinations lead to a true conclusion. Therefore, this conclusion is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument as a whole is logically valid because both of its premises are logically valid and they both lead to the same conclusion.",
