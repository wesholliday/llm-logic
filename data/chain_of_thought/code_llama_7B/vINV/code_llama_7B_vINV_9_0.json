Therefore, this premise is incomplete and cannot be used to draw a conclusion.\n\nPremise 2: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThis premise is also a conditional statement that asserts a causal relationship between two events. It states that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, it does not provide any information about whether Lisa actually did not buy the red shirt or not.
