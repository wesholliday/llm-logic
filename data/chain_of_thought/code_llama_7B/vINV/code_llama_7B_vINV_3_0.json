However, this statement does not provide any evidence or reasons to support this claim. It simply states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel without offering any explanation or justification for this assumption.\n\nPremise 2: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement that asserts that if the book was not written by James, then it must not be a mystery novel. However, this statement does not provide any evidence or reasons to support this claim. It simply states that if the book was not written by James, then it must not be a mystery novel without offering any explanation or justification for this assumption.\n\nConclusion: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement that asserts that if the book was not written by James, then it must not be a mystery novel. However, this statement does not provide any evidence or reasons to support this claim. It simply states that if the book was not written by James, then it must not be a mystery novel without offering any explanation or justification for this assumption.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on unsupported assumptions and does not provide any evidence or reasons to support its conclusions.",
