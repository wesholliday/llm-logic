It is possible for the shirt to be cotton and the pants to be something other than denim. In fact, this is a more likely scenario, as cotton and denim are two different types of fabric.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. We need to consider all possible scenarios and evidence before making any conclusions.",
