It is possible that Bob chose something else entirely, or that he did not make a choice at all.\n\nFor example, suppose Sue chose pizza because she likes pizza, but Bob chose pasta because he likes pasta. In this case, the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, but it does not imply that Bob must have chosen pasta if Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"",
