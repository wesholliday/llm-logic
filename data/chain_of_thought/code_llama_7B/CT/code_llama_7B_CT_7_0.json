The given statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement, \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race?\" This statement is asking us to infer a conclusion based on the premise that Chris did not finish the race. However, we are not given any information about whether or not Alex finished the race.\n\nStep 2: Write your answer.\n\nAfter considering the reasoning and the available information, we can conclude that we cannot infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race?\" from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is because we are not given any information about whether or not Alex finished the race.\n\n### Answer: No",
