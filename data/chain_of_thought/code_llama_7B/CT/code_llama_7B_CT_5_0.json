They are not equivalent.\n\nFor example, suppose Jeff played basketball and Amy did not play tennis. This would satisfy the first statement but not the second statement. In this case, we can say that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true, but \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement alone. We need additional information or evidence to make a conclusion about whether or not Jeff played basketball based on whether or not Amy played tennis.",
