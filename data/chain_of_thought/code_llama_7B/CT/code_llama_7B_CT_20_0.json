            "content": "\nStep 1: Evaluate the given premise.\nThe premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the conclusion (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the conclusion is false.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it implies that if the condition (the banana being not yellow) is true, then the conclusion (the apple being not red) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the premise is false.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the two statements are logically equivalent.\nTo determine whether the two statements are logically equivalent, we need to compare them and see if they have the same form and meaning. The two statements have the same form (both are conditional statements), but their meanings are different. The first statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, while the second statement implies that if the banana is not yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the two statements are logically contradictory.\nTo determine whether the two statements are logically contradictory, we need to compare them and see if they have opposite meanings. The two statements have opposite meanings, which means that they are logically contradictory. If the apple is red and the banana is yellow, then it is not possible for the banana to be not yellow, since it is by definition yellow. Similarly, if the apple is not red, then it is not possible for the banana to be yellow, since the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the two statements are logically contradictory. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'?\" is yes.",
