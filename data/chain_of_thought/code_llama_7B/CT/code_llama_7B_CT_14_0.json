It is a valid inference because it follows logically from the given information. If the wolf was not in the den, then it cannot be inferred that the bear was not in the cave. However, if the wolf was in the den, then it can be inferred that the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The premise states that the bear was in the cave and the wolf was in the den, which implies that the bear was not in the den. Therefore, if the wolf was not in the den, then it can be inferred that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
