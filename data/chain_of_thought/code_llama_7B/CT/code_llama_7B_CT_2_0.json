The conclusion is also logically consistent because it is also a conditional statement with a clear antecedent (the unicorn not being in the forest) and consequent (the griffin not being in the forest).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is deductively valid or inductively valid.\nThe argument is deductively valid because it follows from the premises to the conclusion using a logical inference, which is a deductive reasoning process.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.",
