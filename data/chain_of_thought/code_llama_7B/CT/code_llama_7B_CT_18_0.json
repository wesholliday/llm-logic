In other words, just because the doll was plastic given that the truck was metal, it does not mean that the truck was not metal given that the doll was not plastic.\n\nFor example, imagine that the doll was actually made of wood, even though it looked like plastic. If the truck was metal, then the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" would still be true, but the second statement \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" would not be true in this case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.",
