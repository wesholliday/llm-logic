In this case, the premise is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" If this premise is false, then the conclusion cannot be true either.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the premise is logically valid or not.\nThe premise is a conditional statement, and it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the cake was chocolate,\" which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the premise is not logically valid.\n\nStep 4: Based on the evaluation of the premise and conclusion, determine whether the argument is valid or not.\nThe argument is not valid because the premise is not logically valid. If the premise were to be true, then the conclusion would also be true. However, since the premise is not true, the conclusion cannot be true either. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
