The first statement only implies a causal relationship between Lisa and the red shirt, while the second statement implies a causal relationship between Mark and the blue shirt. It is possible for someone to buy one item without buying the other, even if there is a causal relationship between them.\n\nFor example, suppose Lisa bought the red shirt because she liked the color, but Mark bought the blue shirt because he was trying to match it with his favorite pair of pants. In this case, there is no causal relationship between Lisa and the red shirt, and no causal relationship between Mark and the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.",
