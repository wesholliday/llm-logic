The premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, it does not necessarily follow that Joe did not go to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy did not go to the zoo, such as a lack of interest or a prior commitment. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premise alone.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nNo, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The conclusion states that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premise alone. There could be other reasons why Lucy did not go to the zoo, such as a lack of interest or a prior commitment. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
