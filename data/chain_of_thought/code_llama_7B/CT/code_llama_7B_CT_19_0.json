The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" does not necessarily imply that Tom and Jen have the same preferences or interests. It is possible that Tom watched football because he was interested in it, while Jen watched basketball because she enjoyed it. Therefore, the inference that Tom did not watch football if Jen did not watch basketball is not valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
