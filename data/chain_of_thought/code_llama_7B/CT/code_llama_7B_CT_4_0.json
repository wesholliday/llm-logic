The statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" does not necessarily imply that the robot visited Jupiter if the alien did not visit Mars. It only implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFor example, suppose the alien did not visit Mars but the robot did visit Jupiter. In this case, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter without any information about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\".",
