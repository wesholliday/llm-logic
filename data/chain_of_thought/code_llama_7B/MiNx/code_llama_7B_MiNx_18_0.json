The word \"might\" in this sentence indicates possibility or uncertainty, but it does not necessarily imply a negative conclusion.\n\nFor example, if we know that the shank was not plooked, then we can infer that it is not the case that the shank must have been plooked. However, without additional information, we cannot make any conclusions about the necessity or possibility of the shank being plooked.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The shank might not have been plooked\" does not entail \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked.\"",
