The given statement is a hypothetical scenario where the fribble may or may not have been snurgled, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not snurgled. In fact, it could be that the fribble was indeed snurgled in this hypothetical scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled from the given statement alone.
