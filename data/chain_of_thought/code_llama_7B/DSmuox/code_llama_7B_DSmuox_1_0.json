The first premise, \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled,\" states that the negation of the condition for which the conclusion follows. In this case, the condition is \"the flugel must be zargled.\"\n2. The second premise, \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled,\" states that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This means that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n3. The conclusion, \"The flugel is blimmed,\" states that the flugel is blimmed. This conclusion follows from the second premise, but it does not follow from the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" together with \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\"",
