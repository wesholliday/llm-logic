This means that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second premises, we can infer that \"the whiffle is shanked\" because the whiffle cannot be tinked and must be shanked if it is not tinked.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The whiffle is shanked\" can be logically deduced from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
