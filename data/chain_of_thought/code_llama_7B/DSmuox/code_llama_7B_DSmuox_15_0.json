The first premise states that it is not the case that the dreb must be spent, which means that spending the dreb is not necessary or required.\n2. The second premise states that either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spent. This means that if the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spent.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spent. However, this does not necessarily mean that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from these two premises.",
