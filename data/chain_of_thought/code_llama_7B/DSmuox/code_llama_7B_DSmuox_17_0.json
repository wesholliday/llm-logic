The first premise states that it is not the case that the flob must be moved. This means that the flob can be in its current position without being moved.\n2. The second premise states that either the flob is skizzled or it must be moved. This means that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be moved.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that the flob is either not skizzled or must be moved, but we cannot determine which one it is.",
