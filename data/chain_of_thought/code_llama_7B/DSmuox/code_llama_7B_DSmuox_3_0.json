The first premise states that \"it's not the case that the splat must be quanked,\" which means that the assumption that the splat must be quanked is false.\n2. The second premise states that \"either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This statement implies that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked, but it does not necessarily mean that the splat is morphed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed from these two premises. The first premise states that the assumption that the splat must be quanked is false, and the second premise only implies that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked, but it does not necessarily mean that the splat is morphed.\n\n### Answer: No",
