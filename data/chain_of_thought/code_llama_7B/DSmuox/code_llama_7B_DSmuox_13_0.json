The first premise, \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged,\" states that the opposite of \"the glip must be tragged\" is true. This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must not be tragged.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged,\" states that either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged. This means that if the glip is not slogged, then it must be tragged.\n3. The conclusion, \"The glip is slogged,\" states that the glip is slogged. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, but it does not necessarily follow that the glip is slogged if it is not tragged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The glip is slogged\" from \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" together with \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\"",
