The first premise, \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled,\" states that the wug cannot be garpled.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled,\" states that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\n3. The conclusion, \"The wug is sproinged,\" states that the wug is sproinged.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premises because the first premise states that the wug cannot be garpled, and the second premise states that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled\" together with \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\"",
