The first premise, \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged,\" states that the opposite of the statement \"The smonk must be plagged\" is true. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged,\" states that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n3. The conclusion, \"The smonk is vreebled,\" states that the smonk is vreebled. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, but it does not necessarily follow that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\" together with \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\"",
