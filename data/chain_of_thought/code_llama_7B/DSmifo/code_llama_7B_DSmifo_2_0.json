This means that there is a possibility that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This means that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nStep 4: From statements 1 and 2, we can infer that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf. Therefore, \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
