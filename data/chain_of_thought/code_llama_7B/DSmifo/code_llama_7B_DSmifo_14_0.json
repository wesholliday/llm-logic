The first premise states that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, which means it could be either in the fridge or on the counter. The second premise states that either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter, which implies that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, it must be on the counter. However, this does not necessarily mean that the milk is on the counter. It could be in a different location, such as on a shelf or in a cupboard.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter from these premises.",
