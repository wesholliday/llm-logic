The first statement suggests that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, while the second statement states that either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in your backpack. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack.\n\nFor example, the scarf might be draped on the coat rack but also be stuffed in your backpack as a precautionary measure. In this case, both statements would be true, and we cannot infer that the scarf is only in one place based on these two statements alone.",
