This means that there is a possibility that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. This means that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second statements, we can infer that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box. This implies that \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
