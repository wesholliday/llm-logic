The first statement suggests that the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet, while the second statement states that either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. This creates a logical contradiction, as both statements are mutually exclusive and cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
