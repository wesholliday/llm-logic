The first statement suggests that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, which means it could be anywhere else in the room.\n2. The second statement states that either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. This implies that if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n3. However, we are given no information about the location of the remote control, so we cannot infer its location based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these two statements. The correct answer is \"no.\"",
