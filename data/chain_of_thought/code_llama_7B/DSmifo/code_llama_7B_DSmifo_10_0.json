The missing sock might not be under the bed.\n2. Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket. This is because the second premise states that either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket, and the first premise implies that the missing sock might not be under the bed. Therefore, we can infer that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\n### Answer:\n\nYes.",
