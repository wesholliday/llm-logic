The first statement suggests that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, while the second statement states that either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This creates a logical contradiction, as both statements are mutually exclusive and cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
