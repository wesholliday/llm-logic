This means it is not visible or easily noticeable on the floor.\n2. Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box. This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
