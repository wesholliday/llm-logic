The first statement suggests that the cookies may not be hidden in the pantry, while the second statement states that either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This creates a logical contradiction, as it is impossible for the cookies to be both hidden in the pantry and in the jar at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
