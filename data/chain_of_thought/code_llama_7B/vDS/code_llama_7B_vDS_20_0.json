Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" is not necessarily true if the first premise is false. In other words, the argument is incomplete because it does not provide a sufficient reason for the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
