This statement is a disjunction, which means that it can be read as \"either A or B.\"\n2. The second premise states that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This statement is a negation of the second disjunct (B) in the first premise.\n3. The conclusion states that the remote control is on the coffee table. This statement is a conjunction of the first disjunct (A) and the negation of the second disjunct (B).\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it uses a valid form of reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The first premise provides two possible explanations for the remote control's location, while the second premise eliminates one of those explanations. The conclusion then combines these two explanations in a way that is consistent with the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
