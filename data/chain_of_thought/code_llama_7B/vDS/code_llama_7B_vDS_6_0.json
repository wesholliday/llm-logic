Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The phone is in the living room\" is not necessarily true if the first premise is false. In other words, if the phone is ringing in the kitchen, then it is not in the living room, even though the first premise is true. Therefore, this argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
