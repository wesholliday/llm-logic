This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This is a negation, which means that the statement \"the toy is sitting on the shelf\" is false.\n3. The conclusion states that the toy is in the toy box. This is a positive statement, which means that it must be true.\n4. Since the first premise and the second premise are both true, and the conclusion is also true, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
