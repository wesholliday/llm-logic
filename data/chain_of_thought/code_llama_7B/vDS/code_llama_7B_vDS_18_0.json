This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand. This is a negative statement, which means that the notebook is either in the drawer or it is not sitting on the nightstand.\n3. The conclusion states that the notebook is in the drawer. This is a positive statement, which means that the notebook must be in the drawer if the first premise and the second premise are both true.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it leads to a logical conclusion from its premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
