This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. This is a negation, which means that the statement is false.\n3. The conclusion states that the book is on the shelf. This is a positive statement, which means that it is true.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the premises are both true and the conclusion follows logically from them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
