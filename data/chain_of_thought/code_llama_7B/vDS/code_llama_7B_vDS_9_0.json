This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be blending in on the floor.\n2. The second premise states that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor. This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it cannot be blending in on the floor.\n3. The conclusion states that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be blending in on the floor, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
