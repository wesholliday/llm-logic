This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This is a negation, which means that the opposite of the statement is true. In this case, the opposite of \"the milk is chilling in the fridge\" is \"the milk is not chilling in the fridge\".\n3. The conclusion states that the milk is on the counter. This is a positive statement, which means that it must be true.\n4. Since the first premise and the second premise are both true, and the conclusion is also true, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
