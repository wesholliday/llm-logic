This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. This is a negation, which means that the opposite of the statement is true.\n3. The conclusion states that the cookies are in the jar. This is a positive statement, which means that it must be true.\n4. Therefore, if the first premise and second premise are both true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n5. However, we can see that the first premise is false, since the cookies are hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
