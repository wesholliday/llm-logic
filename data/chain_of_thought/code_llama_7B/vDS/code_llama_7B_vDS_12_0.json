This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This statement contradicts the first premise, as the jacket is not hanging in the closet if it is draped over the chair.\n3. Therefore, the conclusion that the jacket is draped over the chair must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
