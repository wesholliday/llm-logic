(Assume that this statement is true)\nPremise 2: The smonk was not vreebled. (Assume that this statement is true)\nConclusion: The smonk was not plagged.\n\nIf we assume that both premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The smonk was not plagged'?\" is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
