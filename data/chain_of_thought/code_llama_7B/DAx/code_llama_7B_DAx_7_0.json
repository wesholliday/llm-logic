If the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. (Premise 1)\n3.2. The whiffle was not shanked. (Premise 2)\n\nStep 4: We can infer that the whiffle did not tink based on these premises because we have a logical contradiction. If the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked, but if it was not shanked, then it cannot have tinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle did not tink.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
