The sentence \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" implies that if the grommet is sploffed (i.e., it is damaged), then it will plop the frink. However, we are not given any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grommet did not plop the frink based on this sentence alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
