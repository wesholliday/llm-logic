If the wug was sproonged, then its garpling is necessarily true, and the implication holds. However, if the wug was not sproonged, then its garpling is false, and the implication does not hold. Therefore, the truth value of this premise depends on the specific circumstances of the situation.\n\nPremise 2: This premise is always true, as it simply states that the wug was not sproonged.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the conclusion by applying the rules of inference.\n\nConclusion: The wug was not garpled.\n\nInference rule used: Modus ponens (MP)\n\nMP states that if a premise is true and its negation is false, then the conclusion is necessarily true. In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\n2. The wug was not sproonged.\n\nWe can apply MP to these premises to determine the validity of the conclusion. Since the first premise is a logical implication that depends on the specific circumstances of the situation, we cannot use this premise directly to determine the truth value of the conclusion. However, since the second premise is always true, we can use it as a basis for determining the validity of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, if the wug was not sproonged (premise 2), then the conclusion that the wug was not garpled (conclusion) is necessarily true. However, if the wug was sproonged (premise 1), then its garpling is necessarily false, and the implication does not hold. Therefore, the validity of the conclusion depends on whether the wug was sproonged or not.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
