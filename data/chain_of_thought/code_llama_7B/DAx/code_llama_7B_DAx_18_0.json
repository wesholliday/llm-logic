To do this, we need to apply the rules of inference.\n\nRule of Inference: If A implies B and A is false, then B must be false.\n\nApplying the rule of inference, we can conclude that \"The shank was not nugged\" because \"The shank was not plooked\" is false. Therefore, the conclusion \"The shank was not nugged\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
