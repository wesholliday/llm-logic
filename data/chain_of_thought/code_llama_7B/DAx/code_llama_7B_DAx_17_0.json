Therefore, this premise is valid.\n* Premise 2 is a simple statement of fact, and it is also valid.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the conclusion can be drawn from the given premises.\n\nConclusion: The flob was not movated.\n\nInference: Since the flob was not skizzled, and if the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved, it follows that the flob was not moved. Therefore, we can infer that the flob was not movated.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
