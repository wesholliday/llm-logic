The first statement, \"The book is not a mystery novel,\" does not provide any information about the author of the book. It simply states that the book is not a mystery novel, without specifying who wrote it or what its genre is.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel. However, this statement does not provide any information about the author of the book or its genre. It simply states that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on these two statements alone. We need additional information or evidence to make such an inference.",
