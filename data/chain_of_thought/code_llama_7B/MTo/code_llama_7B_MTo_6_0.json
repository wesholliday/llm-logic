The second premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 2: We are asked to infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nReasoning: Based on the previous reasoning, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pizza. Therefore, if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pizza either. This means that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
