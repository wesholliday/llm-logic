In this case, we can use Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nStep 4: We can apply Modus Ponens as follows:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (premise)\n2. Amy did not play tennis (premise)\n3. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (conclusion)\n\nStep 5: The conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" is logically deduced from the premises \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy did not play tennis\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
