This is because the wolf and the bear are two different animals that may or may not have been present in the same location at the same time.\n\nStep 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nReasoning: This statement is a logical consequence of the first premise. If the bear was in the cave, then it must be the case that the wolf was also in the den, since the two animals are related by their shared habitat.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the bear was not in the cave.\n\nReasoning: This conclusion follows logically from the previous premises. If the bear was not in the cave, then it cannot be inferred that the wolf was in the den.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
