            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" and \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement states that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 4: We want to infer whether or not Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 5: To infer whether or not Joe did not go to the park, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. If the second statement is true, then it implies that Lucy went to the zoo if and only if Joe went to the park. Therefore, if we want to infer whether or not Joe did not go to the park, we need to look at the first statement.\n\nStep 6: The first statement states that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 7: Based on the information provided, it is possible for both statements to be true and still have a logical contradiction. For example, if Joe went to the park but Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the second statement would be true but the first statement would be false. Therefore, we cannot infer whether or not Joe did not go to the park based solely on these two statements.\n\nStep 8: The answer is no. We cannot infer whether or not Joe did not go to the park based on the information provided in the two statements.",
