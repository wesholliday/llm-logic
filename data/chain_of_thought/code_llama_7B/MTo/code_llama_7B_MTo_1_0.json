The statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" does not necessarily imply that Mary was also not at the wedding. It is possible that Sue was not invited to the wedding or that she had a prior commitment that prevented her from attending.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" implies that Sue was not present at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's attendance.\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding as well, according to the second statement. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue must have been absent as well.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the information provided.",
