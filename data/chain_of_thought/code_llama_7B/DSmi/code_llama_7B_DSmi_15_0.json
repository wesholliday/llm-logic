The first premise is \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\" The second premise is \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door.\"\n\nStep 2: To infer the conclusion, we need to look at the relationship between the two premises. The first premise suggests that the shoes are either in the closet or they must be lined up by the door. The second premise suggests that the shoes might not be lined up by the door.\n\nStep 3: Based on the information provided, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet. This is because if the shoes were not in the closet, they would need to be lined up by the door, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
