The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, which means it could still be in the drawer or somewhere else entirely. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the notebook is in the drawer based solely on the information provided.",
