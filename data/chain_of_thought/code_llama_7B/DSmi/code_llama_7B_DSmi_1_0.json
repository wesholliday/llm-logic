            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Fido might not be in the garden\".\n\nStep 2: The first statement implies that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside. This can be written as \"If Fido is not in the garden, then Fido is inside.\"\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that it is possible for Fido to be outside of the garden, even if he is not inside.\n\nStep 4: We can combine these two statements by using logical implication, which states that if A implies B, then not B implies not A. In this case, we have \"If Fido is not in the garden, then Fido is inside\" and \"If Fido might not be in the garden, then Fido is not inside.\"\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that if Fido might not be in the garden, then he must be inside. This can be written as \"Fido might not be in the garden implies Fido is inside.\"\n\n### Answer: Yes",
