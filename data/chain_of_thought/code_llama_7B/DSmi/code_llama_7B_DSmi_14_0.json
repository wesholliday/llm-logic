The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter. This is because the first premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge, and the second premise suggests that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
