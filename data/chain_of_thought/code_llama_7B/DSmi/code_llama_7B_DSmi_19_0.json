The statement \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" does not necessarily mean that the watch is charging on the dresser. It could simply mean that the watch is not currently being worn by the person.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" and \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n2. The first statement suggests that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is currently being worn by the person.\n3. The second statement suggests that the watch might not be on the person's wrist, which could mean that it is not currently being worn.\n4. Based on these two statements, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on the information given.\n\n### Answer: No",
