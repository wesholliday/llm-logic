If the book is on the shelf, then it cannot be resting on the table, because that would contradict the first statement. Therefore, if the book is not resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nSo, based on these two statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
