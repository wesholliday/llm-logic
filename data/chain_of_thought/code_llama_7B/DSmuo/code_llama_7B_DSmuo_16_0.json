This means that the pen cannot be on my desk, regardless of whether it is in my bag or not.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk. This means that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second premises, we can infer that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The pen is in my bag\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
