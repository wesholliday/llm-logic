The first premise, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" states that there is no necessary connection between the remote control being hidden under the couch and its location on the coffee table. This means that we cannot conclude that the remote control is necessarily located on the coffee table.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch,\" states that there are two possible locations for the remote control: either it is on the coffee table or it is hidden under the couch. This means that we cannot conclude that the remote control is necessarily located on the coffee table, as there may be other possibilities.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" from \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" together with \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n### Answer: No",
