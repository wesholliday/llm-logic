The first premise states that the missing puzzle piece must not be blending in on the floor, which means it is not present on the floor. The second premise states that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. This implies that if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, it must be blending in on the floor. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
