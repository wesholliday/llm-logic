The first premise states that the missing sock is not under the bed, which means it could be anywhere else in the room or outside the room. The second premise states that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed, but it does not rule out the possibility that the missing sock is in another location entirely. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based on these two premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
