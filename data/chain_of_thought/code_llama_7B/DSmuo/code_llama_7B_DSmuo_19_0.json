The given premises do not entail this conclusion.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" means that it is possible for the watch to be somewhere else, such as on a dresser or in a pocket.\n2. \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" means that if the watch is not charging on the dresser, then it must be on his wrist.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based on these premises alone. We need additional information to make this inference.",
