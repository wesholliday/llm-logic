The first premise, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" states that there is no necessary connection between the notebook being on the nightstand and its presence in the drawer. This means that even if the notebook is in the drawer, it does not necessarily follow that it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand,\" states that there is a necessary connection between the notebook being in the drawer and its presence on the nightstand. This means that if the notebook is in the drawer, then it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The notebook is in the drawer\" from \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" together with \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This is because the first premise states that there is no necessary connection between the notebook being on the nightstand and its presence in the drawer, while the second premise states that there is a necessary connection between the notebook being in the drawer and its presence on the nightstand.\n\n### Answer: No",
