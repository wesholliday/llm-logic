The first premise states that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet, which means it is not necessarily in the car. The second premise states that either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet, which implies that the umbrella could be in the closet even if it is not in the car. Therefore, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car based on these premises alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
