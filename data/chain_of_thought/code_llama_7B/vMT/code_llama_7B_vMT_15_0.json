However, the second premise \"Erin did not take a train\" does not provide any information about whether Sam took a plane or not. Therefore, this argument is not sound because it relies on an unjustified assumption.\n\nCompleteness:\nThe conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" is also a conditional statement that asserts a necessary condition for the conclusion. However, the first premise does not provide any information about whether Erin took a train or not. Therefore, this argument is not complete because it relies on an unjustified assumption.\n\nTherefore, the argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
