            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its validity based on the rules of inference. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This premise is a conditional statement, which means it has two parts: the antecedent (if part) and the consequent (then part). In this case, the antecedent is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and the consequent is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThe second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest. This premise is an independent statement that does not depend on any other premises or assumptions.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the griffin was not in the forest. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, as if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest (based on the conditional statement in the first premise), but since the unicorn was not in the forest, it follows that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement as its conclusion and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.",
