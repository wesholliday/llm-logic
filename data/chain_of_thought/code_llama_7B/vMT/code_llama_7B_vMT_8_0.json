            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its validity step by step.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the first premise.\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nThis premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. In fact, there are many instances where a vampire can be awake without the mummy being awake. Therefore, this premise does not logically follow from the given information.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the second premise.\nThe mummy was not awake.\nThis premise is a simple statement that is true by definition. The mummy is a fictional creature that is typically depicted as being inanimate and lifeless, so it cannot be awake or alive. Therefore, this premise logically follows from the given information.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe vampire was not awake.\nThis conclusion is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire would also be not awake. In fact, there are many instances where a vampire can be awake even if the mummy is not awake. Therefore, this conclusion does not logically follow from the given information.\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that the argument is not logically valid. The first premise does not logically follow from the given information, and the conclusion does not logically follow from either of the premises.",
