This premise is sound because it is based on a plausible assumption and is not contradictory.\n\nThe second premise \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is also a conditional statement that states that if one event occurs (Joe going to the park), then another event will not occur (Lucy going to the zoo). This premise is sound because it is based on a plausible assumption and is not contradictory.\n\nCompleteness:\nThe conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" is also a conditional statement that states that if one event occurs (Lucy not going to the zoo), then another event will not occur (Joe going to the park). This conclusion is complete because it is based on a plausible assumption and is not contradictory.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because both its soundness and completeness are met.",
