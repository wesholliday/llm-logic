This premise is true because it is a logical consequence of the fact that Lisa did buy the red shirt (assuming that she did not buy the blue shirt). Therefore, this argument is sound.\n\nCompleteness:\nThe second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, this premise does not logically follow from the first premise. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then it is possible that he bought a different shirt or did not buy any shirt at all. Therefore, this argument is incomplete.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because its second premise does not logically follow from the first premise.",
