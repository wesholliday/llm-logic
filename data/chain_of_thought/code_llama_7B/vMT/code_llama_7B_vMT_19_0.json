The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then).\n\nThe second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball. This premise is also a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then).\n\nThe conclusion states that Tom did not watch football. This conclusion is also a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of this argument based on the rules of inference. The first premise is logically valid because it is a conditional statement that is true if Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe second premise is also logically valid because it is a conditional statement that is true if Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nHowever, the conclusion is not logically valid because it is a conditional statement that is false if Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball. In this case, the conclusion is contradictory to both premises, which makes the argument invalid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
