            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its validity based on the rules of inference. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then).\n\nThe second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. This premise is also a conditional statement, but it is in the form of a negative conditional (if-not).\n\nThe conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball. This conclusion is also a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of this argument based on the rules of inference. The first premise is a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then). Therefore, we need to determine whether the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) logically implies the consequent (Amy played tennis).\n\nThe second premise is also a conditional statement, but it is in the form of a negative conditional (if-not). Therefore, we need to determine whether the antecedent (Amy did not play tennis) logically implies the consequent (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nSince the first premise is a material implication, we need to evaluate its validity based on the rules of material implication. The antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, and the consequent (Amy played tennis) is false. Therefore, the first premise is not logically valid.\n\nSince the second premise is also a material implication, we need to evaluate its validity based on the rules of material implication. The antecedent (Amy did not play tennis) is true, and the consequent (Jeff did not play basketball) is false. Therefore, the second premise is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because both premises are not logically valid.",
