            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its soundness and completeness.\n\nSoundness: The first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement that implies a logical consequence. If the antecedent (the condition) is true, then the consequent (the conclusion) must also be true. In this case, if the apple is red, it follows logically that the banana is yellow. Therefore, the first premise is sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"The banana was not yellow\" is a statement that contradicts the consequent of the first premise. If the banana is not yellow, then it cannot be the case that the apple was red, since the two statements are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the second premise is complete.\n\nConclusion: The conclusion \"The apple was not red\" is a statement that logically follows from both the first and second premises. If the banana is not yellow and the apple is not red, then it must be the case that the apple was not red. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
