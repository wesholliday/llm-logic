If Ben did not eat pasta, then the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"Kate did not eat salad\" is true regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not. However, if Ben did not eat pasta, then the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" does not follow from the premises. Therefore, this argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, the argument is neither sound nor complete, and it is therefore logically invalid.",
