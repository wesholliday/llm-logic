The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, this does not mean that the argument is invalid. It only means that we need to evaluate the validity of the second premise to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n2. The second premise states that the truck was not blue. This premise is a negative statement, and it is true if the truck was not blue. However, this does not mean that the argument is valid. It only means that we need to evaluate the validity of the first premise to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n3. The conclusion states that the car was not red. This conclusion is a negative statement, and it is true if the car was not red. However, this does not mean that the argument is valid. It only means that we need to evaluate the validity of both premises to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, we need to evaluate the validity of both premises to determine whether the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
