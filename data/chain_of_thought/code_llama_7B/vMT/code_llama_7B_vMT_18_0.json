The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This premise is a conditional statement, and it can be read as \"If the doll were plastic, then the truck would be metal.\"\n2. The second premise states that the truck was not metal. This premise is an affirmative statement.\n3. The conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This conclusion is also an affirmative statement.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of each step:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, and it can be read as \"If the doll were plastic, then the truck would be metal.\" This premise is logically valid because it is a well-formed conditional statement.\n2. The second premise is an affirmative statement, and it states that the truck was not metal. This premise is also logically valid because it is a well-formed affirmative statement.\n3. The conclusion is an affirmative statement, and it states that the doll was not plastic. This conclusion is logically valid because it is a well-formed affirmative statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
