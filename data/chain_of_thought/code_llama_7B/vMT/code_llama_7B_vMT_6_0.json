The if-clause states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the if-clause and the then-clause separately.\n\t+ If-clause: Is it true that Sue chose pizza?\n\t\t- No, because the argument states that Bob chose pasta instead of pizza.\n\t+ Then-clause: Is it true that Bob chose pasta?\n\t\t- Yes, because the argument states that Bob did not choose pasta.\n* Therefore, this premise is not logically valid because the if-clause is false and the then-clause is true.\n\nPremise 2: Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n* This premise is a simple statement that asserts that Bob did not choose pasta.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth.\n\t+ Is it true that Bob did not choose pasta?\n\t\t- Yes, because the argument states that Bob chose pizza instead of pasta.\n* Therefore, this premise is logically valid.\n\nConclusion: Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n* This conclusion follows from the first two premises. If the if-clause of the first premise is false (i.e., Sue did not choose pizza), then the then-clause of the first premise is also false (i.e., Bob did not choose pasta). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the validity of the first two premises.\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth.\n\t+ Is it true that Sue did not choose pizza?\n\t\t- Yes, because the argument states that Bob chose pasta instead of pizza.\n* Therefore, this conclusion is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
