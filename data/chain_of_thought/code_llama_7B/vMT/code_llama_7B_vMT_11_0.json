However, the second premise \"The muffins were not blueberry\" contradicts this implication. Therefore, the argument is unsound because it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The cake was not chocolate\" is based on the fact that the muffins are not blueberry, which is not explicitly stated in either premise. Therefore, the argument is incomplete because it does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
