If the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, in this argument, we are given the information that Sue was not at the wedding, which contradicts the conditional statement. Therefore, this argument is unsound because it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"Sue was not at the wedding\" is a necessary condition for the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" However, we are not given any information about Mary's attendance at the wedding. Therefore, this argument is incomplete because it does not provide sufficient evidence to support its conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is neither logically valid nor complete.",
