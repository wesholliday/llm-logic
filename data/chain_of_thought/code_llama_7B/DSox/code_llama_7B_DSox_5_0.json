The first premise states that the zinger is not smoogled, which means it cannot be both fraggled and smoogled at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled. This statement is a tautology, as it implies that the zinger must be one of these two things.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger is fraggled\" from the given premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
