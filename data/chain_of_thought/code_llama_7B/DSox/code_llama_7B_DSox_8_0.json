The first premise states that the sprocket is not daggled, while the second premise states that either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled. These two premises do not necessarily imply that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nFor example, suppose the sprocket is not daggled and it is also not cranked. In this case, the first premise would be true (the sprocket is not daggled), but the second premise would not be true (the sprocket is not cranked). Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket is cranked from these two premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer that the sprocket is cranked from 'The sprocket is not daggled' together with 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled'?\" is no.",
