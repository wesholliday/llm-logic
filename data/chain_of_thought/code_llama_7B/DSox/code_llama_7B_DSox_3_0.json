The first premise states that the splat is not quanked, which means it does not have the characteristic of being quanked.\n2. The second premise states that either the splat is morphed or it is quanked. This implies that the splat can be both morphed and quanked, but it cannot be neither morphed nor quanked.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed based on these two premises alone. The absence of a third premise that explicitly states the splat is morphed does not allow us to draw this conclusion.\n\n### Answer: No",
