The first premise states that the flugel is not zargled, which means it cannot be both blimmed and zargled at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled. This statement is true because if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n3. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from these two premises. The first premise states that the flugel is not zargled, which means it cannot be blimmed, and the second premise states that either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled, which means it must be zargled.\n\n### Answer: No",
