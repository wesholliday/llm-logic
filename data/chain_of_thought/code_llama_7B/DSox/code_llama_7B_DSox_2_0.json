The first premise states that the wug is not bimmed, which means it cannot be both flooped and bimmed at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed. This statement implies that the wug can only be one of these two things, but it does not necessarily mean that it is flooped.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug is flooped\" from these two premises. The wug could still be bimmed, even if it is not flooped.\n\n### Answer: No",
