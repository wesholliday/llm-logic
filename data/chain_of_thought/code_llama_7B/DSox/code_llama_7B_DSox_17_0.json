The first premise states that the flob is not movated. This means that the flob is in a state of rest, which is not necessarily related to whether it is skizzled or not.\n2. The second premise states that either the flob is skizzled or it is movated. This means that the flob could be in either a skizzled or movated state, but we don't know which one it is.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two premises. We need more information to make this inference.",
