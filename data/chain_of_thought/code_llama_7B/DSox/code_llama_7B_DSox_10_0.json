The first premise states that the wug is not garpled, which means it cannot be both sproonged and garpled at the same time.\n2. The second premise states that either the wug is sproonged or it is garpled. This statement is a tautology, as it simply restates what we already know about the wug's possible states.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug is sproonged\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given information.",
