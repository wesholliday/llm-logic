The first premise states that the fleeg is not surned, which means it is not surged.\n2. The second premise states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned. This means that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n4. However, this conclusion does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered. It could also be that the fleeg is not bluttered and is simply not surged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from \"The fleeg is not surned\" together with \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\"",
