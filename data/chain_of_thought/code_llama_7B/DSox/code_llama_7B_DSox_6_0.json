The first premise states that the grommet is not plopped, which means it is not in a state of being plopped.\n2. The second premise states that either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped. This statement implies that the grommet can be in one of two states: sploffed or plopped.\n3. The conclusion states that the grommet is sploffed. However, this conclusion cannot be logically inferred from the given premises because the first premise states that the grommet is not plopped, which means it cannot be in a state of being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from \"The grommet is not plopped\" together with \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped.\"",
