The first premise states that the flug is not zimmed, which means it is not in a state of being zimmed.\n2. The second premise states that either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed. This means that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n3. However, we know from the first premise that the flug is not zimmed, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flug is blummed\" from these two premises.",
