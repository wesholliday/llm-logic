The first statement, \"The smonk is not plagged,\" asserts that the smonk is not suffering from plaguedness.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged,\" states that either the smonk is suffering from vrebleness or it is suffering from plaguedness.\n3. If we assume that the smonk is not plagged, then it cannot be vrebled, because if it were vrebled, it would also be plagged.\n4. Therefore, we have a logical contradiction, because we have assumed that the smonk is not plagged and yet it is both vrebled and plagged.\n\nSo, we cannot infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from these two statements alone.",
