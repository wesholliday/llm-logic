The first premise states that the glip is not tragged, which means it does not have the characteristic of being tragged.\n2. The second premise states that either the glip is slogged or it is tragged. This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n3. However, we know from the first premise that the glip is not tragged, which means that it cannot be slogged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip is slogged based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The glip is slogged\" cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.",
