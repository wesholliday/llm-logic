The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not necessarily imply that Bob also chose pizza. It only means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nFor example, suppose Sue and Bob are both vegetarians and they both choose pasta as their dinner option. In this case, the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" would still be true, even though neither of them actually chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza based on the information provided.",
