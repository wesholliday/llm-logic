This statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would also be blueberry.\n2. The muffins were blueberry. This statement is an independent statement, which means it does not imply anything about the cake.\n\nNow, let's consider the information given in the question:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the cake was chocolate. This is because the first statement implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would also be blueberry. Since the second statement states that the muffins were blueberry, it follows that the cake must have been chocolate.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
