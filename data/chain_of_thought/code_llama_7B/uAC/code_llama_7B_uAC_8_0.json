The statement \"the mummy was awake\" does not necessarily mean that the vampire was also awake, as it is possible for a mummy to be awake without the vampire being awake. Additionally, the fact that both the vampire and the mummy were awake does not necessarily imply that they are in the same state of consciousness or that they are aware of each other's presence.",
