The statement \"the apple was red\" is not logically implied by the fact that the banana was yellow and the banana was yellow. This is because the two statements are independent of each other and do not contain any logical connections.\n\nHowever, if we were to add additional information, such as \"the apple was also yellow,\" then we could infer that the apple was red based on the fact that the banana was yellow. This is because the two statements \"the apple was red\" and \"the apple was also yellow\" are logically connected by a logical contradiction, which means that they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, if one statement is true, then the other statement must also be true.",
