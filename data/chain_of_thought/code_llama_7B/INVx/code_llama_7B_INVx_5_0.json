In this case, the condition is \"If the zinger was fraggled,\" and the action is \"then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the two clauses are logically consistent.\nThe two clauses are logically consistent because if the condition in the main clause is true (i.e., if the zinger was fraggled), then the action in the subordinate clause will also be true (i.e., the zinger was smoogled). Therefore, we can infer that \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
