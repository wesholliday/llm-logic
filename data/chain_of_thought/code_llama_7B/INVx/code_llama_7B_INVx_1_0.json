The first statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not logically follow that the negation of the antecedent implies the negation of the consequent. For example, if it rains, then the grass will be wet. However, if it doesn't rain, then the grass won't be wet. This does not mean that if it is not raining, then the grass is not wet.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" from \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"",
