The sentence \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" does not logically imply that if the grommet was not sploffed, then it did not plop the frink.\n\nThe reason for this is that the word \"then\" in the first sentence implies a causal relationship between the two events, but the word \"if\" in the second sentence does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. The second sentence could be interpreted as saying that if the grommet was not sploffed, then it did plop the frink, which is a different statement from what the first sentence implies.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second sentence from the first one.",
