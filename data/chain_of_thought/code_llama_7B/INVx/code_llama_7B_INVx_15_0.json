The first statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not logically follow that the second statement is also true.\n\nFor example, consider the following two statements:\n\n1. If it rains, then the grass will be wet.\n2. If it doesn't rain, then the grass will not be wet.\n\nThese two statements are both conditional sentences, but they do not logically follow from each other. The first statement is true if it rains, and the second statement is true if it does not rain. However, there may be cases where it does not rain but the grass is still wet (e.g., if the ground is covered with a layer of water that has nothing to do with the weather).\n\nIn the same way, the first statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended\" may be true even if the second statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spended\" is false. For example, imagine that the dreb was vroombed but not spent, and yet it still had a positive impact on the world. In this case, the first statement would be true, but the second statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spended\" from \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended\".",
