If the first clause is true, then the second clause must also be true, and if the second clause is false, then the first clause must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\n### Answer: Yes",
