It only implies that the splat was transformed in some way.\n\nFor example, if the splat was morphed into a different species or form, it is possible that it did not quack at all. The statement \"If the splat was not morphed\" does not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank.\"",
