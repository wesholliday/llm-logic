For example, if the wug was sproonged, it could have been garpled by someone else or it could have been left ungarpled.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\nIf I were to give you a book, then you would read it. This statement does not imply that if you did not receive the book, you would not read it. It only implies that if you received the book, you would read it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the first statement that if the wug was not sproonged, it was not garpled. We need more information to make such an inference.",
