The premise states that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked, but the conclusion states that if the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink. This means that the conclusion is a contradictory statement to the premise and therefore cannot be inferred from it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
