However, this does not necessarily mean that if the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\n\nFor example, let's say that the twonk was not plinked because it was not in the vicinity of a plinker. In this case, the twonk would not have been varnished even if it had been plinked. So, we cannot infer from the first statement that the twonk was not varnished if it was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is no.",
