However, this does not necessarily mean that if the smonk was not vreebled, then it was not plagged. There could be other factors at play that led to the smonk being plagged even if it was not vreebled.\n\nFor example, the smonk might have been plagged due to a different cause altogether, such as a nearby bird's chirping or a strong wind blowing through the trees. In this case, the fact that the smonk was not vreebled does not necessarily mean that it was not plagged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that if the smonk was not vreebled, then it was not plagged.",
