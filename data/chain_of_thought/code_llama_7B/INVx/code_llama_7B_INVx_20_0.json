The given statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not necessarily imply that the opposite of the condition is true. For example, if the fleeg was bluttered, it could still have not surned.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\nIf it rains, then the grass will be wet.\n\nThis statement does not imply that the grass will not be wet if it doesn't rain. It only implies that if it rains, then the grass will be wet.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn. We need more information to make such an inference.",
