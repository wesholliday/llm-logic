This does not necessarily mean that if the glip was not slogged, it was not tragged. There could be other factors at play that would make it impossible to determine whether the glip was tragged or not.\n\nFor example, we might have additional information about the glip that suggests it was not slogged, but it was still tragged due to some other factor. In this case, our inference would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that if the glip was not slogged, then it was not tragged.",
