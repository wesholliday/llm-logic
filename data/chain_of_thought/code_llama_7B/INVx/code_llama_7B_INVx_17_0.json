However, this does not necessarily mean that the flob was not skizzled and did not move. It could have been skizzled but not moved, or it could have been moved without being skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second sentence from the first one. The two sentences are independent of each other and do not logically follow from each other.",
