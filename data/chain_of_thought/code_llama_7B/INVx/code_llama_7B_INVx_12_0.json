However, this does not necessarily mean that if the ship was not dropped, it did not lift the zone. There could be other factors at play that prevented the ship from lifting the zone.\n\nFor example, the ship may have been damaged or unable to lift the zone due to a lack of resources or other constraints. In this case, even if the ship was not dropped, it would still not have lifted the zone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the ship was not dropped, it did not lift the zone based solely on the given statement.",
