The word \"then\" in the first sentence implies a causal relationship between the two events, but it does not necessarily imply that the second event is the logical opposite of the first. In other words, just because the wug was flooped and bimmed the zoint, it does not mean that it did not bim the zoint if it was not flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second sentence from the first one.",
