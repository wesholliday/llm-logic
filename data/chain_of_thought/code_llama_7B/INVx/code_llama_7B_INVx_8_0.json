The given statement is a conditional sentence, and it does not necessarily imply that the opposite of the condition is true. For example, if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled, but it does not mean that if the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nHere's a counterexample to disprove the inference:\n\nSuppose the sprocket was not cranked, and it was still daggled. In this case, the given statement is false, but the inference we are trying to make is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled from the given statement alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
