The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben did eat pasta, it would be reasonable to expect that Kate also ate salad.\n\nThe second premise states that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. This means that if Kate did eat salad, it would be reasonable to expect that Ben also ate pasta.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is simply a restatement of the first premise. If Ben ate pasta, then it would be reasonable to expect that Kate also ate salad, which is what the first premise states. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows from the premises in a straightforward and direct way.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
