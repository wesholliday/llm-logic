            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its premise and conclusion separately.\n\nPremise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n* This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the condition) and a then-clause (the consequence). In this case, the condition is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequence is \"Then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n* The premise is true if and only if both parts of the conditional statement are true. In other words, the premise is true if Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nConclusion: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n* This conclusion is also a conditional statement, with the same structure as the premise.\n* The conclusion is true if and only if both parts of the conditional statement are true. In other words, the conclusion is true if Mark bought the blue shirt and Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's evaluate whether the argument is logically valid or not. To do this, we need to determine whether the premise and conclusion are consistent with each other.\n\nConsistency means that the premise and conclusion must be true if the argument is true, and false if the argument is false. In other words, if the argument is true, then both parts of the conditional statement in the premise and conclusion must be true. If the argument is false, then at least one part of the conditional statement in the premise or conclusion must be false.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the premise and conclusion are consistent with each other if and only if both parts of the conditional statements are true. This means that the argument is logically valid if and only if Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n### Answer: Yes",
