In this case, the condition is \"If Mary was at the wedding,\" and the consequence is \"Then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n* The premise is true if and only if the condition is true and the consequence is true.\n\nConclusion: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\n* This conclusion is also a conditional statement, with the same structure as the premise.\n* To determine whether this conclusion logically follows from the premise, we need to evaluate whether the condition of the conclusion (i.e., \"If Sue was at the wedding\") is implied by the condition of the premise (i.e., \"If Mary was at the wedding\").\n\nIn this case, the condition of the conclusion (\"If Sue was at the wedding\") is not implied by the condition of the premise (\"If Mary was at the wedding\"), because it is possible for Sue to be at the wedding without Mary being there. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
