In this case, the if-clause is \"If the shirt was cotton,\" and the consequence is \"Then the pants were denim.\"\n* The if-clause states that the shirt was cotton. This statement is true because we are assuming that the shirt was indeed cotton.\n* The consequence states that the pants were denim. This statement is also true because we are assuming that the pants were indeed denim.\n\nPremise 2: If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\n* This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the part before the \"then\") and a consequence (the part after the \"then\"). In this case, the if-clause is \"If the pants were denim,\" and the consequence is \"Then the shirt was cotton.\"\n* The if-clause states that the pants were denim.
