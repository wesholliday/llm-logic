            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its premises and conclusion separately.\n\nPremise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\n* This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the part before the \"then\") and a consequence (the part after the \"then\"). In this case, the if-clause is \"If the apple was red,\" and the consequence is \"then the banana was yellow.\"\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of values for the variables in the argument and indicates whether each combination leads to a true or false conclusion.\n* In this case, the truth table for the first premise would look like this:\n\t+ If the apple was red: | Yes | No |\n\t+ Then the banana was yellow: | Yes | No |\n* Based on the truth table, we can see that both combinations lead to true conclusions. Therefore, the first premise is logically valid.\n\nConclusion: If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\n* This conclusion is also a conditional statement, with an if-clause (\"If the banana was yellow\") and a consequence (\"then the apple was red\").\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table.\n* In this case, the truth table for the second premise would look like this:\n\t+ If the banana was yellow: | Yes | No |\n\t+ Then the apple was red: | Yes | No |\n* Based on the truth table, we can see that both combinations lead to true conclusions. Therefore, the second premise is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument as a whole is logically valid because both of its premises are logically valid conditional statements.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
