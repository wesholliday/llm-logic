In this case, the if-clause is \"If the cake was chocolate,\" and the consequence is \"Then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n* This premise is logically valid because it is a tautology. A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values of its variables. In this case, the if-clause is always false (since cake and muffins are two different things), so the conclusion is also always true.\n\nPremise 2: If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement, with an if-clause \"If the muffins were blueberry\" and a consequence \"Then the cake was chocolate.\"\n* This premise is logically valid because it is a tautology. A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values of its variables. In this case, the if-clause is always false (since muffins and cake are two different things), so the conclusion is also always true.\n\nConclusion: If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement with an if-clause \"If the muffins were blueberry\" and a consequence \"Then the cake was chocolate.\"\n* This conclusion is logically valid because it is a tautology. A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values of its variables. In this case, the if-clause is always false (since muffins and cake are two different things), so the conclusion is also always true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because all of its premises are tautologies.",
