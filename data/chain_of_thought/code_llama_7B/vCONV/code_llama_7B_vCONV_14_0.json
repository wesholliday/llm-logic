            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its premises and conclusion separately.\n\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\n\n* This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause and a then-clause. The if-clause states that if the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of the variables in the argument and indicates whether each combination leads to a true or false conclusion.\n\n| Bear in case | Wolf in den | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | ? |\n| F | F | ? |\n\nIn this truth table, we can see that the conclusion is only true when both the if-clause and the then-clause are true. Therefore, the premise is logically valid if and only if the wolf was in the den whenever the bear was in the case.\n\nPremise 2: If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\n\n* This premise is also a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause and a then-clause. The if-clause states that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of the variables in the argument and indicates whether each combination leads to a true or false conclusion.\n\n| Wolf in den | Bear in case | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | ? |\n| F | T | ? |\n| F | F | ? |\n\nIn this truth table, we can see that the conclusion is only true when both the if-clause and the then-clause are true. Therefore, the premise is logically valid if and only if the bear was in the case whenever the wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument as a whole. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\" This conclusion follows from the premises \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den\" and \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of the variables in the argument and indicates whether each combination leads to a true or false conclusion.\n\n| Bear in case | Wolf in den | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | ? |\n| F | T | ? |\n| F | F | ? |\n\nIn this truth table, we can see that the conclusion is only true when both the if-clause and the then-clause are true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid if and only if the bear was in the case whenever the wolf was in the den.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
