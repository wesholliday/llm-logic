The if-clause states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table:\n\t+ If the vampire is awake and the mummy is awake, then the argument is true.\n\t+ If the vampire is awake and the mummy is not awake, then the argument is false.\n\t+ If the vampire is not awake and the mummy is awake, then the argument is false.\n\t+ If the vampire is not awake and the mummy is not awake, then the argument is true.\n* Based on the truth table, we can see that this premise is logically valid if and only if the antecedent (the vampire being awake) implies the consequent (the mummy being awake). In other words, if the vampire is awake, then it is likely that the mummy will also be awake.\n\nConclusion: If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\n* This conclusion is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the antecedent) and a then-clause (the consequent). The if-clause states that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must also be awake.\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth table:\n\t+ If the mummy is awake and the vampire is awake, then the argument is true.\n\t+ If the mummy is awake and the vampire is not awake, then the argument is false.\n\t+ If the mummy is not awake and the vampire is awake, then the argument is false.\n\t+ If the mummy is not awake and the vampire is not awake, then the argument is true.\n* Based on the truth table, we can see that this conclusion is logically valid if and only if the consequent (the vampire being awake) implies the antecedent (the mummy being awake). In other words, if the mummy is awake, then it is likely that the vampire will also be awake.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because both its premises and conclusion are logically valid conditional statements.",
