Modus ponens states that if a statement is true and its negation is false, then the original statement must be false.\n\nUsing modus ponens with the premises given, we can infer that:\nIf the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled. (Premise 1)\nIf the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled. (Modus ponens with Premise 1 and its negation)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\nIf the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled. (Conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
