In this case, the conclusion is a conditional statement (If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked), while the premise is also a conditional statement (If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\nBased on the analysis of the relationship between the premises and the conclusion, we can determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the premise is a conditional statement that states that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink. However, the conclusion is a conditional statement that states that if the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked. These two statements are not logically equivalent, and therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\nBased on the analysis of the relationship between the premises and the conclusion, we can determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. In this case, the argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
