The conclusion is a negation of the premise, which means that it is not necessarily true. For example, if the flugel was blimmed but not zargled, then the conclusion would be false.\n\nStep 3: Explain your reasoning in detail.\nThe given statement is an example of a logical fallacy known as a \"false dilemma.\" It is a type of argument that presents two mutually exclusive options and assumes that one of them must be true, when in fact both options could be false. In this case, the conclusion \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" is a negation of the premise, which means that it is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer this conclusion from the premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
