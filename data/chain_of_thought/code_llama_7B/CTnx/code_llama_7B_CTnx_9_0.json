They are not equivalent.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished. (Conditional statement)\n2. If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked. (Affirmative statement)\n3. The first statement implies that if the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished. This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it cannot be varnished.\n4. The second statement implies that if the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked. This means that if the twonk was varnished, then it cannot have been plinked.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked. The two statements are not equivalent.\n\n### Answer: No",
