The conclusion states that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case. However, the premise only states that if the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den. It does not necessarily imply that the wolf was in the den if the bear was not in the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\" from \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\"",
