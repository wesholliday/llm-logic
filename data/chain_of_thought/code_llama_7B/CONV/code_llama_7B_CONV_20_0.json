            "content": "\nStep 1: Evaluate the given premise.\nThe premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it implies that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the conclusion (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it implies that if the condition (the banana being yellow) is true, then the conclusion (the apple being red) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, we need to compare them and see if they have the same form. In this case, both statements are in the form of \"If A, then B.\" Therefore, they are logically equivalent.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are semantically equivalent.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion are semantically equivalent, we need to compare their meaning. In this case, both statements imply that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. Therefore, they are semantically equivalent.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are syntactically equivalent.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion are syntactically equivalent, we need to compare their structure. In this case, both statements have the same form, which is \"If A, then B.\" Therefore, they are syntactically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are logically entailed by each other.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion are logically entailed by each other, we need to evaluate their logical relationship. In this case, both statements imply that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. Therefore, they are logically entailed by each other.\n\nStep 7: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are semantically entailed by each other.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion are semantically entailed by each other, we need to evaluate their meaning relationship. In this case, both statements imply that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. Therefore, they are semantically entailed by each other.\n\nStep 8: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are syntactically entailed by each other.\nTo determine whether the premise and conclusion are syntactically entailed by each other, we need to evaluate their structure relationship. In this case, both statements have the same form, which is \"If A, then B.\" Therefore, they are syntactically entailed by each other.\n\nStep 9: Determine whether the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, semantically equivalent, syntactically equivalent, logically entailed by each other, semantically entailed by each other, or syntactically entailed by each other.\nBased on the evaluation of the premise and conclusion, we can determine that they are logically equivalent, semantically equivalent, syntactically equivalent, logically entailed by each other, semantically entailed by each other, and syntactically entailed by each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. The premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, semantically equivalent, syntactically equivalent, logically entailed by each other, semantically entailed by each other, and syntactically entailed by each other.",
