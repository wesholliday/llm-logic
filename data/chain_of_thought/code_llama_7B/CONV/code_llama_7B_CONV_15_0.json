The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" This is because the two statements are independent of each other and do not have any logical connection.\n\nFor example, suppose Sam took a plane to go to New York, but Erin took a train to go to Chicago. In this case, the first statement would be true (Sam did take a plane), but the second statement would be false (Erin did not take a plane).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" based on the fact that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"",
