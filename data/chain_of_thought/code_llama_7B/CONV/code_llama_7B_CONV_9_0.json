The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not necessarily imply that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It only implies that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nFor example, suppose Lisa did not buy the red shirt and Mark did buy the blue shirt. Then, the first statement is true (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), but the second statement is false (Mark did buy the blue shirt). In this case, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\".",
