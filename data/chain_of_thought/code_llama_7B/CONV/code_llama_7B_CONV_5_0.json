The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" This is because the first statement only provides a conditional relationship between Jeff and basketball, while the second statement requires a causal relationship between tennis and basketball.\n\nFor example, we could have a situation where Jeff played basketball but did not play tennis. In this case, the first statement would still be true, but the second statement would not be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" based solely on the fact that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"",
