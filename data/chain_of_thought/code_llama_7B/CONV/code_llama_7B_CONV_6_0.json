The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\" This is because the first statement only provides a conditional probability (i.e., the probability of one event given another), while the second statement requires a causal relationship between the two events.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob, who both like to eat pasta. If Alice chooses pasta, then it is likely that Bob also chose pasta, but there is no guarantee. Similarly, if Bob chooses pasta, it does not necessarily mean that Alice chose pasta as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one without additional information or assumptions.",
