            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer that. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" This is because the conditional statement \"then\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, but it does not guarantee that the second event will always follow from the first.\n\nFor example, suppose Tom and Jen are both fans of different sports, and they have different schedules. Tom might watch football on Sundays, while Jen watches basketball on Tuesdays. In this case, Tom did not watch football because Jen watched basketball, but rather the other way around. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
