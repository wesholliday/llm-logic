In this case, the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and therefore the conclusion \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is a tautology or not.\nThe argument is not a tautology because it uses a logical consequence rule to derive the conclusion from the premise. A tautology is an argument that is both valid and true, but does not use any logical rules to derive its conclusion. In this case, the argument is valid, but it does not follow from the premise alone.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is a syllogism or not.\nThe argument is not a syllogism because it uses only one premise and one conclusion, whereas a syllogism typically involves two premises and one conclusion. In this case, the argument is a simple logical consequence rule, which is not a syllogism.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses a logical consequence rule to derive its conclusion from the premise. Deductive arguments are based on logical rules and do not rely on empirical evidence or observation. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 6: Determine whether the argument is a categorical or non-categorical argument.\nThe argument is a categorical argument because it uses a logical consequence rule to derive its conclusion from the premise. Categorical arguments are based on general principles and do not rely on empirical evidence or observation. Non-categorical arguments, on the other hand, are based on specific instances and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 7: Determine whether the argument is a universal or particular argument.\nThe argument is a universal argument because it applies to all cases where the premise is true. Universal arguments are based on general principles and do not rely on empirical evidence or observation. Particular arguments, on the other hand, are based on specific instances and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 8: Determine whether the argument is a hypothetical or non-hypothetical argument.\nThe argument is a non-hypothetical argument because it does not involve any hypothetical situations. Hypothetical arguments are based on hypothetical situations and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 9: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or probabilistic argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses a logical consequence rule to derive its conclusion from the premise. Deductive arguments are based on logical rules and do not rely on empirical evidence or observation. Probabilistic arguments, on the other hand, are based on probability theory and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 10: Determine whether the argument is a causal or non-causal argument.\nThe argument is a non-causal argument because it does not involve any causal relationships between the premise and conclusion. Causal arguments are based on causal relationships and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 11: Determine whether the argument is a logical or non-logical argument.\nThe argument is a logical argument because it uses a logical consequence rule to derive its conclusion from the premise. Logical arguments are based on logical rules and do not rely on empirical evidence or observation. Non-logical arguments, on the other hand, are based on specific instances and make inferences about future events based on past observations.\n\nStep 12: Determine whether the argument is a formal or informal argument.\nThe argument is an informal argument because it does not use any formal logical rules to derive its conclusion from the premise. Formal arguments, on the other hand, are based on formal logical rules and do not rely on empirical evidence or observation.\n\nStep 13: Determine whether the argument is a persu",
