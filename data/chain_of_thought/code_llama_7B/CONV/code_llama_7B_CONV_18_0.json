            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer that. The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" does not logically imply \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" This is because the first statement only provides a condition for the second statement to be true, but it does not necessarily mean that the second statement will also be true.\n\nFor example, if we know that the doll was made of plastic and the truck was made of metal, then we can infer that the truck was metal because the doll was plastic. However, this does not mean that the opposite is also true. If the truck was made of plastic, it would not necessarily follow that the doll was made of metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"",
