The conclusion is also logically consistent because it is a conditional statement with a clear antecedent (the unicorn being in the forest) and consequent (the griffin being in the forest).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is deductively valid or inductively valid.\nThe argument is deductively valid because it follows from the premises to the conclusion using a logical inference, which is a deductive reasoning process.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the strength of the argument by determining its force and persuasiveness.\nThe argument has a strong force and persuasiveness because it is based on a logical inference that follows from the premises to the conclusion, which is a valid and consistent statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. The argument is deductively valid and has a strong force and persuasiveness.",
