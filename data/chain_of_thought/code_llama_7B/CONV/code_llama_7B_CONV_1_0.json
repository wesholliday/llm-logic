The premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This is because the first premise only states a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue, while the second premise states an unconditional relationship between Sue and Mary. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
