            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion of the given statement.\nPremise 1: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nConclusion: If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument by analyzing the premises and conclusion.\nThe argument is valid because both premises are true, and the conclusion logically follows from them. The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car was red, it is also possible that the truck was blue. The second premise states that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. This means that if the truck was blue, it is also possible that the car was red. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from both premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is a tautology or not.\nThe argument is not a tautology because it is based on two premises and a conclusion, and the conclusion logically follows from them. A tautology is an argument that is always true regardless of the premises. In this case, the argument is valid but not a tautology because it is based on specific premises and can be false if those premises are not met.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is a syllogism or not.\nThe argument is not a syllogism because it does not follow the standard form of a syllogism, which consists of two major premises and a minor premise leading to a conclusion. In this case, there is only one major premise and one minor premise, and the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion. Deductive arguments are based on specific premises and lead to a logical conclusion that is always true regardless of the premises. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and lead to a conclusion that may be false if the premises are not met.\n\nStep 6: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion. Deductive arguments are based on specific premises and lead to a logical conclusion that is always true regardless of the premises. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and lead to a conclusion that may be false if the premises are not met.\n\nStep 7: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion. Deductive arguments are based on specific premises and lead to a logical conclusion that is always true regardless of the premises. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and lead to a conclusion that may be false if the premises are not met.\n\nStep 8: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion. Deductive arguments are based on specific premises and lead to a logical conclusion that is always true regardless of the premises. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and lead to a conclusion that may be false if the premises are not met.\n\nStep 9: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion. Deductive arguments are based on specific premises and lead to a logical conclusion that is always true regardless of the premises. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and lead to a conclusion that may be false if the premises are not met.\n\nStep 10: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion. Deductive arguments are based on specific premises and lead to a logical conclusion that is always true regardless of the premises. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on general principles and lead to a conclusion that may be false if the premises are not met.\n\nStep 11: Determine whether the argument is a deductive or inductive argument.\nThe argument is a deductive argument because it uses logical reasoning",
