The first statement suggests that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, while the second statement implies that either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. This creates a logical contradiction, as both statements cannot be true at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
