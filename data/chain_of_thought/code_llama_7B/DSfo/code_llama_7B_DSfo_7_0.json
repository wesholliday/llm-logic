The first statement \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" does not provide any information about the location of the umbrella. The second statement \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it must be in the car. However, this does not necessarily mean that the umbrella is in the car, as there may be other possibilities such as it being in the garage or on the porch.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car based on the given information.",
