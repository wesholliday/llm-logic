The first statement \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack\" does not necessarily imply that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack. It only means that the scarf is not hanging on the coat rack, which could be due to various reasons such as it being folded or placed somewhere else.\n\nThe second statement \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" is a logical contradiction because it implies that the scarf can be both draped on the coat rack and stuffed in your backpack at the same time, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack from the information provided.",
