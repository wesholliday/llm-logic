The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" implies that the notebook is either in a different location or not present at all, but it does not provide any information about its current location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the notebook's current location based solely on these two statements. We would need additional information to make an inference about the notebook's location.",
