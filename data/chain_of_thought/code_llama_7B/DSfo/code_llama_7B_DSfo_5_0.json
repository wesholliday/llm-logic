The first statement implies that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, which means they must be somewhere else.\n2. The second statement states that either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, so it is possible that they are in the jar but not necessarily.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar based on these two statements alone.",
