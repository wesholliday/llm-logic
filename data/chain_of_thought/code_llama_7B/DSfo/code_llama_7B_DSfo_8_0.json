The statement \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" implies that the remote control is not located under the couch, which means it could be anywhere else in the room. The statement \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" does not provide any information about the location of the remote control, and therefore cannot be used to infer its location.\n\n### Answer: No",
