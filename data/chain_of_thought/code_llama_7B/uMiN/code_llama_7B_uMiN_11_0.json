This is because the statement \"the newspaper might not be in the driveway\" does not necessarily imply that it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nFor example, if we know that the newspaper is not in the driveway and we also know that it is not raining, then we can infer that it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway. However, this does not mean that it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway based on the fact that the newspaper might not be in the driveway.",
