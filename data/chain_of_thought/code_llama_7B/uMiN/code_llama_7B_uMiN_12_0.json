This is because the statement \"the jacket might not be draped over the chair\" implies that the jacket is not necessarily draped over the chair, which means that the hypothesis that the jacket must be draped over the chair is false. Therefore, we can conclude that it is not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
