This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This statement is a negation of the first premise, and it implies that the book cannot be resting on the table.\n3. The conclusion states that the book is on the shelf. This statement follows logically from the first two premises, as if the book must be resting on the table, then the second premise would be false, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the only possible interpretation of the premises is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
