This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This statement is a negation, which means that the opposite of the statement must be true.\n3. The conclusion states that the milk is on the counter. This statement is a simple statement, which means that it can be either true or false.\n4. Based on the premises and conclusion, we can deduce that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge (which is the case according to the second premise), then it must be on the counter (which is the case according to the first premise). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
