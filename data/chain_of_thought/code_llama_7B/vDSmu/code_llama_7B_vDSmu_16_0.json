This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This statement is a negation of the first premise, and it implies that the pen cannot be on my desk.\n3. The conclusion states that the pen is in my bag. This statement follows logically from the first two premises, as if the pen were on my desk, then the second premise would be false, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the only possible explanation for the pen being in my bag is that it must have been there all along.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
