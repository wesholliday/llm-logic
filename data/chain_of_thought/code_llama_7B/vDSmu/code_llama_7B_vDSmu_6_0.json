This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This statement is a negation, which means that the opposite of the statement must be true.\n3. The conclusion states that the phone is in the living room. This statement is a simple statement, which means that it can be either true or false.\n4. Based on the premises and conclusion, we can deduce that if the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
