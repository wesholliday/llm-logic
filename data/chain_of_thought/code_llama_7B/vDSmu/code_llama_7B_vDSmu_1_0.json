This means that if Fido is not inside, then it must be the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that if Fido must be in the garden, then it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n3. The conclusion is that Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not inside, then it must be the case that Fido must be in the garden, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
