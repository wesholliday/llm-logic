This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of these two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This statement is a negation of the first premise, and it implies that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor.\n3. The conclusion states that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. This statement follows logically from the first two premises, as if the missing puzzle piece were blending in on the floor, then the second premise would be false, and therefore the first premise would also be false. Therefore, if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
