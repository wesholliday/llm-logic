Therefore, this argument is not sound because it does not provide any new information or evidence to support its conclusion.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" is a contradiction, which means that it is always false regardless of the truth value of the first premise. Therefore, this argument is not complete because it does not provide any reason to reject its conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
