This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This statement is a negation of the first premise, and it implies that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n3. The conclusion states that the keys are in the drawer. This statement follows logically from the first two premises, as if the keys were not in the drawer, then they would have to be dangling in the cabinet, which is ruled out by the second premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the first two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
