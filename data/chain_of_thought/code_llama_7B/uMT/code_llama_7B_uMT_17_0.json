Kate did not eat salad.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate something else (salad). Therefore, if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat anything else either (since she did not eat salad).\n\nNow, from the second statement, we know that Kate did not eat salad. This means that she must have eaten something else (other than salad) if Ben ate pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
