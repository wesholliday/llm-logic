The statement \"the mummy was not awake\" does not necessarily imply that the vampire was awake, as it is possible for both the vampire and the mummy to be asleep. Additionally, the fact that the mummy was not awake does not rule out the possibility that the vampire could have been awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a conclusion about the vampire's state of being based on this information alone.",
