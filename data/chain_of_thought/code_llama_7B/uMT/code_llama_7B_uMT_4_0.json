This means that if the alien visited Mars, it is possible that the robot also visited Jupiter.\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the robot did not visit Jupiter, regardless of whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n3. We are given that the alien did not visit Mars. This means that the alien did not visit Mars, and therefore it is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
