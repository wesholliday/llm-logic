There could be other possible scenarios where Sue chose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Sue chose pizza but Bob chose something else entirely. Or, it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza at all and Bob chose pasta instead. Without more information, we cannot make any conclusions about what Sue or Bob actually chose.",
