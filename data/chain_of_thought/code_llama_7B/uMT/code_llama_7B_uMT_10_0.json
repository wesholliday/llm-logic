The cat was not outside.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the dog was not inside. This is because if the dog was inside, then the cat would have been outside (since the cat was not outside). However, since the cat was not outside, it follows that the dog must not have been inside either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
