The truck was not blue.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the car was not red. This is because if the car was red, then it would have been possible for the truck to be blue (since the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that the truck could be blue). However, since the truck was not blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
