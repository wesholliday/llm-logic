The statement \"Chris did not finish the race\" does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race. It is possible that Chris finished the race but did not place first, while Alex did finish the race and placed first.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (given statement).\n2. Chris did not finish the race (given statement).\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race (logical deduction).\n\n### Answer: No",
