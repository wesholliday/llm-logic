Therefore, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nNow, let's explain our reasoning:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Erin did not take a train.\n\nThe first statement is an implication, which means that if the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin taking a train) must also be true. The second statement states that Erin did not take a train.\n\nNow, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane because of the following:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Erin did not take a train.\n3. Therefore, if Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nThis is known as a logical deduction, where we can infer the truth of one statement based on the truth of another statement. In this case, we have used the first statement to imply that Erin took a train, and then used the second statement to contradict that inference. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
