The first premise states that \"it is not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This means that the possibility of the splat being quanked does not exist, and therefore, it cannot be inferred that the splat is morphed.\n2. The second premise states that \"either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This means that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. However, we have already established that the possibility of the splat being quanked does not exist, so this premise does not logically follow from the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from these two premises.",
