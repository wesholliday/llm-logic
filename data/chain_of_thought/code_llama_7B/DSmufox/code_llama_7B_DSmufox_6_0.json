The first premise, \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped,\" states that the opposite of the statement \"The grommet must be plopped\" is true. This means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed,\" states that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it is sploffed.\n3. The conclusion, \"The grommet is sploffed,\" states that the grommet is sploffed. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, but it does not necessarily follow that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" together with \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\"",
