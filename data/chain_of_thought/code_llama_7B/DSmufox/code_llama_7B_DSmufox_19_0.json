The first premise, \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged,\" states that the opposite of the statement \"The smonk must be plagged\" is true. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it is not the case that it must be plagged.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled,\" states that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This means that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n3. The conclusion, \"The smonk is vreebled,\" states that the smonk is actually vreebled. This conclusion cannot be drawn from the two premises alone, as they only state that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled, but do not provide any information about whether the smonk is actually plagged or vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged\" together with \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\"",
