This means that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nStep 4: From the first and second premises, we can infer that \"the flug is blummed\" because if the flug does not have to be zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The flug is blummed\" can be logically deduced from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
