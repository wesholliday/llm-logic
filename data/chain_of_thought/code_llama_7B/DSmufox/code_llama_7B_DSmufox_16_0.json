The first premise, \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted,\" states that the negation of the condition \"the sneg must be sproted\" is true. This means that the condition \"the sneg must be sproted\" is false, which implies that the sneg can be cramped.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled,\" states that either the sneg must be sproted or it is cramped. This means that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be cramped.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg is cramped\" from the first premise alone. We do not need to consider the second premise because the first premise already implies that the sneg is cramped.\n\n### Answer: No",
