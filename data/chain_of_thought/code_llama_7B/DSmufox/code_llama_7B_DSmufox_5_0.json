The first premise, \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled,\" states that the opposite of the statement \"the zinger must be smoogled\" is true. This means that if the zinger must be smoogled, then it cannot be fraggled.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled,\" states that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. This means that if the zinger must be smoogled, then it cannot be fraggled.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The zinger is fraggled\" is not logically entailed by the two premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
