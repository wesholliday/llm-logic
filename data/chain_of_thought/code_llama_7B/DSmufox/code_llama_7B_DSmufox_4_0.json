This suggests that the fribble may not be crinked, but it could also be snurgled.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"The fribble is snurgled\" from the given statements. The statements do not provide enough information to determine whether the fribble is snurgled or not.\n\n### Answer: No",
