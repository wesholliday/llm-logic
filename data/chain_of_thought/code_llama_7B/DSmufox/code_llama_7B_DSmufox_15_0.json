The first premise states that it is not the case that the dreb must be spent, which means that the possibility of spending the dreb does not exist.\n2. The second premise states that either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed. This means that if the dreb is not spent, then it must be vroombed.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the dreb is not spent, then it must be vroombed. However, this does not necessarily mean that the dreb is vroombed, as there may be other reasons why the dreb is not spent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from these two premises.",
