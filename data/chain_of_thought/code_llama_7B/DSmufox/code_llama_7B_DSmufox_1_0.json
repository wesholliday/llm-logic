The first premise, \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled,\" states that the negation of the condition for which the conclusion follows. In this case, the condition is \"the flugel must be zargled.\"\n2. The second premise, \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed,\" states that either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed. This means that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n3. The conclusion, \"The flugel is blimmed,\" states that the flugel is blimmed regardless of whether it is zargled or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" together with \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\"",
