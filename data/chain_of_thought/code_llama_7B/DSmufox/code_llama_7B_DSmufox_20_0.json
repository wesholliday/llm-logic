The first premise, \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned,\" states that the negation of the condition \"the fleeg must be surned\" is true. This means that the fleeg may or may not be surned, and we cannot conclude that it is bluttered based on this premise alone.\n2. The second premise, \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered,\" states that either the condition \"the fleeg must be surned\" or the condition \"the fleeg is bluttered\" is true. This means that we cannot conclude that the fleeg is bluttered based on this premise alone, as there may be other possibilities (such as the fleeg being neither surned nor bluttered).\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from these two premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
