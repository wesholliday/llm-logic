The first premise states that it is not the case that the flob must be moved. This means that the flob can be left in its current position, and there is no need to move it.\n2. The second premise states that either the flob must be moved or it is skizzled. This means that if the flob is not moved, it will be skizzled. However, we have already established that the flob can be left in its current position, so this premise does not apply in this case.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two premises. The first premise states that the flob is not movated, and the second premise only applies if the flob is movated. Since the flob can be left in its current position, it is not necessary to move it, so we cannot infer that it is skizzled.\n\n### Answer: No",
