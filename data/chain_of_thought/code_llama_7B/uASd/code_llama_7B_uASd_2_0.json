The bomb explosion could potentially cause harm or destruction to us and others around us, which would not be a positive experience. Additionally, the bombing could also disrupt the concert and cause it to end prematurely, which could be disappointing for those who were looking forward to attending the event.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if a bomb goes off while we are at the concert, we will have a good time. It is important to prioritize safety and avoid engaging in activities that could potentially put us or others at risk.",
