While exercise can help with weight loss, it is not the only factor that determines success. Eating a healthy diet and making sustainable lifestyle changes are also important for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Exercise alone does not provide enough calories to support weight loss. While exercise can help burn calories, it is not enough to make up for the excess calories consumed through junk food.\n2. Junk food is high in calories and low in nutrients. Eating junk food regularly can lead to a rapid increase in body fat, which can make it harder to lose weight even with regular exercise.\n3. Sustainable lifestyle changes are necessary for long-term weight loss. While exercise is important, it is not enough on its own. A healthy diet and making sustainable lifestyle changes, such as reducing stress and getting enough sleep, are also crucial for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nTherefore, while exercise can be a helpful tool in the pursuit of weight loss, it is not a guarantee that you will lose weight if you eat junk food regularly. It is important to make sustainable lifestyle changes and prioritize a healthy diet to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.",
