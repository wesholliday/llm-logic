The fact that the package has shipped does not necessarily mean that it will arrive on time or at all. It is possible that the package could be delayed due to various reasons such as bad weather, traffic congestion, or mechanical issues with the delivery vehicle. Additionally, even if the package was misrouted, it may still arrive on time if the carrier takes steps to rectify the situation and ensure a timely delivery. Therefore, we cannot make an inference about the arrival time of the package based solely on the fact that it has shipped.",
