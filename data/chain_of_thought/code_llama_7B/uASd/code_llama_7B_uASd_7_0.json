The pilot light is a separate appliance from the oven, and it is not necessary for the oven to be on in order for the kitchen to be warm. In fact, if the pilot light is out, the oven may still be able to heat the kitchen even though it is not turned on.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. This is because the oven is designed to heat the kitchen and maintain a consistent temperature.\n2. The pilot light is a separate appliance from the oven. It is not necessary for the oven to be on in order for the kitchen to be warm.\n3. If the pilot light is out, then the oven may still be able to heat the kitchen even though it is not turned on. This is because the pilot light is designed to provide a small amount of heat when the main heating source (such as gas or electricity) is not available.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.",
