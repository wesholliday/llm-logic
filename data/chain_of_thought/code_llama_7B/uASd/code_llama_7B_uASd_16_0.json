The reason for this is that fertilizing the lawn does not address the root cause of the drought, which is a lack of water. While fertilizer can provide nutrients to the grass, it cannot replace the need for water. Therefore, even if I fertilize the lawn during a drought, it may still not be lush and green.\n\n### Answer: No",
