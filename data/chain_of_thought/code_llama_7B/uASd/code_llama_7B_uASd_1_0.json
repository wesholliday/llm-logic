This is because the match is not a flammable substance and will not ignite even if it is soaked in water. The match is designed to produce a spark when it comes into contact with an ignition source, such as a flame or a spark. If the match is soaked in water, it will not be able to produce a spark, and therefore will not light.\n\n### Answer: No",
