This can be read as \"If A, then B\".\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nStep 4: Based on the first and second statements, we can infer that if the smonk is plagged, then it must be vreebled. However, we are also given that the smonk is not plagged. This means that the smonk cannot be plagged, which implies that it must be vreebled.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\n### Answer: Yes",
