The statement \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered\" implies that the fleeg is either surned or bluttered, but it does not provide any information about whether the fleeg is actually surned or bluttered.\n\nThe statement \"The fleeg is not surned\" provides a contradiction to the first statement, as if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered from this statement alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n### Answer: Yes",
