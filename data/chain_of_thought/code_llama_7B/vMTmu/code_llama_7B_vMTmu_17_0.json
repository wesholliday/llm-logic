This means that if Ben ate pasta, there would be a logical consequence that Kate must have eaten salad.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that there may be a situation where Kate did not eat salad, even if Ben ate pasta.\n3. The conclusion states that Ben did not eat pasta. This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate would not have had to eat salad.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it does not lead to a logical contradiction. If Ben did eat pasta and Kate did not eat salad, then the argument's conclusion would be false. However, if Ben did not eat pasta or Kate did eat salad, then the argument's conclusion would be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
