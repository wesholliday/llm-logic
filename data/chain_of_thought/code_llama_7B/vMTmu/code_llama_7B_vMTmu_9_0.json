            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that Mark must have bought the blue shirt just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt, regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n3. The conclusion states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is a direct statement about what we know to be true, and it does not necessarily imply anything about Mark's purchase of the blue shirt.\n4. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid because it does not rely on any false or contradictory statements. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, and there are no logical fallacies in the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
