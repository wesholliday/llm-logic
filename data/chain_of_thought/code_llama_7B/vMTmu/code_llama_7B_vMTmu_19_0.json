This premise is true because it is a logical consequence of the fact that Tom did watch football. Therefore, this argument is sound.\n\nCompleteness:\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. However, this premise does not logically follow from the first premise. In fact, it could be the case that Jen did watch basketball even if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, this argument is incomplete.\n\nTherefore, this argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
