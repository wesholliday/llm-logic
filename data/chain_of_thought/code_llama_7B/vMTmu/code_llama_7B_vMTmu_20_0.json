            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is false.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This is a negative statement, which means that it is true if the antecedent is false.\n3. The conclusion states that the apple was not red. This is also a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is false and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is true.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from both premises. If the first premise is true (i.e., the apple was red), then the second premise must be false (i.e., the banana cannot have been yellow). This means that the conclusion (the apple was not red) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this argument is logically valid.",
