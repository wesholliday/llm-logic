The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. In fact, there could be many other possible explanations for why Erin did not take a train. Therefore, this premise does not logically follow from the information given.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This premise is a negative statement, and it is not necessarily true that Erin must have taken a train. In fact, there could be many other possible explanations for why Erin did not take a train. Therefore, this premise does not logically follow from the information given.\n3. The conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane. This conclusion is based on the first premise and the second premise, but it is not necessarily true. There could be many other possible explanations for why Sam did not take a plane, such as he may have taken a bus or a car. Therefore, this conclusion does not logically follow from the information given.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because the first premise and the second premise do not logically follow from the information given, and the conclusion does not logically follow from the first premise and the second premise.",
