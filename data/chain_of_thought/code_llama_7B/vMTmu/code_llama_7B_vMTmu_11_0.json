This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that the muffins must have been blueberry just because the cake was chocolate.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the muffins could have been any flavor, including but not limited to blueberry.\n3. The conclusion states that the cake was not chocolate. This is a statement about the cake, and it does not necessarily imply anything about the muffins.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it does not rely on any false or contradictory statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
