This means that if the doll is plastic, it follows that the truck must be metal.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the assumption that the truck must have been metal is false.\n3. The conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This means that if the first premise is true, then the conclusion follows. However, if the second premise is also true, then the first premise is false, and the conclusion does not follow.\n4. Therefore, this argument is logically valid if and only if the first premise is true and the second premise is false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
