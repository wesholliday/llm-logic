The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. For example, the vampire could be asleep while the mummy is awake.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This premise is a negative statement, and it is not necessarily true that the mummy must have been awake. For example, the mummy could be asleep while the vampire is awake.\n3. The conclusion states that the vampire was not awake. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, but it does not follow logically from the second premise. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
