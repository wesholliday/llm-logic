            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. In fact, there could be other factors that prevented Sue from being at the wedding.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a negative statement, and it implies that Sue was not required to be at the wedding.\n3. The conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. This is a negative statement, and it implies that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows from the premises to the conclusion. However, this does not necessarily mean that the argument is true or that the conclusion is necessarily true. It could be that Sue was not at the wedding for other reasons, and Mary was still present.\n\nAnswer: No",
