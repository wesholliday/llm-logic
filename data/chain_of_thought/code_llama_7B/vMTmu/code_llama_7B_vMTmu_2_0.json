            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its soundness and completeness.\n\nSoundness: The first premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a conditional statement that states that if one thing happens (the griffin being in the forest), then another thing must happen (the unicorn being in the forest). This premise is sound because it is based on a reasonable assumption about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn. However, the second premise \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is an affirmative statement that asserts that the opposite of the conditional statement is true. This premise is not sound because it is based on a false assumption about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" is also an affirmative statement, which means that it is not complete. A complete argument must have both a premise and a conclusion that are affirmative statements. Therefore, this argument is not complete because it only has one affirmative conclusion.\n\nBased on the soundness and completeness analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid.",
