This means that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must also have finished the race.\n2. The second premise states that it is not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris may or may not have finished the race.\n3. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race. This means that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must have finished the race, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
