The first premise states that studying hard will help you pass the test, which is a general statement about the relationship between studying hard and passing the test. The second premise states that the test is in Chinese, which is a specific fact about the test. By combining these two premises, we can conclude that if you study hard and the test is in Chinese, you will pass the test. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
