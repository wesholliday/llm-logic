The first premise states that getting enough sleep will prevent fatigue, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between sleep and hard labor. Therefore, we cannot conclude that doing hard labor will also prevent fatigue based solely on the first premise.\n\nIn fact, there are many factors that can contribute to fatigue, such as physical exertion, mental stress, and lack of rest. The second premise does not provide any information about these factors or how they relate to hard labor. Therefore, we cannot conclude that doing hard labor will prevent fatigue based solely on the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on insufficient premises to support its conclusion.",
