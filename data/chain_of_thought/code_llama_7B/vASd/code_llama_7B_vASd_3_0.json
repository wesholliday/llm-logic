The first premise states that if the car is in the garage, then it is safe. This means that if the car is in the garage, there is a possibility that it is safe. The second premise states that if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe. This means that if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, there is a higher probability that it is safe. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
