The first premise states that if you charge your phone, it will have power. The second premise states that if you charge your phone and it has a dead battery, it will still have power. Therefore, the conclusion that if you charge your phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power is logically valid because it follows from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
