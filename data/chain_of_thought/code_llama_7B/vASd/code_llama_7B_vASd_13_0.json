The second premise implies that exercising and eating junk food will lead to weight loss, but it does not necessarily follow that simply exercising will also lead to weight loss. In other words, the second premise provides additional information about the relationship between exercise and weight loss, but it does not establish a causal link between exercise and weight loss in general.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.",
