The first premise states that filling up the gas tank will make the car run, but it does not specify under what conditions this will happen. The second premise adds an additional condition to the first premise by stating that there must be a hole in the car for it to run. However, this additional condition is not mentioned in the first premise, and therefore it is not implied by it. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
