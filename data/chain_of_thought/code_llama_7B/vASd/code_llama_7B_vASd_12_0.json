The first premise states that if you finish your homework, you can play video games. The second premise states that if your computer catches on fire, you can play video games. The conclusion states that if you finish your homework and your computer catches on fire, you can play video games.\n\nThe argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. It does not matter whether or not the second premise is true, as long as it is possible for a computer to catch on fire. The first premise ensures that if you finish your homework, you can play video games, regardless of whether or not your computer catches on fire. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
