The first premise states that if an order is placed, then the item will ship. This means that if an order is placed, there is a high probability that the item will ship.\n\nThe second premise states that if an order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship. This means that if an order is placed and the item is out of stock, there is also a high probability that the item will ship.\n\nThe conclusion states that if an order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship. This conclusion follows logically from the premises because if both conditions are true (i.e., an order is placed and the item is out of stock), then there is a high probability that the item will ship.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because its conclusion logically follows from its premises.",
