The first premise states that if we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time. However, the second premise states that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. This means that the second premise is not a necessary condition for the first premise. In other words, just because we go to the concert does not mean that a bomb will go off, so the first premise may not be true in all cases.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
