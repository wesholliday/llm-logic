The first premise states that if you water the plants, they will grow. The second premise states that if there is no sunlight, the plants will not grow. The conclusion states that if you water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will still grow. This is because the first premise provides a necessary condition for the plants to grow, while the second premise provides an additional condition that must be met in order for the plants to grow.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows from its premises and conclusion.",
