The first premise states that if you change the oil in a car, it will run smoothly. The second premise adds an additional condition to this statement by stating that if you also change the transmission while changing the oil, the car will still run smoothly. The conclusion simply restates this additional condition as a general rule, which is consistent with the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical sequence of reasoning from the premises to the conclusion.",
