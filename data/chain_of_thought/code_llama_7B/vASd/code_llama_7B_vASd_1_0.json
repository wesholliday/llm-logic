The first premise states that if a match is struck, it will light. The second premise adds an additional condition to this statement by stating that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will still light. This means that the second premise strengthens the conclusion of the argument, which was already valid based on the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
