The first premise states that if the package has shipped, then it will arrive today. This means that if the package has shipped, there is a high probability that it will arrive today.\n\nThe second premise states that if the package was misrouted, then it will arrive today. This means that if the package was misrouted, there is still a high probability that it will arrive today.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument states that if the package was misrouted and it has shipped, then it will arrive today. This conclusion follows logically from the premises because if the package was misrouted and it has shipped, then it is likely to arrive today regardless of whether it was misrouted or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.",
