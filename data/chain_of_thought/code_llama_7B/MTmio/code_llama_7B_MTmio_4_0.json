The first statement suggests that the robot might not have visited Jupiter, while the second statement implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nFor example, the robot could have visited Jupiter but not Mars, or it could have visited both planets but not in that order. The second statement only provides a necessary condition for the robot to have visited Jupiter if the alien visited Mars, but it does not rule out other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on these two statements alone.",
