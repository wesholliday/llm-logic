The first statement only implies that the pants were not denim, while the second statement only implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. It does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nFor example, let's say we know that the pants were made of denim and the shirt was also made of cotton. Then, based on the two statements, we can infer that the pants were not denim and the shirt was not cotton. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the two statements alone.",
