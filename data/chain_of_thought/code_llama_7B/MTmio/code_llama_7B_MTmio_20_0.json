This means that we cannot assume that the banana is yellow without further evidence.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This means that if the apple is red, then it is likely that the banana is also yellow.\n\nStep 4: We are asked to infer whether \"The apple was not red\".\n\nStep 5: Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the apple was not red. The first statement implies that the banana might not have been yellow, which means that we cannot assume that the apple is red without further evidence. The second statement states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" based on the two statements provided.",
