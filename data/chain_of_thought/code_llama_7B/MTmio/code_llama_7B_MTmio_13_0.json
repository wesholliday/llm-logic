This means that it is possible for the truck to be any color other than blue.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car is red, then the truck must also be blue.\n\nStep 4: We are asked whether we can infer \"The car was not red\" from these two statements.\n\nStep 5: Based on the information provided, it is possible for both the car and the truck to be any color other than red. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based solely on the information given.\n\n### Answer: No",
