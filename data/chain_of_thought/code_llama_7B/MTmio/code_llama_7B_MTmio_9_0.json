            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements:\n\n1. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 2: We want to infer whether or not Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 3: To infer this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement suggests that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, while the second statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Based on these statements, it is possible to infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then he could not have bought the red shirt either, since the second statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark must not have bought the blue shirt either.\n\nStep 5: However, it is also possible to infer that Lisa did buy the red shirt. This is because the first statement does not necessarily imply that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It only suggests that he might not have bought it. Therefore, if Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we can still infer that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 6: In conclusion, based on the two statements given, it is possible to infer both that Lisa did not buy the red shirt and that she did buy the red shirt. Therefore, the answer is \"no\" because there is no definitive answer to this question.",
