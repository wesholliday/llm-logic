The statement \"The truck might not have been metal\" does not provide any information about the doll's material. It only provides a possibility that the truck was not made of metal. Similarly, the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" does not imply that the doll was not plastic. It only implies that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
