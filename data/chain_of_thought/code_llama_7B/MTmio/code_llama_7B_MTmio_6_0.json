The statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. It only means that Bob may not have chosen pasta, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that Sue chose pizza.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" - This statement implies that Bob has the option to choose either pasta or not choose pasta.\n2. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" - This statement is a conditional statement that states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. It does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information.",
