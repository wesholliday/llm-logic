The first statement suggests that the mummy might not have been awake, but it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake. It could be that the mummy was asleep while the vampire was awake.\n2. The second statement implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake. It could be that the vampire was awake while the mummy was asleep.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the vampire's state of being.",
