The first statement only implies that Sue might not have been at the wedding, while the second statement states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This creates a logical contradiction, as it is possible for Mary to be at the wedding and Sue not to be there. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these two statements alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
