This means that we cannot conclude that the muffins were definitely blueberry based on this statement alone.\n\nStep 3: The second statement states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This implies that the muffins were blueberry if the cake was chocolate.\n\nStep 4: We are given no information about the cake's flavor, so we cannot conclude that it was chocolate based on this statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the two statements provided. ### Answer: No",
