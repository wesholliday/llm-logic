This is because the statement \"If Sam took a plane\" does not logically imply that Sam also took a train. It is possible for Sam to have taken a plane and not taken a train, or for Sam to have not taken a plane and taken a train. Therefore, we cannot make a general inference about Erin's mode of transportation based on the fact that Sam took a plane.\n\n### Answer: No",
