The question asks whether we can infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n3. To answer this question, we need to consider what happens when the bear is not in the cave. If the bear is not in the cave, then it means that the wolf is not in the den either. This is because if the bear were in the cave, then the wolf would also be in the den (as stated in step 1).\n4. Therefore, if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
