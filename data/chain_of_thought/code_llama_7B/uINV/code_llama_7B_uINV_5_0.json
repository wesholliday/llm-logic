This is because there are other possible explanations for why Amy might have played tennis, such as she might have been playing tennis on her own or with a friend, or she might have been practicing for a tournament.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Given premise)\n2. Jeff did not play basketball. (Assumption)\n3. Therefore, Amy did not play tennis. (Inference)\n\nHowever, this inference is not necessarily true.
