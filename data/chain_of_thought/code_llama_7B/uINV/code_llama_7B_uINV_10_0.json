This is because there are other possible explanations for why the dog was not inside, such as it being a rainy day and the dog not wanting to go outside, or it being a busy day and the dog having other responsibilities.\n\nHowever, if we know that the dog was not inside, then we can infer that the cat was likely outside, based on the assumption that the dog and cat are both animals and they have similar habits and behaviors.",
