If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. (Inference)\n\nThe first statement is a fact, while the second statement is an inference based on the given premise. The inference states that if one person was not at the wedding, then the other person was also not at the wedding. This inference is valid because it is based on the assumption that Mary and Sue are related in some way (e.g., they are siblings or friends).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. The answer to the question is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
