The cake was not chocolate.\n3. Therefore, the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThis argument is based on a conditional statement, which states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, we are given that the cake was not chocolate, so it is possible that the muffins could have been any flavor. Therefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry based on this argument alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
