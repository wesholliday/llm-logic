This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the conclusion (Lucy went to the zoo) depends on the premise (Joe went to the park). However, just because Joe did not go to the park does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. There could be other factors at play, such as a change in plans or a different route taken by Lucy.\n\n### Answer: No",
