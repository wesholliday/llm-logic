(This is the conclusion we want to draw.)\n\nStep 3: Therefore, if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. (This is our inference based on the premise and conclusion.)\n\nReasoning: We can infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad because the two events are correlated. If Ben ate pasta, then it is likely that Kate ate salad as well. However, if Ben did not eat pasta, then it is unlikely that Kate ate salad. Therefore, we can infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
