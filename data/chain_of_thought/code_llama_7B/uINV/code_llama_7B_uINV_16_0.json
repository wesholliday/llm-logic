Therefore, the pants were not denim.\n\nThis argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that if the premise (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the conclusion (the pants were denim) must also be true. However, we have established that the premise is false, so the conclusion cannot be logically inferred.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
