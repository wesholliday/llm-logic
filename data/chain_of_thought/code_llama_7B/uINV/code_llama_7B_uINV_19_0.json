The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" does not necessarily imply that Tom watching football is a necessary condition for Jen watching basketball. There could be other factors at play that cause Jen to watch basketball, even if Tom did not watch football. For example, Jen might have always been interested in basketball and started watching it on her own, regardless of whether or not Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. We need more information to make a conclusion about this statement.",
