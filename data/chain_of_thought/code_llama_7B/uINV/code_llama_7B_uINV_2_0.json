The griffin is a mythical creature that lives in forests.\n3. The unicorn is also a mythical creature that lives in forests.\n4. Therefore, if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. (Inference)\n\nThis inference is based on the assumption that the griffin and the unicorn are both mythical creatures that live in forests. If the griffin is not in the forest, it means that it has left or been removed from the forest, which implies that the unicorn was also not in the forest.\n\n### Answer:\n\nYes",
