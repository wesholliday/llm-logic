The alien did not visit Mars.\n3. Therefore, the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThis argument is based on a conditional statement, where we assume that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. We also know that the alien did not visit Mars, which means that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This conclusion follows logically from the given premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
