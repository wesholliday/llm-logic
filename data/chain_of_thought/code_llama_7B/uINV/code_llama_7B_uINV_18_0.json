In this case, we can infer that the truck must also be metal, since the statement \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
