The first premise states that it is not the case that the glip must have tragged. This means that there is no necessary connection between the glip being slogged and its having tragged.\n2. The second premise states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. This means that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged, regardless of whether or not it had to.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the glip may have been slogged and still not have tragged.\n\n### Answer: No",
