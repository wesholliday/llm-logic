If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nStep 3: We can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nReasoning:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that it is not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. This means that the whiffle did not tink when it was shanked. Therefore, if the whiffle was shanked, then it must not have tinked. But from premise 2, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. This is a contradiction, so we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
