If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spent.\n\nStep 2: We can infer the following conclusion from these premises:\n\n3. The dreb was not vroombed.\n\nReasoning:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that it is not the case that the dreb must have been spent. This means that the dreb has not been spent, and therefore it cannot be the case that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spent. This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb has been spent.\n\nTherefore, from these two premises, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
