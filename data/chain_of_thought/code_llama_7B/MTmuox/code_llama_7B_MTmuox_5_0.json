If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nStep 2: We can infer the following conclusion:\n\n3. The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nReasoning:\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that it is not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that the zinger cannot have been smoogled.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that if the zinger was fraggled, it would have been smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled, since it cannot have been fraggled and still be unsmoogled.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
