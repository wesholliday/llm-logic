The first premise states that it is not the case that the flob must have moved. This means that there is no reason to assume that the flob did move.\n2. The second premise states that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved. This means that if the flob was skizzled, it would be reasonable to infer that the flob did move.\n3. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"The flob was not skizzled\" based on these two premises alone. We need additional information or evidence to support this conclusion.",
