The first premise states that it is not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This means that the wug did not bim the zoint, but we don't know whether it was flooped or not.\n2. The second premise states that if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This means that if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint, but we don't know whether the wug was flooped or not.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from these two premises. We only know that the wug did not bim the zoint and that if it was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint.",
