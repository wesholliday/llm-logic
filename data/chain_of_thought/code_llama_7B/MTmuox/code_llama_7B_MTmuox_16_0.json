The first premise states that it is not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that there is no reason to assume that the sneg was cramped.\n2. The second premise states that if the sneg was cramped, then the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that if the sneg was cramped, it would be reasonable to infer that it did in fact sprot the frink.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg was not cramped\" from \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" together with \"If the sneg was cramped, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\"\n\n### Answer: No",
