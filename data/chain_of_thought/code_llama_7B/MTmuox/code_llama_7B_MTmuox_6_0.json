The first statement is a hypothetical scenario in which the grommet plopped the frink, while the second statement is a conditional statement that implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. These two statements do not necessarily imply that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nFor example, suppose we know that the grommet was sploffed and that it did not plopp the frink. In this case, the first statement would still be true (the grommet plopped the frink), but the second statement would not be true (if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink). Therefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed from these two statements.\n\n### Answer: No",
