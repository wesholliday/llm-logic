The first premise states that it is not the case that the twonk must have been varnished. This means that there is no necessary connection between the twonk being varnished and its being plinked.\n2. The second premise states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished, regardless of whether or not it was actually varnished beforehand.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the twonk was plinked in the first place!\n\n### Answer: No",
