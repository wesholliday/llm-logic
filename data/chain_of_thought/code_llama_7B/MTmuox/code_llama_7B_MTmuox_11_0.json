The first premise states that it is not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the flug was zimmed.\n2. The second premise states that if the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed. This means that if the flug was blummed (i.e., it was somehow altered), then it must have been zimmed (i.e., it was somehow changed).\n3. The conclusion states that \"The flug was not blummed.\" This means that the flug was not altered in any way, and therefore it cannot be inferred that it was zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed\" together with \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\"",
