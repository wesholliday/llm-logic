The first premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that there is no necessary connection between the sprocket being daggled and its being cranked.\n2. The second premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then there is a necessary connection between the sprocket being cranked and its being daggled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that it is possible for the sprocket to have been cranked without also being daggled.\n\n### Answer: No",
