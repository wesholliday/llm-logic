The first premise states that it is not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This means that there is no necessary connection between the clug being snugged and the fact that the clug was fleeked.\n2. The second premise states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This means that if the clug was fleeked, then there is a necessary connection between the clug being fleeked and the fact that the clug was snugged.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can only conclude that it is possible for the clug to have been fleeked without necessarily being snugged.\n\n### Answer: No",
