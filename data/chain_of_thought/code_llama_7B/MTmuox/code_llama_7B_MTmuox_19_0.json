The first premise states that it is not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that the smonk did not plagiarize anything.\n2. The second premise states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. This means that if the smonk was vreebled (i.e., it had a certain characteristic), then it would be expected that the smonk would have plagiarized something.\n3. The conclusion states that we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from these two premises. This means that we cannot conclude that the smonk was not vreebled based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\" together with \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\"",
