The first premise states that it is not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This means that there is no necessary connection between the flugel being blimmed and its having to be zargled.\n2. The second premise states that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it would necessarily have been zargled.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from these two premises. In fact, we can conclude that the flugel could have been blimmed and still not have been zargled.\n\n### Answer: No",
