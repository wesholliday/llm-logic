The first premise states that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. This means that there is no necessary connection between the fleeg being bluttered and it having been surned.\n2. The second premise states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned, regardless of whether or not it actually was bluttered.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the fleeg was ever bluttered. All we know is that if it was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\n### Answer: No",
