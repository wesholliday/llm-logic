The first premise states that it is not the case that the shank must have been nugged. This means that there is no necessary connection between the shank being nugged and its being plooked.\n2. The second premise states that if the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged. This means that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shank was not plooked.\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these two premises. In fact, we can't even be sure that the shank was plooked at all!\n\n### Answer: No",
