The first premise states that it is not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that the smip did not necessarily luup the zoint.\n2. The second premise states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip was shripped, it would be logically necessary for the smip to have lupped the zoint.\n3. However, we are not given any information about whether the smip was shripped or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the smip was not shripped based on these two premises alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\" together with \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"",
