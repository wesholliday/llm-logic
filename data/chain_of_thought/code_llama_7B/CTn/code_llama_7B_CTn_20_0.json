            "content": "\nStep 1: Analyze the given premise.\nThe premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is not yellow. This means that if the apple is red, it does not necessarily follow that the banana is yellow. It could be that the banana is yellow and the apple is red, or it could be that the banana is not yellow and the apple is not red.\n\nStep 2: Consider the possibility of a counterexample.\nLet's consider a situation where the apple is red and the banana is yellow. In this case, the premise would be true, but the conclusion would not be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is not valid because it relies on a false assumption. The premise assumes that the apple and banana are related in some way, but this relationship is not explicitly stated or demonstrated. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\n### Answer: No",
