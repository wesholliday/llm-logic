The conclusion is also logically consistent because it is also a conditional statement with a clear antecedent (Sue being at the wedding) and consequent (Mary not being at the wedding).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\nThe argument is valid because the premises are logically consistent and the conclusion follows from them.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.",
