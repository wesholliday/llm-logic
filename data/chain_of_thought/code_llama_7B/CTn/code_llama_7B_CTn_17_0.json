The premise \"If Ben ate pasta\" is not sufficient to determine whether Kate ate the salad or not. It only establishes that Ben did eat pasta, but it does not provide any information about whether Kate also ate the salad. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premises.\n\n### Answer: No",
