For example, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim, but this does not mean that the pants were denim if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate:\n\nSuppose the shirt was cotton and the pants were denim. Then, the first statement is true (the shirt was cotton), but the second statement is false (the pants were denim). So, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nHowever, if we know that the shirt was not cotton, then we can infer that the pants were denim. This is because the first statement is false (the shirt was not cotton), and therefore the second statement must be true (the pants were denim).",
