The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" implies that the car being red is a necessary condition for the truck not being blue, but it does not imply that the opposite is also true. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from the premise alone.\n\n### Answer: No",
