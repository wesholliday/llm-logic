The conclusion states that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. However, the premise only states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. It does not necessarily imply that the wolf was in the den if the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premises. The two statements are independent of each other and do not logically follow from one another.",
