In other words, just because the first statement is true, it does not mean that the second statement must also be true.\n\nFor example, if I say \"If it rains, then my shirt will get wet,\" it does not mean that if my shirt is not wet, then it did not rain. The two statements are related but not necessarily equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.",
