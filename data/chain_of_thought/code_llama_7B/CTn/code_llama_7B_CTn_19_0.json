            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer that. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" This is because the conditional statement \"then\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, but it does not guarantee that the second event will always follow from the first.\n\nFor example, suppose Tom and Jen are both fans of different sports, and they have different schedules. Tom might watch football on Sundays, while Jen watches basketball on Tuesdays. In this case, Tom did not watch football on Sunday, but Jen did watch basketball on Tuesday. Therefore, the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" is false, even though Jen did watch basketball on that day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"",
