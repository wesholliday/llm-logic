It only implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFor example, suppose the alien visited Mars and the robot also visited Jupiter. In this case, the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" would still be true, even though the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.",
