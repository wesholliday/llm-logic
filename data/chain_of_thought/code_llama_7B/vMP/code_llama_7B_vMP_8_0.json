The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. However, we can assume that this is a reasonable assumption for the purposes of this argument.\n2. The second premise states that the vampire was awake. This premise is a factual statement, and it is true based on our current understanding of the situation.\n3. The conclusion states that the mummy was awake. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, since if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
