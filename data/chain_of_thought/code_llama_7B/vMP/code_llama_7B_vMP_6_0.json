The if-clause states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the antecedent and the validity of the consequent.\n\t+ Antecedent: If Sue chose pizza.\n\t+ Consequent: Bob chose pasta.\n* The antecedent is a statement about Sue's choice, so it must be true in order for the premise to be logically valid. However, we are not given any information about Sue's choice, so we cannot determine whether this statement is true or false. Therefore, the premise is not logically valid.\n\nPremise 2: Sue chose pizza.\n\n* This premise is a simple statement that states that Sue chose pizza.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate its truth. We are given information about Sue's choice, so we can determine whether this statement is true or false.\n* The premise is logically valid because it is based on a factual statement that is true.\n\nConclusion: Bob chose pasta.\n\n* This conclusion is also a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts: an if-clause (the antecedent) and a then-clause (the consequent). The if-clause states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n* To determine whether this conclusion is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the antecedent and the validity of the consequent.\n\t+ Antecedent: If Sue chose pizza.\n\t+ Consequent: Bob chose pasta.\n* The antecedent is a statement about Sue's choice, so it must be true in order for the conclusion to be logically valid. However, we have already determined that the premise is not logically valid, so this conclusion is also not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the premise is not logically valid and the conclusion cannot be drawn from an invalid premise.",
