The if-clause states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the antecedent and the validity of the consequent.\n\t+ Antecedent: If Jeff played basketball.\n\t+ Consequent: Amy played tennis.\n* The antecedent is a statement about Jeff's actions, so it must be true in order for the argument to be logically valid. However, we don't know whether Jeff actually played basketball or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether this premise is logically valid without more information.\n\nPremise 2: Jeff played basketball.\n\n* This premise is a statement about Jeff's actions, so it must be true in order for the argument to be logically valid. We can assume that Jeff did play basketball based on the information provided in the argument.\n\nConclusion: Amy played tennis.\n\n* This conclusion follows from the two premises. If Jeff played basketball (premise 1), then it is likely that Amy played tennis (premise 2). However, we don't know for certain whether this conclusion is logically valid without more information.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because we cannot determine the validity of the antecedent in premise 1 without more information.",
