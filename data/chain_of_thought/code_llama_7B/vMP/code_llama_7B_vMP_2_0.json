This premise is sound because it is based on a reasonable assumption about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"The griffin was in the forest\" is also a fact, which means that the argument is complete.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because it is both sound and complete.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
