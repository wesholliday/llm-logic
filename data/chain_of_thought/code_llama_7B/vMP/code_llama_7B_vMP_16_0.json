            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its soundness and completeness.\n\nSoundness: The first premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement that states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This premise is true because it is possible to make denim pants from cotton fabric. Therefore, this argument is sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"The shirt was cotton\" is also a fact that is known to be true. Therefore, the argument is complete.\n\nSince both the first and second premises are true, and the conclusion follows logically from them, we can conclude that this argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
