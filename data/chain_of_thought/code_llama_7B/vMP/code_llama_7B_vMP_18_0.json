The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. In fact, there are many possible scenarios in which this could be false.\n2. The second premise states that the doll was plastic. This premise is a simple statement of fact, and it is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that if the first premise is true (i.e., if the doll was plastic), then the truck must have been metal. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premises. In fact, there are many possible scenarios in which the truck could have been made of a different material altogether.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and it is not necessarily true that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.",
