However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the muffins are blueberry, as there may be other factors at play. Therefore, this argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"The cake was chocolate\" provides evidence for the first premise, but it does not provide any evidence for the conclusion \"The muffins were blueberry\". Therefore, this argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
