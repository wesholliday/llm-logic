The if-clause states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of the antecedent and the validity of the consequent.\n\t+ Antecedent: If Tom watched football.\n\t+ Consequent: Jen watched basketball.\n* The antecedent is a statement about Tom's actions, so it must be evaluated based on whether or not it is true. In this case, we can assume that Tom did watch football, since the argument is based on the assumption that he did. Therefore, the antecedent is valid.\n* The consequent is also a statement about Jen's actions, so it must be evaluated based on whether or not it is true. However, we cannot know for certain whether or not Jen watched basketball, since the argument does not provide any information about her actions. Therefore, the consequent is not valid.\n\nPremise 2: Tom watched football.\n\n* This premise is a statement about Tom's actions, so it must be evaluated based on whether or not it is true. In this case, we can assume that Tom did watch football, since the argument is based on the assumption that he did. Therefore, the premise is valid.\n\nConclusion: Jen watched basketball.\n\n* This conclusion is a statement about Jen's actions, so it must be evaluated based on whether or not it is true. However, we cannot know for certain whether or not Jen watched basketball, since the argument does not provide any information about her actions. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because the premises are not sufficient to justify the conclusion.",
