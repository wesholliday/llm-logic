It could be that Sam took a plane but Erin took a different mode of transportation. Therefore, this premise is not logically valid.\n\nStep 2: Sam took a plane.\nThis premise is a factual statement and is therefore logically valid.\n\nStep 3: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\nBased on the first premise, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, this inference is not necessarily true in all possible worlds. It could be that there are other possibilities where Sam took a plane but Erin took a different mode of transportation. Therefore, this conclusion is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
