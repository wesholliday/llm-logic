The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the bear and the wolf is. However, we can assume that the bear and the wolf are related in some way, such as the bear being the parent of the wolf.\n2. The second premise states that the bear was in the cave. This premise is a factual statement, and it is not disputed.\n3. The conclusion states that the wolf was in the den. This conclusion is also a factual statement, but it is based on the assumption that the bear was in the cave, which may or may not be true. Therefore, we need to evaluate whether this argument is logically valid.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider the relationship between the bear and the wolf. If the bear and the wolf are related as parents, then it is possible that the wolf was in the den if the bear was in the cave. However, if the bear and the wolf are not related, then it is not possible for the wolf to be in the den if the bear is in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we need to evaluate whether the argument is logically valid based on the relationship between the bear and the wolf. If the bear and the wolf are related as parents, then the argument is logically valid. However, if the bear and the wolf are not related, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
