            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its soundness and completeness.\n\nSoundness: The first premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that asserts a necessary condition for the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding.\" If the antecedent of this conditional statement is true (i.e., if Mary was at the wedding), then the consequent must also be true (i.e., Sue was at the wedding). Therefore, the first premise is sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"Mary was at the wedding\" is a fact that is independent of the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the second premise were false (i.e., Mary was not at the wedding), then the argument would still be valid, since the conditional statement in the first premise would not be true. Therefore, the argument is complete.\n\nSince both the soundness and completeness of the argument have been evaluated as true, we can conclude that it is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
