This premise is sound because it is based on a reasonable assumption about the relationship between the book and its author.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"The book was written by James\" is also a factual statement that is independent of the first premise. Therefore, this argument is complete because it provides all the necessary information to reach the conclusion.\n\nSince both the soundness and completeness criteria are met, we can conclude that this argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
