This premise is true because it is a logical consequence of the fact that Tom did not watch football. Therefore, the argument is sound.\n\nCompleteness:\nThe second premise states that Tom did not watch football. However, this premise does not logically entail the conclusion that Jen did not watch basketball. In other words, the absence of a necessary condition (Tom watching football) does not guarantee the non-existence of its logical consequence (Jen watching basketball). Therefore, the argument is incomplete.\n\nTherefore, the argument is neither sound nor complete, and it is therefore logically invalid.",
