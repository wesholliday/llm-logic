The if-clause states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n* To determine whether this premise is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the if-clause and the then-clause.\n\t+ If the cake was chocolate: This statement is false, since we are given that the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, the antecedent of this premise is false.\n\t+ The muffins were blueberry: This statement is also false, since we are given that the muffins were not blueberry. Therefore, the consequent of this premise is false.\n* Since both the if-clause and the then-clause are false, this premise is logically invalid.\n\nPremise 2: The cake was not chocolate.\n\n* This premise is a simple statement that states that the cake was not chocolate. It is true.\n\nConclusion: The muffins were not blueberry.\n\n* This conclusion follows logically from the first premise, since if the cake was not chocolate (which we have established to be false), then the muffins could not have been blueberry (which we have also established to be false). Therefore, this conclusion is also false.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically invalid because its first premise is logically invalid and its conclusion follows from an invalid premise.",
