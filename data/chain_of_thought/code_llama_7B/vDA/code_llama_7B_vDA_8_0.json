The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the vampire's state of being and the mummy's state of being is. However, we can assume that there is some connection between the two, such as the vampire's state of being affecting the mummy's state of being.\n2. The second premise states that the vampire was not awake. This premise is a negative statement, and it implies that the vampire was in fact asleep or unconscious.\n3. The conclusion states that the mummy was not awake. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise if the relationship between the vampire's state of being and the mummy's state of being is such that if the vampire is asleep, then the mummy will also be asleep. However, it is not clear whether this relationship exists or how it would apply in this situation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine whether this argument is logically valid without further information about the relationship between the vampire and the mummy. If there is no such relationship, then the argument is not logically valid.",
