The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the car and the truck is. We don't know whether the car and the truck are related in any way.\n2. The second premise states that the car was not red. This is an independent statement, and it does not affect our understanding of the relationship between the car and the truck.\n3. The conclusion states that the truck was not blue. This is also an independent statement, and it does not depend on any of the previous premises.\n\nBased on these premises, we cannot conclude that the argument is logically valid. The first premise is a conditional statement that is not necessarily true, and the second premise is an independent statement that contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises, and the argument is not valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
