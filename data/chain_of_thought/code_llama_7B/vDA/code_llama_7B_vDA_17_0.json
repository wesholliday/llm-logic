If Ben did eat pasta, then it is not the case that Kate ate salad. Therefore, this premise is sound.\n\nThe second premise \"Ben did not eat pasta\" is also true.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"Kate did not eat salad\" follows logically from both premises if Ben did not eat pasta. If Ben did eat pasta, then it is not the case that Kate ate salad, regardless of whether or not he ate salad. Therefore, this argument is complete.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
