However, the second premise \"Mary was not at the wedding\" contradicts this necessary condition. Therefore, the argument is unsound because it assumes a false premise.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" is also a conditional statement that asserts an additional condition. However, there is no evidence to support this additional condition, and it is not implied by the first premise. Therefore, the argument is incomplete because it does not provide sufficient reasons for the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is neither logically valid nor logically sound.",
