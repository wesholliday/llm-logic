However, the second premise \"Sue did not choose pizza\" contradicts this conditional statement. If Sue did not choose pizza, then it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta either. Therefore, this argument is unsound because it relies on a false assumption.\n\nCompleteness:\nThe conclusion \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is also true in the absence of any premises. However, if we assume that Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, then the conclusion follows logically from the first premise. Therefore, this argument is incomplete because it does not provide a sufficient reason for the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is neither sound nor complete, and therefore it is not logically valid.",
