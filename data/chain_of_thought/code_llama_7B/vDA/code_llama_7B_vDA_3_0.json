However, this is not necessarily the case, as there may be other authors who have written mystery novels. Therefore, the argument's soundness depends on the validity of the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" logically follows from both premises if the first premise is true and the second premise is false. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the argument's soundness. For example, if the first premise is false (i.e., the book was written by someone other than James), then the conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" may still be true even though the argument is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because its soundness depends on the validity of the conditional statement and its completeness depends on the truth of the premises.",
