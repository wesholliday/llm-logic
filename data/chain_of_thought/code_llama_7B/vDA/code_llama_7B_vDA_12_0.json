            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its soundness and completeness.\n\nSoundness: The first premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement that implies a necessary consequence. If the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is false, then the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) does not necessarily follow. However, in this case, we can assume that Joe did go to the park, since we are given that he did not. Therefore, the first premise is sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"Joe did not go to the park\" is a necessary condition for the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" If this premise were false, then Lucy could have gone to the zoo even if Joe did not go to the park. However, we are given that Joe did not go to the park, so this premise is complete.\n\nSince both the first and second premises are sound and the conclusion follows logically from them, this argument is logically valid. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
