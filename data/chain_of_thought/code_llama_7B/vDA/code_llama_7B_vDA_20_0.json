However, the second premise \"The apple was not red\" contradicts this condition, so the argument is unsound.\n\nCompleteness: The conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\" is not necessarily true based on the given premises alone. Therefore, the argument is incomplete.\n\nTherefore, the argument is neither logically valid nor sound.",
