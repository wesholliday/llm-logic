            "content": "\nTo determine whether this form of argument is logically valid, we need to follow the steps outlined in the previous question. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear whether it is true or false.\n2. The second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This premise is also a fact, and it is not clear whether it is true or false.\n3. The conclusion states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This conclusion is also a conditional statement, and it is not clear whether it is true or false.\n4. To determine whether this form of argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of each premise and the validity of the conclusion.\n5. The first premise is false because Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the conditional statement in the first premise is also false.\n6. The second premise is true because Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the conditional statement in the second premise is also true.\n7. The conclusion is false because Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but the conditional statement in the conclusion is false. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
