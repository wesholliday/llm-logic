            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its validity step by step.\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the doll and the truck is. However, we can assume that the doll and the truck are related in some way, such as the doll being inside the truck.\n2. The second premise states that the doll was not plastic. This premise is a negative statement, and it implies that the doll was actually made of another material, such as wood or fabric.\n3. The conclusion states that the truck was not metal. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises, since if the doll was not plastic, then it must have been made of a different material than the truck. Therefore, the truck cannot be metal.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement to reason from one conclusion to another. The argument starts with an assumption that the doll and the truck are related in some way, and then uses this assumption to reach a logical conclusion about the material of the truck.",
