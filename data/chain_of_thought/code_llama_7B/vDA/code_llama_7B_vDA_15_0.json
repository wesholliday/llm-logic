It is possible that Sam took a plane but Erin did not take a train. Therefore, the argument is not sound.\n\nCompleteness: The second premise \"Sam did not take a plane\" is true. However, it does not logically follow from the first premise that Erin did not take a train. Therefore, the argument is not complete.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
