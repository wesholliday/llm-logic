            "content": "\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its validity based on the rules of inference. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then).\n\nThe second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball. This premise is also a conditional statement, but it is in the form of a negated material implication (if-then).\n\nThe conclusion states that Amy did not play tennis. This conclusion is also a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a negated material implication (if-then).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of this argument based on the rules of inference. The first premise is a conditional statement, and it is in the form of a material implication (if-then). Therefore, we need to determine whether the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) logically entails the consequent (Amy played tennis).\n\nThe second premise is also a conditional statement, but it is in the form of a negated material implication (if-then). Therefore, we need to determine whether the antecedent (Jeff did not play basketball) logically entails the consequent (Amy did not play tennis).\n\nSince the second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball, and the conclusion states that Amy did not play tennis, it is possible that the antecedent of the first premise does not logically entail the consequent. In other words, it is possible that Jeff played basketball but Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because the second premise contradicts the conclusion.",
