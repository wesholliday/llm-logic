The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the dog and the cat is. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume that this premise is true.\n2. The second premise states that the dog was not inside. This premise is also a factual statement, and it is also true.\n3. The conclusion states that the cat was not outside. This conclusion follows logically from the first two premises if the relationship between the dog and the cat is such that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be outside. However, we have no information about this relationship, so it is not possible to determine whether this conclusion is true or false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on an unstated assumption about the relationship between the dog and the cat. If we were to assume that the relationship is such that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be outside, then the argument would be logically valid. However, without this assumption, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n### Answer: No",
