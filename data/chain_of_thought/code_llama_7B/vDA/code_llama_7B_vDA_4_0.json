The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter is. However, we can assume that there is some connection between these two events.\n2. The second premise states that the alien did not visit Mars. This premise is also a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter is. However, we can assume that there is some connection between these two events.\n3. The conclusion states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This conclusion is a conditional statement, and it is based on the assumption that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the validity of this argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, and it is not clear what the relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter is. However, we can assume that there is some connection between these two events.\n2. The second premise is also a conditional statement, and it is based on the assumption that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n3. The conclusion is a conditional statement, and it is based on the assumption that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that this argument is logically valid. The first premise establishes a connection between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter, while the second premise provides evidence that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from these two premises.\n\n### Answer: Yes",
