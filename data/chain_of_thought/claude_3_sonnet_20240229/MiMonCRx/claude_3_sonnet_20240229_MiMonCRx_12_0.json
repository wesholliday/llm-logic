            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The zibble might be frobbed and quorked' is a compound statement made up of two parts: 'The zibble might be frobbed' and 'The zibble might be quorked', joined by the conjunction 'and'. In logic, if a compound statement of the form 'A and B' is true, then each of the individual statements 'A' and 'B' must also be true. Therefore, if 'The zibble might be frobbed and quorked' is true, then 'The zibble might be quorked' must also be true, since it is one of the component parts of the original compound statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
