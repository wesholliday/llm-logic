            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The snorkel might be plimped and froodled\" contains the phrase \"froodled\". This phrase is also present in the proposed inference \"The snorkel might be froodled\". Since the original sentence states that the snorkel might be froodled (among other things), we can logically infer that the snorkel might be froodled from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
