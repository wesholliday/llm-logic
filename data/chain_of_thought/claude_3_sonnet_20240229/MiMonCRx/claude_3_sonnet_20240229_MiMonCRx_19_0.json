            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The blimple might be snorked and frobbed' is a compound sentence joined by the conjunction 'and'. This means that both conditions ('snorked' and 'frobbed') are presented as possibilities. When we consider the statement 'The blimple might be frobbed', it is a simpler statement that only mentions one of the two possibilities from the original compound sentence. Since the original sentence states that both 'snorked' and 'frobbed' are possible, we can logically infer that the possibility of 'frobbed' alone is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
