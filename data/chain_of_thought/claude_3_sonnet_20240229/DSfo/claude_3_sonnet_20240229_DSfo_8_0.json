The first premise eliminates the possibility of the remote control being under the couch.\n2. The second premise states that the remote control must be either under the couch or on the coffee table.\n3. Since the first option (under the couch) is eliminated, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
