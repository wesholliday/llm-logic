            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that the document needs to satisfy at least one of the two conditions: being signed or being notarized. It does not explicitly state that the document must have been signed. However, since the statement uses the word \"or,\" it means that either condition (being signed or being notarized) is sufficient. Therefore, we can infer that if the document was signed, it would satisfy the requirement stated in the original statement, regardless of whether it was notarized or not.\n\nAnswer: yes"
