The use of the word \"or\" indicates that both possibilities (formal and semi-formal) are valid options. To infer that \"The event must have been formal\" would be too restrictive and would exclude the possibility of it being semi-formal, which is also presented as an option in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
