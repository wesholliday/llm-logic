            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the package was delivered yesterday, or it was delivered the day before. This statement does not definitively confirm that the package was delivered yesterday. It only states that one of the two options (yesterday or the day before) must be true.\n\nTo infer \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" from the original statement, we would need additional information or context to rule out the possibility of it being delivered the day before. Without such additional information, the original statement does not provide enough evidence to make the stronger claim that the package must have been delivered specifically yesterday.\n\nAnswer: no"
