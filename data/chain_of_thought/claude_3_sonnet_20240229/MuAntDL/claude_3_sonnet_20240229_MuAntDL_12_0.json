The project was not completed by Friday, but it was extended.\n\nThe statement does not definitively state that the project must have been completed by Friday. It allows for the possibility that the project was extended if it was not completed by Friday.\n\nTo infer \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" from the given statement would be an overreach, as the statement explicitly mentions the alternative option of the project being extended.\n\nAnswer: no"
