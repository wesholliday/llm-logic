However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the exam was difficult. It could have been easy as well.\n\nTo infer \"The exam must have been difficult\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or context that rules out the possibility of the exam being easy. Without such additional information, the given statement alone does not allow us to make that specific inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
