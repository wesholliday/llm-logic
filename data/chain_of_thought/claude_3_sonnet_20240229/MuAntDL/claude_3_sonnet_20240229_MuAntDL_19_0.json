            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online or in person\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two alternatives: either the application was completed online, or it was completed in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two options must be true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The application must have been completed online\" from this statement, we need to consider the logical implications of a disjunctive statement.\n\nIf a disjunctive statement is true, it means that at least one of the alternatives is true, but it does not necessarily mean that both alternatives are true. In other words, the statement \"The application must have been completed online or in person\" allows for the possibility that the application was completed online, but it does not guarantee it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer \"The application must have been completed online\" from the given statement because the statement also allows for the possibility that the application was completed in person.\n\nAnswer: no"
