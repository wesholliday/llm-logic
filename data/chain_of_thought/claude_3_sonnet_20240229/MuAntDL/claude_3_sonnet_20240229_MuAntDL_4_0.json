            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two possibilities: either the meeting was at 2 PM, or it was cancelled. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the meeting must have been at 2 PM.\n\nThe disjunctive statement only tells us that one of the two possibilities (the meeting being at 2 PM or being cancelled) must be true, but it does not specify which one is true. It leaves open the possibility that either option could have occurred.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or context that rules out the possibility of the meeting being cancelled. Without such additional information, the given statement alone does not allow us to conclude definitively that the meeting must have been at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: no"
