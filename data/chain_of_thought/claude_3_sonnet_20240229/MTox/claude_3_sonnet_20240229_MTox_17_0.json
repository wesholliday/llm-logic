The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q).\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nSince we are given that \"The flob did not movated,\" and the contrapositive states that \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled,\" we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
