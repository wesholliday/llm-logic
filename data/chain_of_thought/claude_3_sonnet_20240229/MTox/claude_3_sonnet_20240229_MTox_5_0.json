The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn our case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nWe know from the first statement that \"The zinger was not smoogled\" is true.\n\nTherefore, by the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
