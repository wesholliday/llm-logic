            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logic and inference.\n\nGiven:\n- Premise 1: \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n- Premise 2: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" from these premises.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the twonk was plinked,\" and B is \"the twonk was varnished.\"\n\nThe first premise directly contradicts the consequent (B) of the conditional statement, stating that \"the twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nIn logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, we can infer that the antecedent (A) must also be false. This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
