The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nSubstituting the given statements, the contrapositive becomes: \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\".\n\nThis contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nSince the first premise states \"The wug did not bim the zoint\", and the contrapositive states \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\", we can indeed infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
