            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked,\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nWe can represent the negation of Q as \"\u00acQ,\" which means \"the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n1. If P is true (the sprocket was cranked), and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then Q must be true (the sprocket was daggled). However, we know that Q is false (the sprocket was not daggled).\n\n2. Therefore, if Q is false (the sprocket was not daggled), and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then P must be false (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\nThis reasoning is based on the logical principle known as \"modus tollens,\" which states that if the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
