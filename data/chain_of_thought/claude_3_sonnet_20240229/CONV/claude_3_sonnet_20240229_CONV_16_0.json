            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton,\" we need to consider the converse of the given statement.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is formed by interchanging the hypothesis and the conclusion. In this case, the converse would be: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nHowever, the converse of a true conditional statement is not necessarily true. It is a fallacy to assume that the converse is true without additional information or justification.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
