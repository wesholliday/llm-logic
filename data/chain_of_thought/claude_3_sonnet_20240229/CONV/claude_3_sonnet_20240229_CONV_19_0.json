            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n\nThis is also a conditional statement, but with the antecedent (the \"If\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part) swapped.\n\nIn propositional logic, the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not imply the converse statement \"If B, then A.\" The converse is a separate statement that may or may not be true, depending on the specific situation.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we cannot logically infer the converse statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
