It is a fallacy known as the \"converse error\" or \"fallacy of the inverse\" to assume that the converse is true based solely on the truth of the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" from the given statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nAnswer: no"
