The converse is only true if the original implication is a biconditional statement (P \u2194 Q), which means that P and Q are logically equivalent and imply each other.\n\nIn the given statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" there is no information indicating that the converse is also true. It is possible that the truck was metal due to other reasons, not necessarily because the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
