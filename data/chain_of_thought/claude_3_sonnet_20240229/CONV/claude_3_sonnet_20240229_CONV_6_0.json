In this case, the converse would be \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical relationship between the original statement and its converse.\nIn general, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The converse can be true or false, depending on the specific situation.\n\nAnswer: No"
