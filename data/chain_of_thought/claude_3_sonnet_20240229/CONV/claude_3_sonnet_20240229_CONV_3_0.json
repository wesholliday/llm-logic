The truth of \"If A, then B\" does not imply the truth of \"If B, then A.\"\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" The converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" from the given statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement."
