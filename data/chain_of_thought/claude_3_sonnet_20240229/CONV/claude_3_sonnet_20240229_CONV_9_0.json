            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nThis is also a conditional statement, but with the antecedent (the \"If\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part) swapped.\n\nIn propositional logic, the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is not equivalent to the statement \"If B, then A.\" The two statements have different truth values in certain cases.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
