In other words, from A \u2192 B, we cannot infer B \u2192 A without additional information or assumptions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
