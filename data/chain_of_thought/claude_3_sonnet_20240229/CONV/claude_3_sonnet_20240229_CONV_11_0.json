There could be other reasons or conditions that led to the muffins being blueberry, independent of the cake being chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" from the given statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: no"
