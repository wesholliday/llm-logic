In other words, if the first statement is true, we cannot conclude that the second statement is also true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This statement does not imply that \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining.\" The ground could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler system or a spilled liquid.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den,\" we cannot infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
