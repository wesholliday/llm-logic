            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis is the converse of the given statement, which has the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The truth of \"If A, then B\" does not imply the truth of \"If B, then A.\"\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" The converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spilled drink.\n\nSimilarly, in the given statement, the fact that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" There could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding, even if Mary was not there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
