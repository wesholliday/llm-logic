In other words, it leaves open the possibility that someone else wrote the book.\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the statement \"The book must have been written by James.\"\nThe negation of \"The book must have been written by James\" is \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n\nStep 3: Compare the two statements.\nThe statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" is logically equivalent to \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the given statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" implies that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James, we can infer that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
