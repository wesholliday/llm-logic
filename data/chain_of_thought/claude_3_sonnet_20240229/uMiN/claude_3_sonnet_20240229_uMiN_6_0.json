            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationships between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"\n\nThis statement is equivalent to saying \"It is possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nThis statement is the negation of \"Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\nIf it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza (the given statement), then it cannot be the case that Sue must have chosen pizza (the statement we want to infer). This is because if Sue must have chosen pizza, then it would be impossible for her not to have chosen pizza.\n\nIn other words, if the given statement is true, then the statement we want to infer must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from the given statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
