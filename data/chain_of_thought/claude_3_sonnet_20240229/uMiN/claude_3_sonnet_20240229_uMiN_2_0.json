In other words, the negation of \"the griffin must have been in the forest\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n\nThis statement is the direct negation of \"the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n\nSince the given statement implies that the negation of \"the griffin must have been in the forest\" is true, we can infer that \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
