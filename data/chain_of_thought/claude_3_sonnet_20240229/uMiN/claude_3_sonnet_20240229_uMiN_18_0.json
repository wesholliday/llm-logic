In other words, the negation of \"the notebook must be in the drawer\" is true.\n\nThe statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\"\n\nThis statement is the direct negation of \"the notebook must be in the drawer.\"\n\nSince the given statement implies that the negation of \"the notebook must be in the drawer\" is true, we can logically infer that \"it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning is valid, and we can infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
