In other words, the negation of \"the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" is true.\n\nStep 1: Negate the statement \"the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\"\nNegation: \"It is not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the negated statement is equivalent to the given statement, \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\"\nThe negated statement and the given statement are logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
