In other words, it is possible that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the statement \"The shoes must be in the closet.\"\nThe negation of \"The shoes must be in the closet\" is \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nStep 3: Compare the two statements.\nThe statement \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" is logically equivalent to \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nTherefore, if we are given that \"The shoes might not be in the closet,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
