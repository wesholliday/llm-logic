In other words, it is possible that the milk is not on the counter.\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the statement \"The milk must be on the counter.\"\nThe negation of \"The milk must be on the counter\" is \"It is not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\"\n\nStep 3: Compare the two statements.\nThe statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" is logically equivalent to \"It is not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the milk might not be on the counter, then it is not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
