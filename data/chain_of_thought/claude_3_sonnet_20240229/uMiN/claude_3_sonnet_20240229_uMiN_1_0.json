In other words, the negation of \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" is true.\n\nStep 1: Negate the statement \"Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\nNegation: \"It is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the negated statement is equivalent to the given statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\nThe negated statement \"It is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is logically equivalent to \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
