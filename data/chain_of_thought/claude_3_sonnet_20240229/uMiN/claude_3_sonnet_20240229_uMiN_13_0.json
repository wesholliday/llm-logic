In other words, the negation of \"the toy must be in the toy box\" is true.\n\nStep 1: Negate the statement \"the toy must be in the toy box.\"\nNegation: \"It is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n\nStep 2: Compare the negated statement with the given statement.\nThe negated statement \"It is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" is logically equivalent to \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
