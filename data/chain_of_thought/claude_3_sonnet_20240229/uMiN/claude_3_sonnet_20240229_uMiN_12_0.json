In other words, the negation of \"the jacket must be draped over the chair\" is true.\n\nStep 1: Negate the statement \"the jacket must be draped over the chair.\"\nNegation: \"It is not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\"\n\nStep 2: Compare the negated statement with the given statement.\nThe negated statement is logically equivalent to the given statement: \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
