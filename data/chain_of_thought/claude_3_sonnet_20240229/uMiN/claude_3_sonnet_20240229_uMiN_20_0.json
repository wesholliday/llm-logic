In other words, it is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the statement \"The sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\nThe negation of \"The sunglasses must be in her bag\" is \"It is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\nStep 3: Compare the two statements.\nThe statement \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" is logically equivalent to \"It is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the given statement implies that it is possible for the sunglasses not to be in her bag, we can infer that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
