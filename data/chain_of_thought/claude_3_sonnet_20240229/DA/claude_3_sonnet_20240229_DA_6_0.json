In other words, denying the antecedent does not allow us to infer anything about the consequent.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer anything about the consequent (\"Bob chose pasta\") when the antecedent (\"Sue chose pizza\") is false, we cannot conclude that \"Bob did not choose pasta\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
