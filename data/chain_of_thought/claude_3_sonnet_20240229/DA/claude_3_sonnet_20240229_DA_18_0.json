It only states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The doll was not plastic\" is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, the negation of the antecedent in a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the negation of the consequent.\n\nIn other words, from the statements:\n\"If A, then B\" and \"Not A\"\nWe cannot logically conclude \"Not B.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements:\n\"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was not plastic\"\nWe cannot infer \"The truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
