In other words, denying the antecedent does not allow us to infer the truth or falsity of the consequent.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we have denied the antecedent (\"Jeff did not play basketball\"), we cannot infer anything about the consequent (\"Amy did not play tennis\") based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
