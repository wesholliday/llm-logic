            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that if the condition A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence B (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is the negation of the condition A in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (antecedent) is false, the consequence (consequent) can be either true or false. The truth value of the consequent is not determined.\n\nSince the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is negated (false), we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
