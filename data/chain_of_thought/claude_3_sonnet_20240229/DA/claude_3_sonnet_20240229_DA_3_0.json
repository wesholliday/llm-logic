In other words, if p is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about q.\n\nThe second statement (\u00acp) tells us that p is false.\n\nStep 3: Combine the statements and draw a conclusion.\nSince p is false (\u00acp), we cannot make any definite conclusion about q based on the conditional statement (p \u2192 q). The truth value of q remains unknown.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
