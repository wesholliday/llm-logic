In other words, denying the antecedent does not allow us to infer anything about the consequent.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer anything about the consequent (\"the muffins were blueberry\") from denying the antecedent (\"the cake was chocolate\"), we cannot conclude that \"the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
