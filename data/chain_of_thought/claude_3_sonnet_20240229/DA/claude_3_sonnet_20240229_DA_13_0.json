            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. \"The car was not red.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nThis statement does not provide any information about the truth or falsity of the antecedent (A: \"the car was red\") or the consequent (B: \"the truck was blue\") individually. It only states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The car was not red\" is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, the negation of the antecedent in a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the negation of the consequent. In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that \"not A\" is true, we cannot conclude that \"not B\" is true.\n\nThis is because the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. It only tells us what happens when A is true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer \"The truck was not blue\" from the given statements. The negation of the antecedent (\"The car was not red\") does not allow us to conclude the negation of the consequent (\"The truck was not blue\") in a conditional statement."
