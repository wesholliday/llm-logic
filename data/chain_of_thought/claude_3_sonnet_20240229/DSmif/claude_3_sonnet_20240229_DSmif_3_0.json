            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n2. \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. It can be represented symbolically as: A or B, where A is \"the keys are dangling in the cabinet,\" and B is \"the keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe second statement negates the first part of the disjunction, which means that A is false.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if one part of a disjunction is false, and the disjunction itself is true, then the other part must be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" (not A) is true, and the disjunctive statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" (A or B) is also true, then the only remaining possibility is that \"the keys are in the drawer\" (B) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
