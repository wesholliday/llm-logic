The first statement is a disjunctive statement: \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n2. The second statement negates the first part of the disjunctive statement: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n3. If one part of a disjunctive statement is negated, we can infer the other part.\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
