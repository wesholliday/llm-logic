It establishes a relationship between two events: \"Tom watched football\" (the antecedent or hypothesis) and \"Jen watched basketball\" (the consequent or conclusion).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent or hypothesis of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the consequent must also be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 1: Identify the antecedent and consequent of the conditional statement.\nAntecedent: \"Tom watched football\"\nConsequent: \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the antecedent is true.\nThe second statement affirms that \"Tom watched football,\" which is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the modus ponens rule of inference.\nIf the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the rules of logical inference, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
