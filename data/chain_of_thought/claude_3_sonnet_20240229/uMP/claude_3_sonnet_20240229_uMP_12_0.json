It establishes a relationship between two events: if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true.\n\nIn propositional logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, we can infer that the consequent must also be true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\nStep 2: Identify the antecedent: \"Joe went to the park.\"\nStep 3: The antecedent is true (given in the second statement).\nStep 4: Apply the rule of modus ponens: If the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the rules of logical inference, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes"
