It establishes a relationship between two events: \"Ben ate pasta\" (the antecedent or hypothesis) and \"Kate ate salad\" (the consequent or conclusion).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent or hypothesis of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. The antecedent \"Ben ate pasta\" is true (given in the second statement).\n2. The conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is given as true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that the consequent \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true.\n2. The antecedent \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n3. If the antecedent of a true conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent \"Kate ate salad\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
