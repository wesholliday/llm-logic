It has the form:\nIf A (the vampire was awake), then B (the mummy was awake).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of logical inference.\nIf the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"the vampire was awake\" (A) is true, and the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is also true, we can logically infer that \"the mummy was awake\" (B) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
