It establishes a relationship between two propositions: \"the bear was in the cave\" (antecedent) and \"the wolf was in the den\" (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the consequent must also be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 1: Identify the antecedent and consequent of the conditional statement.\nAntecedent: \"The bear was in the cave.\"\nConsequent: \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the antecedent is true.\nThe second statement affirms that \"The bear was in the cave,\" which is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the modus ponens rule of inference.\nIf the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes"
