It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\nIn this case, A = \"the dog was inside,\" and B = \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement directly affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of logical inference.\nIf the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"the dog was inside\" (A) is true, and the conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is given as true, we can logically infer that \"the cat was outside\" (B) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
