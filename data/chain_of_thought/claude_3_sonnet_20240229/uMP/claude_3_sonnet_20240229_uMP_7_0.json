If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Alex finished the race.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Alex finished the race,\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth value of the premise (P).\nThe second statement, \"Alex finished the race,\" confirms that the premise P is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of logical inference for conditional statements.\nIf the premise (P) of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the premise \"Alex finished the race\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is given as true, we can infer that the conclusion \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
