It establishes a relationship between two propositions: \"Jeff played basketball\" (the antecedent) and \"Amy played tennis\" (the consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is given as true, we can logically conclude that \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is given as true.\n2. The antecedent \"Jeff played basketball\" is also given as true.\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, if the antecedent of a true conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
