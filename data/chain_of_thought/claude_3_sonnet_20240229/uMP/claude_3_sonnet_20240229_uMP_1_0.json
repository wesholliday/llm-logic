It states that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the condition \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nP: \"Mary was at the wedding\" (which is true according to the second statement)\nQ: \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nSince the condition P is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can logically infer that Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
