The conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is given as true.\n2. The antecedent \"the shirt was cotton\" is also given as true.\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, if the antecedent of a true conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent \"the pants were denim\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
