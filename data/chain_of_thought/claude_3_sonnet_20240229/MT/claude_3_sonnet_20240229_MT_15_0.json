This is known as the \"fallacy of denying the consequent.\"\n\nIn other words, if we know that \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is false, we cannot conclude that A is false. It is possible that A is false, but it is also possible that A is true, and the conditional statement itself is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
