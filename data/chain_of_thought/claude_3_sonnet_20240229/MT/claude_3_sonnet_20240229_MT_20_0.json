If the antecedent (p) is true and the consequent (q) is false, then the conditional statement is false.\n\nIn our case, we know that q is false (\u00acq is true) from the second statement.\n\nIf we assume that p is true, then the conditional statement p \u2192 q would be false, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, to maintain the consistency of the given statements, we must conclude that p is false, i.e., \u00acp is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
