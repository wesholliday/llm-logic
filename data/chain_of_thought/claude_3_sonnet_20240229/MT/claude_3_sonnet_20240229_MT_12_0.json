However, if the consequent (q) is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (p) must be false.\n\nIn this case, we know that q is false (\u00acq) from the second statement.\n\nStep 3: Use the modus tollens rule of inference.\nModus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\nIf p \u2192 q is true, and \u00acq is true, then we can infer \u00acp.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our case:\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (\"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\")\nPremise 2: \u00acq (\"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\")\nConclusion: \u00acp (\"Joe did not go to the park.\")\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
