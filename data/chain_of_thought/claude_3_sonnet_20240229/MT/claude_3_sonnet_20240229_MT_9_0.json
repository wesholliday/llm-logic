            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. However, if the antecedent (A) is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about the consequent (B).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is the negation of the consequent (B) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is true, and the consequent (B) is false, then we can infer that the conditional statement itself is false. This is known as the modus tollens rule of inference.\n\nIn our case, we have:\nAntecedent (A): \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\nConsequent (B): \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\nNegation of the consequent: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n\nSince we know that the negation of the consequent is true (\"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"), we can apply the modus tollens rule and infer that the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is false.\n\nHowever, the falsity of the conditional statement does not necessarily imply the falsity of the antecedent (A). In other words, we cannot conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
