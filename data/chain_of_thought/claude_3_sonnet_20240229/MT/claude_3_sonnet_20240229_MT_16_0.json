This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference.\n\nIn our case, since the consequent \"the pants were denim\" is negated (false), we can infer that the antecedent \"the shirt was cotton\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
