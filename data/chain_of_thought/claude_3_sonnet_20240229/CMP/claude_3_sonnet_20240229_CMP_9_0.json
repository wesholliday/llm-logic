    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "To determine if the given conclusion follows from the premises, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits.\n2. It's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind.\n3. These are by far the top-selling fruits.\n4. If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be.\n5. It's likely that apples will be top, and hence bananas won't be.\n\nThe conclusion we need to evaluate is: \"If apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be.\"\n\nStep 1 and 2 establish the ranking of the three fruits in terms of sales, with apples likely being the top seller, followed by bananas, and then oranges.\n\nStep 3 reinforces that these three fruits are the top-selling fruits, implying that if one of them is not the top seller, one of the other two must be.\n\nStep 4 states that if bananas aren't the top seller, and apples aren't either, then oranges will be the top seller.\n\nStep 5 states that it's likely that apples will be the top seller, which implies that bananas won't be the top seller.\n\nCombining steps 4 and 5, we can infer that if apples aren't the top seller, then oranges will be the top seller, since bananas won't be the top seller (due to step 5).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
