    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "To determine if the given conclusion follows from the premises, let's break down the information provided:\n\nPremises:\n1. Coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages.\n2. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Tea likely will retain the second-most morning drinkers.\n4. Soda likely will be consumed much less in the mornings.\n5. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, and if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers (since there are no other major morning drinks).\n6. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nConclusion to be evaluated: If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nStep 1: From premise 6, we know that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, which implies that tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nStep 2: Premise 5 states that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, and if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nStep 3: However, the conclusion we need to evaluate is a conditional statement: \"If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\"\n\nStep 4: The premises do not directly support this conditional statement. While premise 5 provides a condition under which soda will retain the most morning drinkers, it does not specifically state that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: No, the given conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises provided. The premises do not directly support the conditional statement that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers."
