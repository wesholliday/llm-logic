    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

If Priya doesn't get the offer, then Julian is the next most likely candidate.\n3. If Julian doesn't get the offer, then Diego will get the offer (since they are the only top candidates).\n4. It's likely that Priya will get the offer, and hence it's likely that Julian won't get the offer.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Priya doesn't get the offer:\n\n5. If Priya doesn't get the offer, then Julian is the next candidate in line.\n6. However, we know from step 4 that it's likely Julian won't get the offer.\n7. Therefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer and Julian doesn't get the offer (which is likely), then Diego will get the offer (based on step 3).\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will."
