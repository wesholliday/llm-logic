    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

Doctors expect the flu to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, and then strep throat.\n3. If colds don't infect the most people, and if flu doesn't, then strep will.\n4. It is likely that flu will infect the most, and hence it is likely that colds won't infect the most.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where flu doesn't infect the most people.\n\nIf flu doesn't infect the most people, then based on the given information, either the common cold or strep throat must infect the most people.\n\nHowever, we know that it is likely that colds won't infect the most people (since it is likely that flu will infect the most).\n\nTherefore, if flu doesn't infect the most people, and it is likely that colds won't infect the most people, then it follows that it is likely that strep throat will infect the most people.\n\nAnswer: yes"
