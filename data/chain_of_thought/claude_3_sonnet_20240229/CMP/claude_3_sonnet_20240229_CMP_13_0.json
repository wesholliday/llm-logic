    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US.\n2. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n3. If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will.\n4. Tennessee likely will add the most jobs.\n5. Hence, Georgia likely won't add the most jobs.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will?\"\n\nGiven the information provided, we know that:\n- If Tennessee adds the most jobs (which is likely), then Georgia won't add the most jobs.\n- If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, and Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will add the most jobs.\n\nHowever, the statement \"if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will\" is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nThe reason is that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it's still possible that Georgia adds the most jobs instead of Missouri. The given information only states that if both Tennessee and Georgia don't add the most jobs, then Missouri will. But it doesn't rule out the possibility that Georgia could add the most jobs if Tennessee doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
