    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are three possible new laws: minimum wage hike, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness.\n2. Only one new law will be passed this session.\n3. The probabilities of each law being passed are: minimum wage hike (most likely), paid family leave (less likely than minimum wage hike), and student loan forgiveness (least likely).\n4. If paid family leave doesn't happen, and a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then student loan forgiveness will happen.\n5. A minimum wage hike is likely to happen.\n6. If a minimum wage hike happens, then paid family leave is unlikely to happen.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?\"\n\nGiven the information provided, we know that:\n- If a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, there are two possibilities: either paid family leave happens, or student loan forgiveness happens.\n- However, we also know that a minimum wage hike is likely to happen.\n- If a minimum wage hike happens, then paid family leave is unlikely to happen.\n- Therefore, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen (which is unlikely), it is more likely that paid family leave will happen than student loan forgiveness.\n\nAnswer: no"
