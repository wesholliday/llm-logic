            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been signed for\" implies that the package was delivered and someone signed to acknowledge its receipt. However, it does not specify when the delivery and signing occurred. The additional phrase \"yesterday\" in the second statement adds a temporal constraint that is not present in the original statement. To infer the second statement from the first, we would need additional information or context indicating that the delivery and signing happened specifically yesterday.\n\nAnswer: no"
