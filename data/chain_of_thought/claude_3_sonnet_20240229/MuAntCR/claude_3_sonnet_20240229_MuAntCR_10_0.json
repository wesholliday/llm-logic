            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies \"The document must have been signed and notarized\", we need to consider the meaning of the word \"notarized\".\n\nA document is notarized when a notary public witnesses the signing of the document and verifies the identity of the signer(s). The notarization process typically involves the signer(s) signing the document in the presence of the notary public.\n\nTherefore, if a document is notarized, it implies that it has been signed by the relevant parties. The act of notarization requires the document to be signed first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
