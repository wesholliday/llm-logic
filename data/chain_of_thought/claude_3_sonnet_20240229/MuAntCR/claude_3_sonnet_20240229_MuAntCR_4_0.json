It does not give any information about the time of the meeting. To infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\", we would need additional information or context that specifically mentions the time of 2 PM. Without that additional information, we cannot make the inference about the time from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
