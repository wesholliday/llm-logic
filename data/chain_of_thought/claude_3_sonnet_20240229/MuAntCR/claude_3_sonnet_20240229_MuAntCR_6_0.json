It does not give any information about whether the concert was sold out or not. To infer that \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM,\" we would need additional information or evidence that the concert was indeed sold out. Without any explicit mention of the concert being sold out, we cannot make that inference from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
