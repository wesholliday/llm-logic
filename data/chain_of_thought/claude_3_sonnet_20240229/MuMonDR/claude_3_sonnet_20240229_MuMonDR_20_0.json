            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies \"The event must have been semi-formal or formal\", we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement \"The event must have been formal\" is a specific claim that the event was formal in nature. This means that it excludes the possibility of the event being informal or casual.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The event must have been semi-formal or formal\" is a broader claim that covers two possibilities: either the event was semi-formal or it was formal.\n\nSince the original statement \"The event must have been formal\" is a more specific case that falls under the broader category of \"semi-formal or formal\", it logically implies the broader statement.\n\nIn other words, if the event was formal, then it must have been either semi-formal or formal, as formal is one of the two possibilities covered by the broader statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
