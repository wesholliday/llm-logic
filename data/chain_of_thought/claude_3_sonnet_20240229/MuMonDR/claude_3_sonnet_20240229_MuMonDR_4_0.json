It does not leave room for the possibility that the meeting was cancelled.\n\nThe statement \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM\" introduces an alternative possibility that the meeting was cancelled. This statement is broader and less definite than the original statement.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we would need additional information or context suggesting that the meeting might have been cancelled. Without such information, the second statement is not a valid inference from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
