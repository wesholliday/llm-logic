            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed\" can be inferred from \"The document must have been signed\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement, \"The document must have been signed\", asserts that the signing of the document is a necessary condition. This means that the document was definitely signed, but it does not provide any information about whether it was notarized or not.\n\nThe statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (notarized or signed) must be true.\n\nSince the original statement only confirms that the document was signed, it does not necessarily imply that it was notarized. Therefore, the disjunctive statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed\" cannot be logically inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
