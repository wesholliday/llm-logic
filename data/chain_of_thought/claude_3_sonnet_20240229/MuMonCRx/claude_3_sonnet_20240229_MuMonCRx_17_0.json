            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence 'The flonk must be frazzle and quank by quimble' contains two conditions for the flonk: it must be frazzle and it must be quank by quimble. The question asks if we can infer the second condition alone, 'The flonk must be quank by quimble', from the original sentence. Since the original sentence states that both conditions must be met, we can logically infer that the second condition alone is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
