            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence 'The wumble must be frazzle and quibble a quazzle' contains two conditions: 1) The wumble must be frazzle, and 2) The wumble must quibble a quazzle. The question asks if we can infer the second condition alone, 'The wumble must be quibble a quazzle', from the original sentence. To infer this, we need to determine if the second condition is a logical consequence of the original sentence, without relying on the first condition.\n\nAnswer: yes"
