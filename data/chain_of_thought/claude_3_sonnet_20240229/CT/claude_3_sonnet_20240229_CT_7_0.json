            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nLet's represent this statement symbolically:\nA \u2192 C (If A is true, then C is true)\n\nWe want to infer: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nSymbolically, this would be:\n\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA (If not C is true, then not A is true)\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n1. The given statement (A \u2192 C) does not imply the converse (C \u2192 A). In other words, if Alex finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Chris didn't finish, then Alex didn't finish either.\n\n2. To infer the statement (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA) from the given statement (A \u2192 C), we need to use the logical principle of contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of (A \u2192 C) is (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" from the given statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
