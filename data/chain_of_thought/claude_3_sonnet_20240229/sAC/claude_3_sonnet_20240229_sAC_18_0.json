This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\nThe ground being wet (consequent) does not necessarily mean that it rained (antecedent), as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, the truth of \"The truck was metal\" (consequent) does not necessarily imply the truth of \"The doll was plastic\" (antecedent).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given premises, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" being true and \"The truck was metal\" being true, do not logically imply that \"The doll was plastic\" is necessarily true."
