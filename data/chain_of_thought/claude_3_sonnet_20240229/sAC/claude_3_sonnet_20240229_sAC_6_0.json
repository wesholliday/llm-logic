In all other cases, it is true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth value of the second statement.\n\"Bob chose pasta\" is given as true.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rules of inference.\nIf the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, it does not necessarily imply that A is true. This is because the truth of the conditional statement does not depend solely on the truth of A.\n\nIn other words, the truth of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta\" does not guarantee the truth of \"Sue chose pizza.\" There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, independent of Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no"
