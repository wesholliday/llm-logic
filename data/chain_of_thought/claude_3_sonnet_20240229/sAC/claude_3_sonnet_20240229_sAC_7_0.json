Therefore, we cannot apply modus ponens to conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the converse of the conditional statement.\nThe converse of a conditional statement is obtained by swapping the antecedent and the consequent. In our case, the converse would be \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nHowever, the truth of the original conditional statement (A \u2192 C) does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The converse is a separate statement that may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
