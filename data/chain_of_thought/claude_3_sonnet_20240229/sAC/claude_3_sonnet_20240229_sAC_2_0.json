The truth of q (The unicorn was in the forest) does not necessarily imply the truth of p (The griffin was in the forest).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given premises do not logically imply that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true. The truth of the consequent (q) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (p) in a conditional statement (p \u2192 q)."
