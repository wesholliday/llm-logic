This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\nThe ground being wet (consequent) does not necessarily mean it's raining (antecedent), as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe truth of \"The banana was yellow\" and the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" do not logically imply that \"The apple was red\" is true. The antecedent (the apple being red) cannot be inferred from the truth of the consequent (the banana being yellow) alone."
