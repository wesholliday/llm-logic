This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\nThe ground being wet (consequent) does not necessarily mean that it rained (antecedent), as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, the truth of \"The truck was blue\" (consequent) does not necessarily imply the truth of \"The car was red\" (antecedent).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe truth of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue\" does not necessarily imply that \"The car was red\" is true. Additional information would be needed to determine the truth value of \"The car was red.\""
