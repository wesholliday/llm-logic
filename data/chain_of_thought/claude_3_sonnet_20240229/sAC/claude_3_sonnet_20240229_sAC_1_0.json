            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true.\n- \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \"Mary was at the wedding\" is necessarily true based on these premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\n\"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the truth values of the premises.\nThe first premise, \"If A, then B,\" is true.\nThe second premise, B (\"Sue was at the wedding\"), is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference for the conditional statement.\nIn logic, if the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, it does not necessarily imply that A is true. The truth of the consequent (B) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (A).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given information does not allow us to conclude with certainty that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true. It is possible that Sue attended the wedding for reasons other than Mary's attendance. The truth of the consequent (\"Sue was at the wedding\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (\"Mary was at the wedding\")."
