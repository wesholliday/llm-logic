            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be notarized\" implies that there is a possibility that the document has been notarized, which is the process of having a public official witness the signing of a document and attest to its authenticity. However, this statement alone does not necessarily imply that the document has been signed. Notarization typically requires the document to be signed in the presence of the notary public, but the original statement does not explicitly state that the document has been signed.\n\nTo infer \"The document might be signed and notarized,\" we would need additional information or context suggesting that the document has been or will be signed in addition to being notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
