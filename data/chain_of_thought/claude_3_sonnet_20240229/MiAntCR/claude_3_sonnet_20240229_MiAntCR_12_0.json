It only suggests that there is a possibility that the project's costs will be lower than the allocated budget.\n\nTo infer \"The project might be completed by Friday and be under budget,\" we need additional information confirming that the project has a chance of being finished by Friday. The original statement alone is not sufficient to make this broader inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
