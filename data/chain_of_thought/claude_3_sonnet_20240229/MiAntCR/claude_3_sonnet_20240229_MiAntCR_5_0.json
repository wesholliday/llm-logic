However, it does not explicitly state when the package will be delivered or that it will definitely be delivered today.\n\nTo infer \"The package might be delivered today and signed for,\" we need additional information or context suggesting that the package is expected to arrive on the current day. Without that additional context, the original statement only indicates the possibility of the package being signed for, but not necessarily the specific timing of the delivery.\n\nAnswer: no"
