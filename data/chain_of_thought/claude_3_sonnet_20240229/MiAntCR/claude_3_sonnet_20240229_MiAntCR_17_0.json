It only suggests the possibility that the report will be submitted by noon. To infer that \"The report might be accurate and be submitted by noon,\" we would need additional information or context indicating that the report is likely to be accurate.\n\nWithout any explicit mention of the report's accuracy in the original statement, we cannot logically infer that the report might be accurate. The original statement only allows us to infer the possibility of the report being submitted by noon, but it does not provide any basis for inferring its accuracy.\n\nAnswer: no"
