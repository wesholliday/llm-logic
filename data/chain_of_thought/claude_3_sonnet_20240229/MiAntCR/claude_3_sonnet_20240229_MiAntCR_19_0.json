It does not explicitly mention anything about the application being completed online.\n\nWhile it is possible that an application that includes references could be completed online, the original statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that. There could be applications that include references but are completed offline or through other means.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, the original statement would need to explicitly state or strongly imply that the application is completed online in addition to including references.\n\nAnswer: no"
