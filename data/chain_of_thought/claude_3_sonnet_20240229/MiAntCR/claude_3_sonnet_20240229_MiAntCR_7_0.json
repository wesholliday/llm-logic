Covering all chapters in an exam does not inherently mean that the exam will be difficult. It is possible for an exam to cover all chapters but still be relatively easy or manageable, depending on the level of difficulty of the questions and the depth of knowledge required.\n\nTo infer that \"The exam might be difficult and cover all chapters,\" we need additional information or context suggesting that covering all chapters would make the exam difficult. Without such context, we cannot make that inference based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
