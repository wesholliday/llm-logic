It has the form:\nIf A (Sam took a plane), then B (Erin took a train).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn deductive logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A). In other words, if the \"then\" part is true, it does not necessarily mean that the \"if\" part is also true.\n\nTo deduce \"Sam took a plane\" from the given statements, we would need the converse of the conditional statement, which is:\nIf Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nHowever, the converse is not given, and it cannot be assumed to be true based on the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot deduce with certainty that \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
