It has the form:\nIf A (the car was red), then B (the truck was blue).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth value of the second statement.\nThe statement \"The truck was blue\" is true, according to the given information.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\nIn propositional logic, the rule of modus ponens states that if the premise \"If A, then B\" is true, and the premise \"A\" is true, then the conclusion \"B\" must be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the premise \"If A, then B\" (If the car was red, then the truck was blue) and the premise \"B\" (The truck was blue), but we do not have the premise \"A\" (The car was red).\n\nTherefore, we cannot apply modus ponens to deduce \"A\" (The car was red) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
