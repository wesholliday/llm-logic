In other words, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and we know that Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince we cannot deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" (P) from the given statements, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given statements \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The affirmed consequent (\"Sue was at the wedding\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (\"Mary was at the wedding\")."
