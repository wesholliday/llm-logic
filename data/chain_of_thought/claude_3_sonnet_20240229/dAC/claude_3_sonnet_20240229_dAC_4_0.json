(Conclusion)\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent,\" which is an invalid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nThe correct form of deductive reasoning for this type of conditional statement is:\nA \u2192 B (Premise 1)\nA (Premise 2)\nTherefore, B (Conclusion)\n\nIn our case, we have B as a premise, but we cannot deduce A from it. The truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A).\n\nAnswer: no"
