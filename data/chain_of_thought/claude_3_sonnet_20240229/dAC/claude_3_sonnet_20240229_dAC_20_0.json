            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is an implication or conditional statement. It has the form:\nIf A (the apple was red), then B (the banana was yellow).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth value of the second statement.\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" is a simple declarative statement, and it is given as true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\nIn propositional logic, the rule of modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can deduce that B is also true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and the information that B is true, but we cannot deduce that A is true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no"
