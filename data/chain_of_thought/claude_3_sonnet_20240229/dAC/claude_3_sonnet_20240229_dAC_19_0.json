It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case, A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nTo deduce the antecedent (A) from a conditional statement and its consequent, we need to apply the rule of affirming the antecedent, which is a valid deductive argument form.\n\nThe argument form is:\nIf A, then B.\nA.\nTherefore, B.\n\nIn our case, we have:\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\nJen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements.\n\nThe reason is that affirming the consequent (Jen watched basketball) in a conditional statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (Tom watched football). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is an invalid argument form.\n\nAnswer: no"
