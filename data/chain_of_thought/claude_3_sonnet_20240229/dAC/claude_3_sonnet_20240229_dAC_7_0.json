In other words, if B is true, we cannot conclude that A is true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot deduce \"Alex finished the race\" from the given statements. The information provided is insufficient to make that conclusion. The truth of \"Chris finished the race\" does not necessarily imply the truth of \"Alex finished the race\" based on the conditional statement alone."
