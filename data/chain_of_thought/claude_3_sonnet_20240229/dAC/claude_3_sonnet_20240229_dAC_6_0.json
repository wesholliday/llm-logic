It states that if the premise is the antecedent (P) of a true conditional statement (If P, then Q), and the consequent (Q) is also given, then we can deduce the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case, we have the consequent (Q) \"Bob chose pasta\" as the premise, and the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we have the consequent (Q) \"Bob chose pasta\" as the premise, and the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" we can apply modus ponens and deduce the antecedent (P) \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
