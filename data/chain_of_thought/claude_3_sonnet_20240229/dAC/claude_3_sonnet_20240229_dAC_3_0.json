This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nIn other words, the fact that \"The book is a mystery novel\" does not necessarily imply that \"The book was written by James.\" There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot deduce \"The book was written by James\" from the given premises. The premises only establish that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, and that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, they do not provide enough information to conclude that James is the author of the book."
