In other words, if we know that \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot conclude that A is necessarily true.\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to B being true, independent of A being true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot deduce \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given statements. The fact that \"Kate ate salad\" is true does not necessarily imply that \"Ben ate pasta\" is also true, based on the conditional statement provided."
