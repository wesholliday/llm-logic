            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\nIf A (the shirt was cotton), then B (the pants were denim).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn deductive logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to deduce the antecedent (A). In other words, from the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\nIf it rains, then the ground will be wet.\nThe ground is wet.\nWe cannot deduce from this that it rained, as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., a sprinkler system, a spill, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, the fact that the pants were denim does not necessarily imply that the shirt was cotton, as there could be other reasons for the pants being denim that are not stated in the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
