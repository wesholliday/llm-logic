            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This statement does not tell us whether A (Lisa bought the red shirt) or B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true or false. It only states that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\nIn deductive logic, affirming the consequent (B) of a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") does not allow us to deduce the truth of the antecedent (A). In other words, from the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
