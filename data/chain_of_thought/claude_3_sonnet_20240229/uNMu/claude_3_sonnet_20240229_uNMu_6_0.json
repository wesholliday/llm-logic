If it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, it means that it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\n2. If it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, then it implies that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
