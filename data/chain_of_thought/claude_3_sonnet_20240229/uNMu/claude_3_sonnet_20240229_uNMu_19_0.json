So the negation means \"It is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser\".\n\n3) This possibility statement is logically equivalent to \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\".\n\nTherefore, the reasoning is valid and we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
