The jacket is draped over the chair.\n2. The jacket is not draped over the chair.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the scenarios based on the given statement.\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" does not rule out either of the two scenarios. It simply states that it is not a requirement for the jacket to be draped over the chair.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the statement does not exclude the possibility of the jacket not being draped over the chair, we can infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
