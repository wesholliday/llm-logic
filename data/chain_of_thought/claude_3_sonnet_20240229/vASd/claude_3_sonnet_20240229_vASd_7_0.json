The premise only states that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. It does not provide any information about the relationship between the pilot light being out and the kitchen being warm.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
