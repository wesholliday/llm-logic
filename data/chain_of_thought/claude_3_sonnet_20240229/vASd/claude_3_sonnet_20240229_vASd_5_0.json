In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, but the conclusion (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q is not necessarily true because the services may not continue if the check bounces, even though the bill is paid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
