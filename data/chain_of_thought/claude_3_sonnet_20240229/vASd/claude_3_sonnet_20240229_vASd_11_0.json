            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\"\nThis can be expressed symbolically as: P \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\nThis can be expressed symbolically as: (P \u2227 R) \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nFor the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must be true whenever the premise is true, regardless of the truth values of the individual statements.\n\nIn this case, the premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (P \u2227 R) \u2192 \u00acQ. It is possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nFor example, if you get enough sleep (P is true) but do hard labor (R is true), you may still be tired (\u00acQ is false), violating the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
