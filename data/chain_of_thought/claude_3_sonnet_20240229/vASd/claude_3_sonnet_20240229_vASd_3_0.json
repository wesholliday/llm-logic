            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If the car is in the garage, then it is safe.\nConclusion: If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\n\nStep 2: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet P = \"The car is in the garage\"\nLet Q = \"It is safe\"\nLet R = \"The garage is flooding\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nConclusion: (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q (If P and R, then Q)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise states that if the car is in the garage, then it is safe. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition, \"the garage is flooding,\" which is not accounted for in the premise.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\nThe conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. Even if the premise is true (if the car is in the garage, then it is safe), it does not guarantee that the conclusion is true (if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe). The flooding condition introduces additional information that is not covered by the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
