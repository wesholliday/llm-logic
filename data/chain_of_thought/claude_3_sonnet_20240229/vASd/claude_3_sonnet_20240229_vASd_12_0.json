The conclusion introduces an additional condition (R: my computer catches on fire) that is not present in the premise.\n\nEven if the premise is true (if I finish my homework, I can play video games), the conclusion does not necessarily follow because the additional condition of the computer catching on fire could prevent me from playing video games, regardless of whether I finished my homework or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
