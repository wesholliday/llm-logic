            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If the match is struck, then it will light.\nConclusion: If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.\n\nStep 2: Represent the premise and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet P = \"The match is struck\"\nLet Q = \"The match will light\"\nLet R = \"The match has been soaked in water\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nConclusion: (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q (If P and R, then Q)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise states that if the match is struck, it will light. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition (the match being soaked in water) to the antecedent (the match being struck).\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\nThe premise does not provide any information about what happens if the match is struck and soaked in water. The conclusion introduces a new condition (R) that is not accounted for in the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. It is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false (e.g., if the match is struck but does not light when soaked in water).\n\nAnswer: no"
