            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\nConclusion: If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise states that a well-written essay is a sufficient condition for getting an A.\nThe conclusion states that a well-written essay, even if turned in late, is a sufficient condition for getting an A.\n\nStep 3: Check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\nThe premise does not specify anything about the condition of turning in the essay late. It only states that a well-written essay is sufficient for getting an A.\nHowever, the conclusion adds an additional condition (turned in late) to the premise.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the conclusion introduces an additional condition that is not present in the premise, it does not necessarily follow from the premise. The conclusion makes a stronger claim than what is supported by the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
