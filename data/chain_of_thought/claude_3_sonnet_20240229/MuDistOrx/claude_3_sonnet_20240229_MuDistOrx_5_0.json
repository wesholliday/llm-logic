            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or on shimble\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options (being on wibble or being on shimble) must be true for the statement to be true. The proposed inference \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it expresses the same disjunctive relationship between the two options. The only difference is that the inference separates the two options into two separate clauses joined by the word \"or,\" but the meaning remains the same.\n\nAnswer: yes"
