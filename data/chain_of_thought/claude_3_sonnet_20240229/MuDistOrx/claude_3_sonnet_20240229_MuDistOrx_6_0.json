            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options (\"gribble a flonk\" or \"gribble a wibble snorkel\") must be true. The proposed inference \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it expresses the same disjunctive relationship between the two options.\n\nAnswer: yes"
