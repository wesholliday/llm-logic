            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The zibber must gronk a quank or gronk a zump crunk' is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two alternatives connected by the word 'or'. The proposed inference 'The zibber must gronk a quank or it must gronk a zump crunk' is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it simply rephrases the second alternative using the pronoun 'it' to refer back to 'The zibber'. This rephrasing does not change the meaning or the logical structure of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
