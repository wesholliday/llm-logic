            "content": "Explanation: The two statements \"The gronk must be wump or be quibble\" and \"The gronk must be wump or it must be quibble\" are logically equivalent. They both express the same idea, which is that the gronk must satisfy one of two conditions: either it is wump, or it is quibble. The second statement simply rephrases the first one by using the pronoun \"it\" to refer back to \"the gronk.\" The logical meaning remains the same.\n\nAnswer: yes"
