            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The quibble must be floob on the froodle or be snork on the zump' uses the conjunction 'or' to connect two alternatives: 'be floob on the froodle' and 'be snork on the zump'. The proposed inference 'The quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump' replaces the second alternative with 'it must be snork on the zump', which has the same meaning as the original. Therefore, the inference preserves the logical meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
