The first statement confirms that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n2. The second statement says, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n3. We know that the consequent (\"the banana was yellow\") is true from the first statement.\n4. However, the truth of the consequent alone does not allow us to infer the truth of the antecedent (\"the apple was red\").\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
