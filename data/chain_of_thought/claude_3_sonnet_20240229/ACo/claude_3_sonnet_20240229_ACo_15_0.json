If the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true. In other words, if \"Erin took a train\" is true, it does not necessarily imply that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\n2. The only way to infer \"Sam took a plane\" from the given statements is if we have additional information that confirms the truth of the antecedent (P) in the conditional statement.\n\nSince we do not have any additional information to confirm that \"Sam took a plane\" is true, we cannot logically infer it from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
