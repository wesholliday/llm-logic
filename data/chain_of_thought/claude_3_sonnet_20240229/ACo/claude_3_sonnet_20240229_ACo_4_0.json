This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn this case, we cannot validly infer \"The alien visited Mars\" from the given premises. The premises only state that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, and that the robot did indeed visit Jupiter. However, there could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter, unrelated to the alien visiting Mars.\n\nAnswer: no"
