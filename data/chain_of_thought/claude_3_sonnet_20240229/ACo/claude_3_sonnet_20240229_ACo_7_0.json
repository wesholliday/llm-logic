This inference is invalid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P).\n\nIn our case, we have \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (If P, then Q) and \"Chris finished the race\" (Q), but we cannot validly infer \"Alex finishes the race\" (P) from these premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
