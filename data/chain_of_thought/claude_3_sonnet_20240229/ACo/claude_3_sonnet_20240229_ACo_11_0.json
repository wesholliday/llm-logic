This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nStep 3: In other words, even though we know that \"the muffins were blueberry\" is true, we cannot conclude that \"the cake was chocolate\" is necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nStep 4: To infer \"the cake was chocolate,\" we would need additional information or premises that directly support that conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"the cake was chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
