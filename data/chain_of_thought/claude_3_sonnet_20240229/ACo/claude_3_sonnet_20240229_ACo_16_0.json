            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"The pants were denim.\"\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the reasoning step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: We know that the consequent (B) of the conditional statement is true because \"The pants were denim\" is given as a separate statement.\n\nStep 2: However, from the truth of the consequent (B), we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nStep 3: In other words, the fact that \"the pants were denim\" does not necessarily imply that \"the shirt was cotton.\" There could be other reasons for the pants being denim, unrelated to the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
