            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- \"The truck was metal.\"\n- \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic,\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and the conclusion.\nPremise: \"The truck was metal.\"\nConclusion: We want to determine if we can infer \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure.\nThe conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not allow us to infer P (the antecedent) from Q (the consequent) alone. In other words, if the consequent (Q) is true, we cannot conclude that the antecedent (P) is also true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nThe given premise \"The truck was metal\" matches the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" However, this alone is not sufficient to infer the antecedent (P), which is \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
