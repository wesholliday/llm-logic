We know that B (the mummy was awake) is true from the first statement.\n2. The conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not allow us to infer A (the vampire was awake) from B being true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
