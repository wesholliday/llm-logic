            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- Statement 1: \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n- Statement 2: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the reasoning step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Q (Sue was at the wedding)\nPremise 2: P \u2192 Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\nConclusion: P (Mary was at the wedding)\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\nIn propositional logic, the argument form \"Q, P \u2192 Q; therefore P\" is not a valid argument form. This means that the conclusion (P) does not necessarily follow from the premises (Q and P \u2192 Q).\n\nThe reason is that the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" only tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about P being true or false when Q is true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not imply the truth of the antecedent (P) in a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given premises \"Sue was at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" The premises do not provide enough information to logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding."
