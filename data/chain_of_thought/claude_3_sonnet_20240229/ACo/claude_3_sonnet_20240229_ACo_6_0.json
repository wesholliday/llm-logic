In other words, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the inference.\nSince we have the premise \"Bob chose pasta\" (Q is true), and the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (P \u2192 Q is true), we cannot validly infer \"Sue chose pizza\" (P is true) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
