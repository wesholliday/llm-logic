            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" is a compound statement consisting of two conditions joined by the conjunction \"and\". For the compound statement to be true, both conditions must be satisfied.\n\nThe first condition is \"The project must have been completed by Friday\", and the second condition is \"under budget\". To infer the first condition from the compound statement, we need to consider the logical implications of the conjunction \"and\".\n\nIf the compound statement is true, it means that both conditions are true. Therefore, if the entire statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" is true, then it logically follows that the first part \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
