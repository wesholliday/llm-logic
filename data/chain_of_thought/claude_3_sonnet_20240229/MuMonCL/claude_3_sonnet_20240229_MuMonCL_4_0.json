            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" and \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\". When we have a conjunction like this, each individual clause is implied to be true. Therefore, from the original statement, we can infer that the first clause \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
