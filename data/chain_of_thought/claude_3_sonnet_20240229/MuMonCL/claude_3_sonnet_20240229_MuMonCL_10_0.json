            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is a compound statement that consists of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". This means that both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nThe first part of the statement is \"The document must have been signed\", and the second part is \"The document must have been notarized\". Since the conjunction \"and\" is used, it implies that both conditions are required.\n\nTherefore, if the entire statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is true, it logically follows that the first part \"The document must have been signed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
