            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is a compound statement consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first part is \"The package must have been delivered today\", and the second part is \"signed for\".\n\nWhen we have a compound statement joined by \"and\", both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is true, then it logically follows that the first part \"The package must have been delivered today\" must also be true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the compound statement implies the truth of each individual part. So, if we know that \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is true, we can validly infer that \"The package must have been delivered today\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
