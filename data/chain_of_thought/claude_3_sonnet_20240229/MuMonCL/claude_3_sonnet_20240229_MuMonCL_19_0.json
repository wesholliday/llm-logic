            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" is a compound sentence consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first part states that \"The application must have been completed online\", while the second part states that it must have \"included references\".\n\nSince the two parts are joined by \"and\", both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. In other words, the application must satisfy both requirements: being completed online and including references.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the statement \"The application must have been completed online\" is true based on the given compound sentence. The first part of the compound sentence directly states this requirement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
