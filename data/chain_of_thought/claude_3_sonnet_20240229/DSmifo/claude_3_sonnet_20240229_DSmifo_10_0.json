If the missing sock is under the bed, then the second premise is satisfied, but it contradicts the first premise, which states that the sock might not be under the bed.\n\n2. If the missing sock is not under the bed, then the first premise is satisfied. For the second premise to be true, the only remaining option is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, by combining the two premises and using logical reasoning, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
