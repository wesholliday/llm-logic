            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The application must have been completed online\" implies \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement, \"The application must have been completed online\", is a specific requirement that the application had to be completed using an online method or platform.\n\nThe second statement, \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically\", introduces an alternative option of submitting the application electronically, in addition to completing it online.\n\nIf the application had to be completed online, then it would also satisfy the condition of being completed online or submitted electronically, since completing it online is one way of submitting it electronically.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is a more specific case of the second statement, and it logically implies the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
