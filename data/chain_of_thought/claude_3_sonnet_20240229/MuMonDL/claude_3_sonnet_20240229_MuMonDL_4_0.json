It does not leave room for the possibility that the meeting was rescheduled from a different time.\n\nThe statement \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled\" introduces an additional possibility that the meeting was rescheduled from a different time to 2 PM. This second statement is broader and more inclusive than the original statement.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we would need additional information or context suggesting that the meeting could have been rescheduled. Without such additional information, the original statement does not necessarily imply or lead to the inference of the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
