            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The event must have been formal\" logically implies \"The event must have been formal or black-tie\", we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement \"The event must have been formal\" asserts that the event had a formal nature or character. The statement \"The event must have been formal or black-tie\" presents two possibilities: either the event was formal or it was black-tie (which is a specific type of formal dress code).\n\nIf an event is black-tie, it is by definition a formal event. Therefore, if the event was black-tie, it would also satisfy the condition of being formal.\n\nSince the second statement includes the possibility of the event being formal, which is already stated in the first statement, the second statement is a broader or more inclusive statement than the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
