            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The exam must have been difficult\" implies that the exam was challenging or not easy. The phrase \"or challenging\" in the second statement is essentially restating or rephrasing the same idea as \"difficult\". Since the second statement includes the original claim of the exam being difficult, and simply adds an alternative way of expressing the same concept, we can infer that the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
