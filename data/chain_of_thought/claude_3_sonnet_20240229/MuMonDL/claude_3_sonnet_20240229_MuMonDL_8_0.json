            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" logically implies \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\", we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is a definite claim that the restaurant was closed on Mondays. This statement does not provide any information about whether the restaurant had limited hours on other days.\n\nThe second statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (being closed on Mondays or having limited hours) must be true.\n\nSince the original statement only confirms that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, it does not necessarily imply that it had limited hours on other days. Therefore, the second statement is broader and includes an additional possibility (having limited hours) that is not explicitly stated or implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
