            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" logically implies \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" sets a deadline for the completion of the project, which is Friday. This statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the project being completed after Friday.\n\nThe second statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week\" introduces an alternative option, which is that the project could be completed next week if it is not completed by Friday.\n\nIf the project is completed by Friday, then both statements are true. However, if the project is not completed by Friday, the original statement becomes false, while the second statement remains true because it allows for the possibility of the project being completed next week.\n\nTherefore, the second statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week\" is a broader statement that encompasses the original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" as well as an additional possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
