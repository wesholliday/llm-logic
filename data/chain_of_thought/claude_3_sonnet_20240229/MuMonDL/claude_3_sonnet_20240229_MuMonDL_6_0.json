            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" implies that all the tickets for the concert were purchased, leaving no more available. The statement \"The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (being sold out or having limited tickets) must be true.\n\nSince the original statement asserts that the concert was sold out, this automatically satisfies the condition of \"being sold out\" in the disjunctive statement. Therefore, the disjunctive statement \"The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets\" is logically true and can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
