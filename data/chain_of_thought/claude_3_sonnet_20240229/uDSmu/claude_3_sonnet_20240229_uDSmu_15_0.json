Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door. (Disjunction)\n2. It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door. (Negation of the second disjunct)\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The shoes are in the closet\"\nLet q = \"The shoes must be lined up by the door\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2228 q (Disjunction)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acq (Negation of q)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nIf we have a disjunction (p \u2228 q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acq), then the other disjunct must be true (p).\n\nThis is known as the Disjunctive Syllogism rule:\n(p \u2228 q) \u2227 \u00acq \u21d2 p\n\nIn our case, we have (p \u2228 q) and \u00acq, so we can infer p, which means \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
