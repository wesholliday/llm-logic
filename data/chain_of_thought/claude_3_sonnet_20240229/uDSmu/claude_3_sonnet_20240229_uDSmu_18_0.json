Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nThis is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\nThis statement negates the second part of the disjunctive statement from Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic.\nIf one part of a disjunctive statement is negated, and the disjunctive statement is true, then the other part must be true.\n\nIn this case, since the second part (\"it must be sitting on the nightstand\") is negated, and the disjunctive statement is true (given in the first statement), the first part (\"the notebook is in the drawer\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
