Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. (Disjunction)\n2. It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. (Negation of the second disjunct)\n\nStep 1: Represent the given information using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\"\nLet q = \"The scarf must be draped on the coat rack\"\n\nThe given information can be represented as:\n1. p \u2228 q (Disjunction)\n2. \u00acq (Negation of the second disjunct)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of propositional logic to derive the conclusion.\nFrom the second statement (\u00acq), we know that q is false.\nSubstituting q = false in the first statement (p \u2228 q), we get:\np \u2228 false\nAccording to the rule of disjunction elimination, if one disjunct is true, the entire disjunction is true.\nTherefore, p must be true, which means \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
