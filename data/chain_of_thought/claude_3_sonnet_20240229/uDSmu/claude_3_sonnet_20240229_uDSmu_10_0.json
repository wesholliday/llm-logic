Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nStep 1: Understand the first statement.\nThe first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true: either the missing sock is in the laundry basket, or it must be under the bed.\n\nStep 2: Understand the second statement.\nThe second statement negates the second part of the disjunctive statement from the first statement. It states that it is not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of the two statements together.\nSince the first statement is a disjunctive statement, and the second statement negates one of the options, the only remaining option must be true.\n\nIf the missing sock is not under the bed (as stated in the second statement), then the only other option from the first statement is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
