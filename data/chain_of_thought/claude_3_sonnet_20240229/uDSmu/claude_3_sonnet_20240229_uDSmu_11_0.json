Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\n2. It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\"\nThis is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\"\nThis statement negates the second option in the disjunctive statement from Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nSince the second option (\"the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\") is negated, and the disjunctive statement states that at least one option must be true, the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
