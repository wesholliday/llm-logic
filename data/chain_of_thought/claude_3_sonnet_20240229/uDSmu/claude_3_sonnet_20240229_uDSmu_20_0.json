Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n2. It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\nLet q = \"The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nStatement 1: p \u2228 q (Either p is true or q is true)\nStatement 2: \u00acq (q is false)\n\nStep 2: Use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion.\nFrom statement 2, we know that q is false (\u00acq).\nSubstituting this into statement 1, we get:\np \u2228 \u00acq\n\nUsing the logical equivalence (p \u2228 \u00acq) \u2261 p, we can conclude that p must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
