We have two statements:\n   a) Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n   b) It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\n2. Statement (a) is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. Statement (b) negates the second part of statement (a), which means that the first part must be true.\n\n4. If the second part of statement (a) is false (as stated in (b)), then the first part must be true by the rules of disjunction.\n\n5. Therefore, if it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
