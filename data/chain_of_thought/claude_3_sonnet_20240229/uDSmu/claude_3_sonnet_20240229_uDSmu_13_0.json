Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\nThis is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\nThis statement negates the second option in the disjunctive statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nSince the second option (\"the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\") is negated, and the disjunctive statement requires at least one option to be true, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
