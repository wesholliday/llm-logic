Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\n2. It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" is the negation of the second part of the disjunctive statement in step 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical inference.\nIf the second part of a disjunctive statement is false, then the first part must be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" is true, it means that \"the pen is in my bag\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
