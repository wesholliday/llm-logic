Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. (Disjunction)\n2. It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. (Negation of the second disjunct)\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises using propositional variables.\nLet p = \"The cat is napping on the couch\"\nLet q = \"The cat must be playing in the bedroom\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2228 q (Disjunction)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Negation of q)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of propositional logic to derive the conclusion.\nFrom premise 2 (\u00acq), we can infer that q is false.\nSince the disjunction (p \u2228 q) is true (premise 1), and q is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if p is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that p is true, which means \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
