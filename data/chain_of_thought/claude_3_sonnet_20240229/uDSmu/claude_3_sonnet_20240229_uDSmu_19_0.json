Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\nThis is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\nThis statement negates the second part of the disjunctive statement in step 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nSince the second part of the disjunctive statement is negated, and at least one part must be true, the only remaining option is that the first part must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
