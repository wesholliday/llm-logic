It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\n2. The first premise is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. The second premise negates one of the options in the first premise, which is \"Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n4. If \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false, then the only remaining option from the first premise is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n5. Since the first premise states that at least one option must be true, and the second premise eliminates one option, the only remaining option is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
