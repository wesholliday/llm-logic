We have two statements:\n   a) Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n   b) It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\n2. Statement (a) is a disjunctive statement, meaning one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. Statement (b) negates the second part of statement (a), which means the first part must be true.\n\n4. If the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then by the disjunctive statement (a), the only other option is that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
