Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. (Disjunction)\n2. It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. (Negation of the second disjunct)\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises using propositional variables.\nLet p = \"The keys are in the drawer\"\nLet q = \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nThe premises can be represented as:\n1. p \u2228 q (Disjunction)\n2. \u00acq (Negation of q)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of propositional logic to derive the conclusion.\nFrom premise 2 (\u00acq), we can infer that q is false.\nSince the disjunction (p \u2228 q) is true (premise 1), and q is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if p is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that p is true, which means \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
