Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n2. It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The book is on the shelf\"\nLet q = \"The book must be resting on the table\"\n\nStatement 1: p \u2228 q (The book is either on the shelf or it must be resting on the table)\nStatement 2: \u00acq (It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nFrom Statement 2 (\u00acq), we can infer that q is false.\nSubstituting q = false in Statement 1 (p \u2228 q), we get:\np \u2228 false\nAccording to the logical rule of disjunction elimination, if one disjunct is true, the entire disjunction is true.\nTherefore, p must be true, which means \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
