It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the apple was red,\" and the consequence is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"the banana was yellow\" from these statements, we need to consider the truth values of the premises.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the truth value of the first premise, \"The apple was red.\"\nThis statement is given as true.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth value of the second premise, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\nThis conditional statement is a premise, so we assume it is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference for conditional statements (modus ponens).\nIf the condition (antecedent) of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence (consequent) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the condition \"the apple was red\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true. Therefore, we can infer that the consequence \"the banana was yellow\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
