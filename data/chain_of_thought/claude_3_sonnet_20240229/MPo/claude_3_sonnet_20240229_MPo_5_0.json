            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n2. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and the consequence is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nNow, we need to consider the truth value of the condition. The first statement tells us that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference for conditional statements, if the condition (antecedent) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, since \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is given as true, we can logically infer that \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
