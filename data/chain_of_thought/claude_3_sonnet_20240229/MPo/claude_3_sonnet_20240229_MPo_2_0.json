It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the griffin was in the forest,\" and the consequence is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThe first statement affirms the condition of the second statement, which means the consequence must also be true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and the conclusion.\nPremise 1: The griffin was in the forest.\nPremise 2: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nStep 2: Apply the rule of inference for conditional statements (modus ponens).\nIf the premise is true and the conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, both the premise (the griffin was in the forest) and the conditional statement (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest) are true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the conclusion \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
