We have the premise \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n2. We have the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n3. The antecedent of the conditional statement (\"Sue chose pizza\") is true (given as a premise).\n4. By applying modus ponens, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent (\"Bob chose pasta\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
