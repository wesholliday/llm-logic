It has the form:\n\nIf [antecedent], then [consequent]\n\nIn this case:\n- Antecedent: \"Joe went to the park\"\n- Consequent: \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\nThe rule of inference for a conditional statement is:\nIf the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nStep 1: Check if the antecedent (\"Joe went to the park\") is true.\nFrom the given premise \"Joe went to the park,\" we know that the antecedent is true.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conditional statement (\"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\") is true.\nWe are given this conditional statement as a premise, so we assume it is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference.\nSince the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the consequent (\"Lucy went to the zoo\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
