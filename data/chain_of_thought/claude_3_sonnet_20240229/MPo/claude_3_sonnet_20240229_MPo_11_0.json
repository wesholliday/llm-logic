It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the cake was chocolate,\" and the consequence is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The muffins were blueberry\" from the given statements, we need to check if the condition of the conditional statement is true.\n\nThe first statement, \"The cake was chocolate,\" confirms that the condition of the conditional statement is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference for conditional statements, if the condition is true, then we can infer that the consequence is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
