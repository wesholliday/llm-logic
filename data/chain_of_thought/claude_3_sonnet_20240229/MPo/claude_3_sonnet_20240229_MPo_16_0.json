The antecedent (P): \"The shirt was cotton\" is true (given).\n2. The conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true (given).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the consequent (Q): \"The pants were denim\" is also true.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The shirt was cotton (given).\n2. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (given).\n3. The antecedent of the conditional statement (the shirt was cotton) is true.\n4. According to the rules of inference, if the antecedent is true and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
