It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequence is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe first statement confirms that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
