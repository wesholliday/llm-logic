It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the bear was in the cave,\" and the consequence is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nNow, we need to consider the truth value of the condition, which is given by the first statement: \"The bear was in the cave.\" Since this statement is true, we can apply the rule of inference known as modus ponens (or affirming the antecedent).\n\nModus ponens states that if the condition (antecedent) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can infer that \"the wolf was in the den\" is true.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement, \"The bear was in the cave,\" is given as true.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n3. The condition (antecedent) of the conditional statement, \"the bear was in the cave,\" is true (from the first statement).\n4. By applying modus ponens, if the condition is true, then the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"the wolf was in the den\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
