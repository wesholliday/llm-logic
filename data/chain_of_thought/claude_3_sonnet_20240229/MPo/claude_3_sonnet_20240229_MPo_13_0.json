It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the car was red,\" and the consequence is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The truck was blue\" from the given statements, we need to check if the condition of the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the condition \"the car was red.\"\nThe first statement, \"The car was red,\" directly confirms that the condition is true.\n\nStep 2: Apply the rule of inference for conditional statements.\nIf the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence is also true.\n\nSince the condition \"the car was red\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is given as true, we can infer that the consequence \"the truck was blue\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
