It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Alex finished the race,\" and the consequence is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe rule of inference for a conditional statement is called \"modus ponens,\" which states:\n\nIf the condition (antecedent) is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 1: Verify that the condition (antecedent) \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\nThis is given as a premise, so it is true.\n\nStep 2: Verify that the conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true.\nThis is also given as a premise, so it is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of modus ponens.\nSince the condition (antecedent) is true, and the conditional statement is true, the consequence (consequent) \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
