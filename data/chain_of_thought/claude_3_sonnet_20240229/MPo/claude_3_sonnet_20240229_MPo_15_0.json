It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Sam took a plane,\" and the consequence is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nNow, we need to consider the truth value of the condition. The first statement, \"Sam took a plane,\" affirms that the condition is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement.\n2. The condition \"Sam took a plane\" is affirmed to be true by the statement \"Sam took a plane.\"\n3. If the condition of a conditional statement is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the consequence \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
