It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the alien visited Mars,\" and the consequence is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer the consequence from the given statements, we need to check if the condition is true.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the condition \"the alien visited Mars.\"\nFrom the first statement, we know that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true.\n\nStep 2: Apply the rule of inference for conditional statements.\nIf the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer the consequence.\n\nIn this case, the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is given as true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the consequence \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
