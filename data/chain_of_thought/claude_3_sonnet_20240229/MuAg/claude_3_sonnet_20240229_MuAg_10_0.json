            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized\" consists of two separate clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\". Each clause makes a separate claim about the requirements for the document.\n\nThe first clause \"The document must have been signed\" states that signing the document is a requirement.\n\nThe second clause \"it must have been notarized\" states that notarization of the document is also a requirement, using the pronoun \"it\" to refer back to the document.\n\nBy combining these two clauses into one statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\", we are not introducing any new information or changing the meaning. We are simply rephrasing the original statement in a more concise way by removing the repeated reference to \"the document\" and the redundant use of \"must have been\".\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" accurately captures the requirements conveyed by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
