            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references\" consists of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\":\n\n1. \"The application must have been completed online\"\n2. \"it must have included references\"\n\nThe pronoun \"it\" in the second part refers back to \"The application\" in the first part. So, the two parts are essentially saying the same thing, just with the second part using a pronoun instead of repeating \"The application\".\n\nBy removing the pronoun \"it\" and combining the two parts, we get the statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\", which has the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
