            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The exam must have been difficult and it must have covered all chapters\" contains two separate claims connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n\n1. \"The exam must have been difficult\"\n2. \"It must have covered all chapters\"\n\nThe second part, \"it must have covered all chapters,\" uses the pronoun \"it\" to refer back to \"the exam.\" So, the two claims are essentially saying:\n\n1. The exam must have been difficult\n2. The exam must have covered all chapters\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. The only difference is that the second part does not use the pronoun \"it,\" but directly states \"covered all chapters\" instead.\n\nAnswer: yes"
