            "content": "Explanation: In the given statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and it must have been under budget\", there are two separate conditions connected by the conjunction \"and\". The first condition is \"The project must have been completed by Friday\", and the second condition is \"it must have been under budget\".\n\nTo infer the statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget\", we need to ensure that both conditions are still present and their meanings are preserved.\n\nIn the original statement, the pronoun \"it\" in the second condition refers back to \"The project\" mentioned in the first condition. Therefore, the two conditions are referring to the same project.\n\nWhen we combine the two conditions into one statement using \"and\", we are essentially saying that both conditions must be true for the same project.\n\nAnswer: yes"
