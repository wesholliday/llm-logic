            "content": "Explanation: The two statements \"The book must be on the shelf and it must have a red cover\" and \"The book must be on the shelf and have a red cover\" are logically equivalent. The use of \"it\" in the first statement refers back to \"the book\", so the meaning is the same as the second statement where \"it\" is omitted. Both statements express the same two conditions: 1) the book must be on the shelf, and 2) the book must have a red cover. The conjunction \"and\" connects these two conditions in both cases.\n\nAnswer: yes"
