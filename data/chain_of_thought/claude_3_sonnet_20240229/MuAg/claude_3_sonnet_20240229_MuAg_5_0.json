            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for\" consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\":\n\n1. \"The package must have been delivered today\"\n2. \"It must have been signed for\"\n\nThe second part, \"it must have been signed for,\" refers back to the package mentioned in the first part. Therefore, the statement is essentially saying that the package must have been delivered today, and it (the same package) must have been signed for.\n\nTo infer \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" we need to combine the two parts into a single statement without changing the meaning. By removing the repetition of \"it\" and connecting the two parts with \"and,\" we arrive at the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
