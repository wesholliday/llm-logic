            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The movie must have been in English and it must have had subtitles\" consists of two separate clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\":\n\n1. \"The movie must have been in English\"\n2. \"It must have had subtitles\"\n\nThe second part, \"it must have had subtitles,\" refers back to the movie mentioned in the first part. Therefore, the two clauses are referring to the same movie.\n\nWhen we remove the word \"it\" from the second clause, the meaning remains the same. The statement \"The movie must have been in English and had subtitles\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it still conveys that the movie was in English and had subtitles.\n\nAnswer: yes"
