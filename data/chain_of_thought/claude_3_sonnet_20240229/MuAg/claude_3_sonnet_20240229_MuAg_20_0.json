            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event must have been formal and it must have required tickets\" consists of two separate clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\":\n\n1. \"The event must have been formal\"\n2. \"It must have required tickets\"\n\nThe pronoun \"it\" in the second clause refers back to \"the event\" in the first clause. Therefore, the two clauses are essentially saying the same thing, just with the second clause using a pronoun instead of repeating \"the event\".\n\nTo infer \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\", we need to combine the two clauses into a single statement without the pronoun \"it\". This can be done by simply removing \"it\" from the second clause and joining the two clauses with \"and\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
