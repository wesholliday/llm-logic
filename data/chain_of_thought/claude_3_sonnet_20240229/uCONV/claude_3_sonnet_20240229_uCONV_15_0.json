Just because the given statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the converse \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" is also true.\n\nThere could be other scenarios where Erin took a train, but Sam did not take a plane. For example, Sam could have taken a bus or a car, or he might not have traveled at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
