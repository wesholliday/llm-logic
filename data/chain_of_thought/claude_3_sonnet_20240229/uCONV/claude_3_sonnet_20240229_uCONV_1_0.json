The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the converse.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the specific case.\nIn this case, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" (S \u2192 M) from the given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (M \u2192 S).\n\nAnswer: no"
