In other words, if P \u2192 Q is true, it does not necessarily imply that Q \u2192 P is also true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the specific case.\nThe question asks if we can infer that \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" from the given statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe converse of the given statement is: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
