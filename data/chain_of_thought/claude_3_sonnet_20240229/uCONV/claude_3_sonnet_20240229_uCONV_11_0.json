The converse can be true or false, depending on the truth values of the component propositions.\n\nStep 3: To determine if the converse is logically equivalent, we need to consider the truth table for the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and its converse (q \u2192 p).\n\np | q | p \u2192 q | q \u2192 p\n--+---+-------+-------\nT | T |   T   |   T\nT | F |   F   |   F\nF | T |   T   |   T\nF | F |   T   |   T\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and its converse (q \u2192 p) have different truth values in the second row (when p is true and q is false).\n\nTherefore, the converse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
