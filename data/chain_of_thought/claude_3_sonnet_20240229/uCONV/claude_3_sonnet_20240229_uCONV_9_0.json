In other words, if A \u2192 B is true, it does not necessarily imply that B \u2192 A is also true.\n\nIn this case, the converse statement would be: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nThe given statement only states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not provide any information about whether the reverse is also true.\n\nIt is possible that Mark bought the blue shirt for a different reason, unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
