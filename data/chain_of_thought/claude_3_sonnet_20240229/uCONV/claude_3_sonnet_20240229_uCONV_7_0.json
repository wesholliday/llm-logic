The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" The converse of this statement, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race, based solely on the given statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement."
