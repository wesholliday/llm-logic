It is possible that Kate ate salad for reasons other than Ben eating pasta.\n\nFor example, if Ben did not eat pasta, but Kate still ate salad, the converse statement would be false.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the converse statement is logically valid or not.\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true unless there is additional information or constraints that establish a one-to-one correspondence between the hypothesis and conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
