The truth of \"If A, then B\" does not imply the truth of \"If B, then A.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1) The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2) The inference we want to make is the converse of the given statement, which has the form \"If B, then A.\"\n3) In propositional logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.\n4) Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
