The truth of A \u2192 B does not imply the truth of B \u2192 A.\n\nIn this case, the given statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" does not guarantee that \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave\" is true.\n\nThere could be other reasons for the wolf to be in the den, independent of the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no"
