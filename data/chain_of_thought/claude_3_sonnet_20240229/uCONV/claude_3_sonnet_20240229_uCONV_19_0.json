However, it does not necessarily imply that Tom watching football is a necessary condition for Jen watching basketball.\n\nIn other words, Jen watching basketball could have occurred due to other reasons, not necessarily because Tom watched football.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the converse statement is logically valid.\nThe converse statement is not logically valid because it assumes that the only reason for Jen watching basketball is if Tom watched football, which is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
