Just because the pants were denim does not necessarily imply that the shirt was cotton. There could be other possibilities, such as the shirt being made of a different material like polyester or silk.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe converse of the given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is not valid. We cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton."
