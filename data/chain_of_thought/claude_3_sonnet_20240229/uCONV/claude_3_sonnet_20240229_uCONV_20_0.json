            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the two statements: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nStep 1: Represent the given statement using propositional logic.\nLet A = \"The apple was red\"\nLet B = \"The banana was yellow\"\n\nThe given statement is: \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\nThe statement A \u2192 B does not imply that B \u2192 A is also true. In other words, the truth of the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily mean that the converse statement \"If B, then A\" is also true.\n\nStep 3: Consider a counterexample.\nSuppose there is a green apple and a yellow banana. In this case, A (the apple was red) is false, and B (the banana was yellow) is true. However, the conditional statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" (B \u2192 A) is false because the antecedent (B) is true, but the consequent (A) is false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nBased on the analysis, we cannot infer that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" is true from the given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
