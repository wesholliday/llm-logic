However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the snork might also have the property of being zibble.\n\nTo infer 'The snork might be zibble and plimp' from the given statement, we would need additional information indicating that it is possible for the snork to be zibble as well as plimp. Without such additional information, we cannot logically conclude that the snork might possess both properties simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no"
