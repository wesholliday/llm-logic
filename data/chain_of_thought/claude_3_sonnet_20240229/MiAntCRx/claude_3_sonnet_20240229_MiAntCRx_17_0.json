The original statement only suggests the possibility of 'glorp' being 'bimboozle', but it does not mention anything about 'shimble'. To infer the second statement, we would need additional information or context indicating that 'glorp' can be both 'shimble' and 'bimboozle' simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no"
