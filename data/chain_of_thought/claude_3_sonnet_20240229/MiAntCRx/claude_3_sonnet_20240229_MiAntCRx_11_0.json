The original statement only suggests that 'The bimboozle' has the possibility of being 'wumble', but it does not mention or imply anything about 'quazzle'. Without additional context or information, it would be an unsupported inference to claim that 'The bimboozle' might be both 'quazzle' and 'wumble'.\n\nAnswer: no"
