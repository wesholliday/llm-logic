In other words, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true.\n\nHowever, if we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is true based on the conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, we know that Q (\"the flugel was zargled\") is true from Statement 1. But we cannot infer from this that P (\"the flugel was blimmed\") is true, based on Statement 2 alone.\n\nAnswer: No"
