This means that if the condition A (\"the splat was morphed\") is true, then the consequence B (\"the splat was quanked\") must also be true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the consequence B does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition A. In other words, from the fact that \"the splat was quanked\", we cannot infer that \"the splat was morphed\".\n\nThere could be other reasons or conditions that led to \"the splat was quanked\", besides \"the splat was morphed\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"the splat was morphed\".\n\nAnswer: no"
