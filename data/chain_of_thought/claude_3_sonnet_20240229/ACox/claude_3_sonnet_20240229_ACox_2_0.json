It states that if the condition \"the wug was flooped\" (A) is true, then the consequence \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" (B) must also be true.\n\nWe know from the first premise that \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" (B) is true.\n\nIn a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", if the consequent B is true, we can infer that either the antecedent A is true or the conditional statement is false.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have no information to suggest that the conditional statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is false.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the antecedent \"the wug was flooped\" (A) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
