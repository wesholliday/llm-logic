It does not assert whether A is true or false.\n\n4) However, if we know that B is true, and we know the conditional \"If A then B\" is true, then we can infer that A must also be true.\n\n5) In this case, we know that B (\"the whiffle tinked\") is true from Premise 1.\n6) And we know the conditional \"If A then B\" is true from Premise 2.\n\n7) Therefore, following the logic, we can validly infer that A (\"the whiffle was shanked\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
