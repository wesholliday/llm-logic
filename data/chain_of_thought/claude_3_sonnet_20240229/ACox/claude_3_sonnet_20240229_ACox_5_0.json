The truth of the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily imply that P is true.\n\nTo infer that P is true, we would need an additional premise that states that the conditional statement is a biconditional (if and only if) statement.\n\nWithout this additional information, we cannot logically infer that \"The zinger was fraggled\" is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
