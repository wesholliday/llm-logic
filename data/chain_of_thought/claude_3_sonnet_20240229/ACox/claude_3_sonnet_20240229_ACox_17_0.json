Use the rules of inference to determine if the conclusion follows\n\nThe given statements are:\n\"The whiffle was tinked\"\n\"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle was tinked\"\n\nWe can represent these symbolically as:\nP: \"The whiffle was tinked\" \nQ \u2192 P: \"If the whiffle was shanked (Q), then the whiffle was tinked (P)\"\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer Q (\"The whiffle was shanked\") from the premises.\n\nIn propositional logic, the only way to infer Q from Q \u2192 P and P is through the rule of modus ponens, which states:\nIf Q \u2192 P is true, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we only know P is true and Q \u2192 P is true. We cannot infer Q is true from just those premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
