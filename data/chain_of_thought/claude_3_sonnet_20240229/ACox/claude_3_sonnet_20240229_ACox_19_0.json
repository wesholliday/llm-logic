If P, then Q (the conditional statement)\n2. Q (the consequent is true)\nThen we can conclude P (the antecedent must be true).\n\nIn our case, we have:\n1. \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" (the conditional statement)\n2. \"The twonk was varnished.\" (the consequent is true)\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, we can infer:\nAnswer: yes\n\nThe twonk was plinked."
