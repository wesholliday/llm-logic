This means that if the condition A (\"the splat was morphed\") is true, then the consequence B (\"the splat quanked\") must also be true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the consequence B does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition A. In other words, the fact that \"the splat quanked\" does not necessarily mean that \"the splat was morphed\".\n\nThere could be other reasons or conditions that led to \"the splat quanked\", besides \"the splat was morphed\".\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer or conclude that \"the splat was morphed\".\n\nAnswer: no"
