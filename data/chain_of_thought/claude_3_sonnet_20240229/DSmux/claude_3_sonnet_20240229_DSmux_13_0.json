(Symbolically: p \u2228 q)\n2. It's not the case that the glip must be tragged. (Symbolically: \u00acq)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The glip is slogged\" (p) from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the first premise using the logical equivalence (p \u2228 q) \u2261 (\u00acp \u2192 q).\n(p \u2228 q) \u2261 (\u00acp \u2192 q)\np \u2228 q \u2261 \u00acp \u2192 q\n\nStep 2: Substitute the premises into the equivalence.\n\u00acp \u2192 q (from the first premise)\n\u00acq (from the second premise)\n\nStep 3: Use the rule of modus tollens (if p \u2192 q and \u00acq, then \u00acp).\nIf \u00acp \u2192 q (from the first premise) and \u00acq (from the second premise), then \u00ac\u00acp (which is equivalent to p).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The glip is slogged\" (p) from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
