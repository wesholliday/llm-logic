One of these must be true.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can eliminate the possibility that the smip is lupped. If the smip was lupped, it would contradict the first statement that says it might not be lupped.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
