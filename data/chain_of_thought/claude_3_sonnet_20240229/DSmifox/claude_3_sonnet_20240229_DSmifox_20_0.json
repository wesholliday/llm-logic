So Premise 1 can be written as:\n\u00ac(The fleeg is surned)\n\nPremise 2 is a disjunction (OR) of two propositions:\n(The fleeg is surned) \u2228 (The fleeg is bluttered)\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from these premises, we need to use the rules of inference in propositional logic.\n\nOne such rule is the Disjunctive Syllogism:\nIf we have (A \u2228 B) and \u00acA, then we can infer B.\n\nApplying this rule to our premises:\n(The fleeg is surned) \u2228 (The fleeg is bluttered) [Premise 2]\n\u00ac(The fleeg is surned) [Premise 1]\nTherefore, we can infer (The fleeg is bluttered)\n\nAnswer: yes"
