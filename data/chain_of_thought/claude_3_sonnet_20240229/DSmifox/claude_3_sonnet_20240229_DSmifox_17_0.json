These two conditions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n\nNow, Premise 1 tells us that the flob might not be movated. In other words, it is possible that the flob is not movated.\n\nIf the flob is not movated, then according to Premise 2, the only other possibility is that it is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
