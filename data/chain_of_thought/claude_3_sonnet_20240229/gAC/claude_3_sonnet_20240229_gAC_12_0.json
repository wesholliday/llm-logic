This would be an invalid inference known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent.\"\n\nHowever, if we know that the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and we also know that B is true, we can validly infer that A must be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 3: Apply the modus ponens rule.\nIn our case, we know that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true (the conditional statement), and we also know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true (the consequent).\n\nTherefore, by the modus ponens rule, we can validly infer that \"Joe went to the park\" (the antecedent) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
