It does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given statements \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter\" do not logically imply that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises."
