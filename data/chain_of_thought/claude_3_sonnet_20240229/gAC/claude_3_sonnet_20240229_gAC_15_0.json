In other words, knowing that \"Erin took a train\" is true does not necessarily imply that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given information does not allow us to conclude with certainty that \"Sam took a plane\" is true. It is possible that Sam did not take a plane, and Erin took a train for some other reason."
