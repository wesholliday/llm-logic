            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (Conditional statement)\n2. \"Jen watched basketball\" (Simple statement)\n\nWe want to determine if \"Tom watched football\" is true based on these statements.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the conditional statement.\nThe conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be represented as:\nP \u2192 Q\nWhere P is \"Tom watched football,\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, the conditional statement P \u2192 Q does not allow us to infer P (the antecedent) from Q (the consequent) alone. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nHowever, if we have the conditional statement P \u2192 Q and the antecedent P is true, then we can infer that the consequent Q is true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nIn our case, we have the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent \"Jen watched basketball\" (Q) is true.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion.\nSince we have the conditional statement P \u2192 Q and the consequent Q is true, we cannot infer that the antecedent P (\"Tom watched football\") is true. The truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent in a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
