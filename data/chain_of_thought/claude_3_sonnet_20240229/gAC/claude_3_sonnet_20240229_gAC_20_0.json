In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince affirming the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" is necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
