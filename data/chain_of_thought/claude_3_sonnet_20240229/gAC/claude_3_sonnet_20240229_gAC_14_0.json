There is a possibility that A is false, and B is true for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given information does not allow us to conclude with certainty that \"The bear was in the cave\" is true. While the conditional statement and the truth of \"The wolf was in the den\" are known, affirming the consequent does not logically imply the truth of the antecedent."
