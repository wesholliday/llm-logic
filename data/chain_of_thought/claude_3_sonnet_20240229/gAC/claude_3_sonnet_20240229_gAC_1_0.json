In other words, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince affirming the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent, we cannot conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
