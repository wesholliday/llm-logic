            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true.\n- \"The pants were denim\" is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \"The shirt was cotton\" is necessarily true based on these premises.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement, \"The pants were denim.\"\nThis statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the truth of the antecedent. In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, we cannot conclude that A is necessarily true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer the truth of \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given premises, it does not necessarily follow that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
