This is because the truth of the consequent (q) does not imply the truth of the antecedent (p) in a conditional statement.\n\nIn other words, the fact that \"the mummy was awake\" does not necessarily mean that \"the vampire was awake,\" even if the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
