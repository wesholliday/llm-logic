The truth of the consequent does not imply the truth of the antecedent in a conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclusively determine whether \"The dog was inside\" is true or not. The truth of \"The cat was outside\" does not guarantee the truth of \"The dog was inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
