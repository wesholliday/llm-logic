            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n- \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is necessarily true based on these premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\n\"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth values of the premises.\nThe first premise, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" is true.\nThe second premise, \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" is also true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the consequent (B) as true, but we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (A) from a true conditional statement. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nEven though \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, we cannot logically conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is necessarily true. The truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent in a conditional statement."
