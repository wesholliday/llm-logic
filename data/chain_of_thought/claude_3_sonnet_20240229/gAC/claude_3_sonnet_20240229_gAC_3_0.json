The truth of (p \u2192 q) does not imply the truth of (q \u2192 p).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion based on the given information.\nWe know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" (q) is true, but we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James\" (p) is true based solely on the given statements.\n\nThere could be other authors who write mystery novels, and the fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean it was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
