This is because the truth of the consequent (q) does not imply the truth of the antecedent (p) in a conditional statement.\n\nIn other words, the truth of \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The unicorn was in the forest\" does not guarantee that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
