In other words, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion based on the given premises.\nSince affirming the consequent (\"Amy played tennis\") does not logically imply the truth of the antecedent (\"Jeff played basketball\"), we cannot conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" is necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
