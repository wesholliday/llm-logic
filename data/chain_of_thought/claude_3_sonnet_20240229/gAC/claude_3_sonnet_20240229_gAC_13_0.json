            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true.\n- \"The truck was blue\" is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \"The car was red\" is necessarily true based on these premises.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first premise, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the car was red,\" and B is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise, \"The truck was blue.\"\nThis statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule of inference.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent. In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, it does not necessarily follow that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion based on the given premises.\nSince affirming the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent, we cannot conclude that \"The car was red\" is necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
