The truth of the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and the premise \"The muffins were blueberry\" do not guarantee the truth of \"The cake was chocolate.\" There could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry, unrelated to the cake being chocolate."
