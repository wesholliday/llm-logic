If the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must be true. However, if the consequent (q) is true, it does not necessarily imply that the antecedent (p) is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement p \u2192 q and the truth of the consequent q. However, we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent p from these premises alone. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe truth of \"Lucy went to the zoo\" does not necessarily imply that \"Joe went to the park\" is true. There could be other reasons or circumstances that led to Lucy going to the zoo, independent of whether Joe went to the park or not."
