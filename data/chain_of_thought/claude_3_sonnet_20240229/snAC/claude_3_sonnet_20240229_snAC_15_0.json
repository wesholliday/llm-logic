However, we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent \"Sam took a plane\" from this information alone.\n\nThe truth of the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily imply the truth of A (the antecedent). It only guarantees the truth of B (the consequent) if A is true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given information does not necessarily imply that \"Sam took a plane\" is true. It is possible that Erin took a train for some other reason, and Sam did not take a plane."
