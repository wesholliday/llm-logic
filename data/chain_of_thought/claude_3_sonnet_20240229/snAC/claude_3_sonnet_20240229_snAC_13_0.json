This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and the truth of the consequent (q) do not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (p).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given premises do not necessarily imply that \"The car was red\" is true. It is possible that the car was not red, but some other condition led to the truck being blue. The premises are not sufficient to conclude that the car was red."
