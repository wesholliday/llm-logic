In this case, the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true (because the antecedent is false), and \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, but \"Tom watched football\" is false.\n\nThis counterexample demonstrates that the conclusion \"Tom watched football\" does not necessarily follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
