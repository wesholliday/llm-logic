A \u2192 B (If A is true, then B is true)\n2. B (B is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implication statement (A \u2192 B).\nThe implication A \u2192 B is false only when A is true and B is false. In all other cases, the implication is true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth value of the conclusion (A) based on the given statements.\nSince B is true (from statement 2), the implication A \u2192 B (from statement 1) cannot be false. However, this does not necessarily mean that A (the alien visited Mars) must be true.\n\nThe truth of the implication A \u2192 B does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (A) when the consequent (B) is true. It only guarantees that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclusively determine whether \"The alien visited Mars\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
