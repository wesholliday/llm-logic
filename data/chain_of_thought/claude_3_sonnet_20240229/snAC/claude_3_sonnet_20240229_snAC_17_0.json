This is because there could be other reasons or conditions that led to Q being true, independent of P.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given premises do not necessarily imply that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true. Even though \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true, and \"Kate ate salad\" is true, it is possible that Ben did not eat pasta, and Kate ate salad for some other reason."
