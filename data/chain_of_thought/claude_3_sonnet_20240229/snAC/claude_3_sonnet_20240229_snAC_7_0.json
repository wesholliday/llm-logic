However, we do not have A (Alex finished the race) as a premise.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical implication.\nThe conditional statement A \u2192 C does not imply that A is true. It only states that if A is true, then C must also be true. However, if C is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent (C) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given premises, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race,\" do not necessarily imply that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. The truth of the consequent (Chris finished the race) does not logically guarantee the truth of the antecedent (Alex finished the race) in a conditional statement."
