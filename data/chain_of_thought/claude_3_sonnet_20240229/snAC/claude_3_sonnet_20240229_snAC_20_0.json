It means that if the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of p when q is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, the truth of the consequent (q) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (p) in an implication (p \u2192 q). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\nIf we know that \"The ground is wet,\" we cannot conclude that \"It rained\" because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (e.g., a sprinkler system).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nIn the given problem, even though \"The banana was yellow\" (q) is true, and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (p \u2192 q) is true, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" (p) is necessarily true. There could be other reasons for the banana to be yellow that are not related to the color of the apple."
