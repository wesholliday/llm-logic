This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo infer \"p\" from \"p \u2192 q\" and \"q,\" we need an additional premise, which is the converse of the conditional statement, \"q \u2192 p\" (If q is true, then p is true).\n\nHowever, in this case, we do not have the converse premise \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion.\nSince we do not have the necessary premise to infer \"p\" (The book was written by James) from the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
