In this case, the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" would still be true (because the antecedent is false), and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" would also be true. However, \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" would be false.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given information does not necessarily imply that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true. The truth of the conditional statement and the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent in propositional logic."
