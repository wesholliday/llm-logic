However, we can use the law of contrapositive to reason about the truth value of p.\n\nThe contrapositive of the conditional statement \"p \u2192 q\" is \"\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\" (If not q, then not p).\n\nSince q is true (the unicorn was in the forest), its negation \u00acq is false.\n\nAccording to the contrapositive rule, if the premise \"\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\" is true and \u00acq is false, then \u00acp must also be false.\n\nTherefore, if \u00acp is false, then p must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
