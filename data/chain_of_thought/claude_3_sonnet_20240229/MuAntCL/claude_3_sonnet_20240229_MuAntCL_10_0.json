The statement only asserts that the signing of the document was required or necessary, but it does not provide any information about whether notarization was also required.\n\nNotarization is a separate process from signing a document, where a public official (a notary) witnesses the signing and certifies the authenticity of the signatures. While some important documents may require both signing and notarization, the given statement does not explicitly state or imply that notarization was also necessary.\n\nTo infer that the document must have been notarized, the statement would need to explicitly mention notarization or use language that clearly encompasses both signing and notarization as requirements.\n\nAnswer: no"
