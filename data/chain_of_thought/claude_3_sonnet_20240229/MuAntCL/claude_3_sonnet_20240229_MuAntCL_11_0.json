Updating software and restarting it are two separate actions, and the given statement only mentions the update part.\n\nTo infer that the software was restarted, we would need additional information or context suggesting that restarting is a necessary step after updating the software. Without such additional information, we cannot make the inference that the software was restarted based solely on the statement that it must have been updated.\n\nAnswer: no"
