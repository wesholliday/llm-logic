It only states that the room must have been cleaned on a daily basis.\n\nTo infer that the room \"must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels\", we would need additional information or context suggesting that the provision of fresh towels is a necessary part of the daily cleaning process for that particular room or establishment.\n\nWithout any additional context or information, we cannot logically infer the inclusion of fresh towels from the original statement alone. The original statement is limited to the requirement of daily cleaning, and does not extend to any other specific tasks or amenities.\n\nAnswer: no"
