It only specifies the time when the meeting must have taken place. To infer that the meeting was in the conference room, we would need additional information or context that explicitly states or implies the location.\n\nWithout any additional context or information provided, we cannot logically infer that the meeting was in the conference room based solely on the given statement about the time. The statement does not provide enough information to make that additional inference about the location.\n\nAnswer: no"
