The phrase \"must have been delivered\" indicates that the package arrived at its destination on the previous day, but it does not provide any information about whether someone signed for it or not.\n\nTo infer that the package was signed for, there would need to be additional information or context suggesting that a signature was required or obtained upon delivery. Without any explicit mention of a signature or sign-off process, we cannot make that inference from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
