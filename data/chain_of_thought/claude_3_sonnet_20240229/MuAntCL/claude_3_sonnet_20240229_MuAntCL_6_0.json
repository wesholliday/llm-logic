It only suggests that all the tickets for the concert were sold, but it does not imply or state anything about when the concert started.\n\nTo infer \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM,\" we would need additional information explicitly stating or implying the start time of 8 PM. Without that additional information, we cannot logically conclude the second part of the statement about the start time from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
