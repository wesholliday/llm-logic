It only states that the application had to be completed online, but does not provide any additional information about what the application must have included or not included.\n\nTo infer that \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or context indicating that references were a required part of the online application process. Without such additional information, we cannot make that inference based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
