It only states that the restaurant was closed on Monday.\n\nTo infer that \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday and served Italian cuisine,\" we would need additional information explicitly stating that the restaurant serves Italian cuisine. Without this additional information, we cannot make the inference that the restaurant served Italian cuisine based solely on the given statement about it being closed on Monday.\n\nAnswer: No"
