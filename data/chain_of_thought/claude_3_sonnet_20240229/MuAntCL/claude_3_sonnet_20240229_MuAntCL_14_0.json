It only states that the contract had to be valid or in effect for a duration of one year.\n\nTo infer that the contract was renewable, there needs to be additional information or context provided in the original statement. Without any such additional details, we cannot make the assumption that the contract was renewable based solely on the information that it had to be valid for a year.\n\nAnswer: No"
