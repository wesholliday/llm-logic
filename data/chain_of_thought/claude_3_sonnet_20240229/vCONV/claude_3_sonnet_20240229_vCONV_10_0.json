            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and conclusion, and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven:\nPremise: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nConclusion: If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements symbolically.\nLet p = \"The dog was inside\"\nLet q = \"The cat was outside\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nThe conclusion can be written as: q \u2192 p (If q, then p)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise: p \u2192 q\nConclusion: q \u2192 p\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Contrapositive\" in propositional logic.\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive form is logically valid.\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the premise (p \u2192 q) is true, then the conclusion (q \u2192 p) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
