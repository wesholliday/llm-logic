            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nConclusion: If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nStep 2: Represent the premise and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet P = \"The car was red\"\nLet Q = \"The truck was blue\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nConclusion: Q \u2192 P (If Q, then P)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nP \u2192 Q\n\u2234 Q \u2192 P\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Converse\" and is not logically valid.\n\nStep 4: Explain the reasoning.\nThe premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (P \u2192 Q) does not necessarily imply the conclusion \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" (Q \u2192 P). The premise only states that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue, but it does not guarantee that if the truck is blue, then the car must be red.\n\nThere could be other scenarios where the truck is blue, but the car is not red. For example, if both the car and the truck were blue, the premise would still be true, but the conclusion would be false.\n\nAnswer: no"
