However, it does not imply the converse (Q \u2192 P), which is the conclusion.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the shirt being cotton implies the pants being denim does not necessarily mean that the pants being denim implies the shirt being cotton.\n\nThere could be other reasons or conditions that lead to the pants being denim, without the shirt being cotton.\n\nAnswer: no"
