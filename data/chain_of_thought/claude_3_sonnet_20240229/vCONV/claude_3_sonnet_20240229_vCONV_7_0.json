            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven:\nPremise: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nConclusion: If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet A = \"Alex finished the race\"\nLet C = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\nPremise: A \u2192 C (If A is true, then C is true)\nConclusion: C \u2192 A (If C is true, then A is true)\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\nThe premise (A \u2192 C) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (C \u2192 A). The premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it does not imply the converse, which is that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nStep 3: Consider counterexamples.\nA counterexample would be a situation where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. For instance, if Alex did not finish the race (A is false), and Chris did finish the race (C is true), then the premise (A \u2192 C) would be true (since the conditional statement is true when the antecedent is false), but the conclusion (C \u2192 A) would be false.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nThe given argument form is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" does not logically imply the conclusion \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\" The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent."
