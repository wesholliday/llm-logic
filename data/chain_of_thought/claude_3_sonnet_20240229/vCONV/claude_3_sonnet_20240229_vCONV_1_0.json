            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven:\nPremise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nConclusion: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet M = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\nLet S = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nPremise: M \u2192 S (If M is true, then S is true)\nConclusion: S \u2192 M (If S is true, then M is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure of the argument.\nThe premise (M \u2192 S) states that if the antecedent (M) is true, then the consequent (S) must be true. However, it does not provide any information about the converse, which is the conclusion (S \u2192 M).\n\nStep 3: Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, if the premise \"If M, then S\" is true, it does not necessarily imply that the conclusion \"If S, then M\" is also true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This statement does not imply that \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (e.g., sprinklers, spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, in the given argument, the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not logically imply the conclusion \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
